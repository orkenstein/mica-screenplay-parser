N: The kids back away from the Hunter and his Darklings. But they have nowhere left to go. The Darklings close in... And suddenly the air fills with the sound of a ROCKET ENGINE. The kids glance skyward to see a SPACE SHUTTLE SCHOOL BUS swooping towards them like something out of a sci-fi movie -
C: TE
D: engines roaring and ray-gun blasters firing bright blasts of light that send the Darklings running.
N: When it lands, the hatch pops open and a space suit-clad explorer emerges. He quickly jumps to the ground and lifts

Where a red metal tank should be, there is a glass tank of liquid light. N 75 MR. OZ (CONT’D) 75 EE Use it on me... Today, Mateo! Oz swings around as Mateo fumbles with the extinguisher and finally -- HISS! Liquid light sprays onto Mr. Oswald. The bolt crackles and freezes into a solid shard, still jutting G horrifically out of his shoulder.
C: 76 IZZIE 76
D: I have sooo many questions...
N: Oz painfully scrambles through the cabin, the bolt lodged in his shoulder, knocking into everything he passes.
C: 77 MR. OZ 77

D: And I am a chimpanzee, thank you D
E: CONT’D
N: very much. The ship shudders - Oz peeks through the cockpit window to A see the Night Hunter has fired grappling hooks at the ship. Albert runs to the controls and the ship lurches into the air. The kids fall to the floor. Oz joins his co-pilot. N
C: 83 MR. OZ 83
