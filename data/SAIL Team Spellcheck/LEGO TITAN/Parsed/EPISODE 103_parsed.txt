C: IT
D: Arrgh! Stocks are soaring again... Logan shuffles forward in awe, the weirdness of the Dream World apparent all around him. Bodega Owner stops painting
C: ST
D: and looks up at the sky, which is full of psychedelic colors. As he looks back at the bodega, all the colorful GRAFFITI he covered immediately paints itself back. Newspaper Stand Guy struggles to catch his flock of flying papers and --
N: hops. This is MR. HOPPER. IN HONK! Logan stops short as a taxi screeches to a halt in front of him. His eyes go wide - the taxi is a toad. And it
C: MR. HOPPER 11 IS
D: Who needs a ride? Hop on in! Logan watches the pigeon on the trashcan pick up a briefcase in its beak, waddle into the taxi as it hops off. AV

S: INT. OZ’S ROCKET SHIP - DAY
N: Z Blob jiggles in his seat from the velocity of Oz’s ship rocketing through the dream ether. We see DREAM REALMS passing by outside the bus windows. 26 MR. OZ (O.S.) 26 The Dream World is a vast and wondrous place, full of different realms of the imagination... WIDEN OUT to reveal Mateo, Cooper, and Izzie in their seats.

C: 32 IZZIE 32
D: Oooh! Is it sushi night? AV
N: Izzie is about to unbuckle and stand when -- Oz jerks the controls. The bus banks hard. Logan stumbles. THWAP! His face pressed against a bus window, eyes scrunched D in pain.
C: 33 MR. OZ 33
D: -- and it is up to us to protect A
C: these realms from THAT!
D: Logan opens his eyes to see -- N
N: OUTSIDE -- The NIGHTMARE STORM SWIRLS IN THE ETHER... and out of the storm come -- EE NIGHT TERRORS... streaking towards the ship! Right at the window and -- LOGAN yells, pries himself from the glass... Oz and Albert G spring into evasive maneuvers as alarms start ringing on the control panel. 34 MR. OZ (CONT’D) 34 The Nightmare King has returned... Oz banks again. THWAP! Logan gets plastered against another window.
C: 35 LOGAN 35
D: The who?
E: muffled against glass

D: Nightmares! MATEO watches Oz pilot like a maniac as Albert frantically works the control panel --
C: ST 37 MATEO 37
D: How are we supposed to stop him? OZ excitedly turns to show the kids his hourglass stored at
C: 38 MR. OZ IN
D: his side. Taking his hands off the controls.
N: We will use all the tools at our disposal. Chief among them being
C: IS
D: the Dream Chaser’s Hourglass... The ship noses into a DIVE! Z Blob’s little eyes go wide as he jiggles. Izzie squeals in delight. Cooper holds on. Mateo AV
N: screams. Albert is unfazed. And Logan goes -- THWAP! into the front window, staring out as Oz’s ship PLOWS INTO SEVERAL NIGHT TERRORS! Collecting them on the front grill as the ship screams in a downward dive. D
C: 39 ALBERT 39
D: My god, son! Do you not know how to use a seatbelt? A
N: Albert presses a RED BUTTON. WHITE HOT ENERGY crackles across the bus and ZAP the Night Terrors like a bug zapper. N Albert pulls up out of the nose dive. The ship clears the Nightmare Storm for safer skies. Logan flops to the floor. EE
C: 40 IZZIE 40
D: Where do we get our hourglasses so we can join this fight? G
C: 41 ALBERT 41
D: That necessitates a visit to the Dream Forge... Logan sits up from the floor, woozy.

D: Is it close enough to walk? Logan collapses on the floor as we CUT TO --
C: TE
D: EXT. FOREST EDGE - FANTASY REALM - DAY We find Oz’s ship already landed beneath the clouds of Dream Ether hanging in the sky like fog. The kids stand before a trail that disappears into the dark woods. Oz and Albert
C: U

C: IT
D: We walk from here. The Dream Forge is on the other side of these woods, guarded by the Forgemaster.
C: ST 44 IZZIE 44
D: He sounds... serious.
C: 45 ALBERT 45
D: He most certainly is! A very
C: IN
D: powerful Dream World entity who will test your worthiness. Pass that test and you will face the Forge to acquire your hourglass.
C: IS 46 LOGAN 46
D: I don’t understand why we need a dumb hourglass. AV
C: 47 MR. OZ 47
D: Only the most exceptional become Dream Chasers, Logan. And to become a true Dream Chaser you need an hourglass. D
C: 48 LOGAN 48
D: Pshh, I’m the most exceptional one here. I bleed exceptional! See you A
N: at the forge, suckers! Logan takes off into the woods. N
C: 49 COOPER 49
D: Normally he hears the word “test,” EE
N: and runs in the opposite direction. Izzie laughs as she and Cooper head after Logan.
C: 50 MATEO 50
D: G
N: Mr. Oz, there’s usually a lesson before a test... or a study guide... I dunno, maybe some training? Oz casts a worried glance to the horizon --
C: 51 MR. OZ 51
D: There’s no time for self doubt, Mateo...
C: TE
D: THE NIGHTMARE STORM billows on the horizon. Growing. Spreading. Headed in their direction. 52 MR. OZ 52 The Nightmare King knows we’re
E: CONT’D
C: U
D: here. Albert sees the worried look on Mateo’s face. Pats him on the
C: IT
D: hand, trying to be reassuring.
C: 53 ALBERT 53
D: Worry not, young man! The best form
C: ST
D: of training is in fact being thrown from the nest and learning to fly! Albert heads after the others into the woods. 54 MR. OZ
C: IN
D: Don’t let him spook you. What’s the saying: “You always wake up before you hit the ground?” 54
C: IS
D: Oz chuckles. Mateo just stares at him. Clearly not reassured.
S: EXT. GORGE - FANTASY REALM - DAY
N: AV The crew emerges from the forest to find an old PLAYGROUND with a wooden jungle gym and sandbox. A KID, dressed in overalls, sits in the sandbox building sand castles. He looks up expectantly as the crew approaches. D
C: 55 LOGAN 55
D: What’s up, little man? Know where I can find the Dream Forge? A
N: The little kid assesses the crew. The kid trades a look with Oz, then shapes a sandcastle in the sandbox. And as he does -- N A MASSIVE SAND CASTLE TOWER forms in the distance. The others gawk. Logan smirks. EE
C: 56 LOGAN 56
D: So far I’m acing this test. The little kid jabs his hand in the sandbox, digs a huge G

D: Oz pulls his hourglass from the Velcro on his suit. 61 MR. OZ 61 And with an hourglass to focus, you
E: CONT’D

N: Cool lecture. Dream Forge is in that tower? We got to get inside? I got this... A Logan marches towards the bridge. The sandbox kid shoots Oz a look. And as Logan reaches the bridge, the doors to the tower swing open to reveal -- N A HUGE GNARLY SAND GOLEM KNIGHT, clad in heavy armor, hefting a mean-looking shield and mace. Logan hits the brakes.

D: Lacks creativity... EE
N: WHAM! Cooper goes flying off the bridge as WE CUT TO -- IZZIE -- standing before the bridge. She fumbles with her backpack, spilling a massive amount of plushies from her pack. She loses her balance and as she tries to catch them G all. Albert sighs.

D: There will be times when you don’t have one. Or when you run out of dream sand... What will you do
C: IN
D: then? Give up? No! Get creative, Mateo! You got this. Mateo’s eyes dart towards a rusty metal jungle gym ladder that juts out of the playground but leads to nowhere. He
C: IS
D: shakes off the idea momentarily forming in his head. Instead pulls out his trusty drawing pencil, and picks up Z Blob. Mateo dreamcrafts his pencil into a sword. He charges at the AV
N: opposing knight but WHAM! Mateo topples off the bridge. WE TRACK WITH MATEO as he and Z Blob plummet into the foggy depths of the gorge. Mateo screams as we CUT TO -- D
S: INT. MATEO AND IZZIE’S ROOM - DAWN

C: 78 IZZIE 78

N: Mateo lets out a frustrated sigh. Z Blob comes out of the backpack, rubbing his head, and yacks up the tiny bucket.
S: EXT. MATEO AND IZZIE’S BLOCK - DAY
N: G Mateo and Izzie hurry down their block. Backpacks on. They see the News Stand Guy organizing his financial magazines... the Bodega Owner painting... Mr. Hopper frowning as he honks his horn.

D: bridge? Nothing about the Dream World makes sense to me.
C: IT 81 MRS. CASTILLO 81

D: Mrs. Castillo, do you remember... anything about your dream last night? D

C: 86 IZZIE 86
D: OMG! I need that in my belly muy N

S: INT. CITY MIDDLE - CAFETERIA - DAY
N: G Mateo grasps his napkin sketch and marches up to the back table where COACH JEFFRIES presides over the SHEEP WEEK BRACKET posted on the back wall.

C: 95 IZZIE 95
D: Hamster, dude. Obvi. It’s Nova’s turn to watch him tonight. Science N
N: class stuff. But I haven’t seen her all day. I don’t know if she came to school... EE As Izzie walks off to look for Nova, Mateo realizes Z Blob is reaching out of his backpack to try and eat the sign up sheets on Coach Jeffrey’s table. G He quickly tucks Z back in his bag. Casts a worried look around and spots -- ZOEY... standing with her lunch tray. Staring skeptically.

C: 105 IZZIE 105
D: Look, none of us has an hourglass. EE
N: So how can we be expected to dreamcraft well enough to beat this scary old knight?
C: 106 LOGAN 106
D: G
N: I’m not scared.
C: 107 IZZIE 107
D: My point is, maybe this test is to get us to think outside the box. To think like a dream! The kid in the sandbox stops building his sandcastles. He
C: TE
D: looks up expectantly.
C: 108 MR. OZ 108
D: Very good, Izzie. Just because you are learning to dreamcraft, it
C: U

D: I mean if this is all like a dream or whatever... what if-- Mateo watches as Logan walks over to the rickety old ladder on the jungle gym. The one that leads to nowhere, like it

D: I say, the lughead did it. He reached the Forge. A
N: Cooper races to climb up. Izzie squeals with delight as she follows suit. Disappearing into the fog. N Mateo sighs. Reluctantly follows. Puts Z Blob in his backpack before climbing up. But as he climbs, Z Blob spits something EE out that falls to the ground... Oz picks it up - it’s the napkin from Mrs. C’s taco truck. Oz looks at the drawing. G IT’S A PICTURE OF MATEO CLIMBING THE LADDER WITH THE TEAM CLIMBING BEHIND HIM...
S: EXT. SANDCASTLE TOWER - DAY
N: As Oz, Albert, and the kids arrive at the tower, THE MASSIVE DOORS swing wide... they peer into the dark interior as -- The KID FROM THE SAND BOX emerges... his OLDER voice at odds

D: plates, so can we have our hourglasses now?
C: FORGEMASTER
D: You have proven you are not 116
C: IS
D: ordinary dreamers. But do you have what it takes to acquire an hourglass and become Dream Chasers? For that, you must face the Forge. AV
N: Mateo gazes into the dark confines of the tower. Worried...
C: 117 MATEO 117
D: What’s in the Forge? D
C: 118 FORGEMASTER 118
D: It's different for every dreamer. But know this: if you are not up to A
N: the task, the Dream Forge will exact a heavy toll... N
C: 119 IZZIE 119
D: Don’t worry, our dad puts funds on our subway metro card weekly. Ever EE
N: since I got stranded in Manhattan after a disastrous field trip to the Museum of Natural History.

D: G
N: He’s referring to those who are not prepared; for them, the Forge is too much. Their minds can't take it. (MORE)
C: ALBERT

D: forgetting the Dream World. I... I need some time to think about this.
N: Wait, Mateo... You may not have

N: But Mateo walks off. Izzie groans.

D: Would you cut it out. I’m not. A
C: 129 FORGEMASTER 129
D: They’re clearly not ready. And I N
