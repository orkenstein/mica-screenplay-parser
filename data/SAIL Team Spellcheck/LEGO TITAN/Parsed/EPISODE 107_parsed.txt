N: (off their blank stares) FREE DAY!
S: EXT. LOBBY, CYBER REALM (DREAM WORLD) - DAY
N: G Flying eight-bit birds soar past a tall, digital screen in the middle of a video game lobby resembling a town square. The lobby branches out into multiple roads, which guide dreamers toward various types of games. At its center is a huge, sixteen-bit statue of a muscular man wearing a spacesuit and cool helmet a la HALO’s MASTER CHIEF. The kids, Bunzai, and Z-Blob enter the realm with excitement.

C: 45 LOGAN 45
D: Ooh, too bad, Teo. Looks like Zoey D
N: doesn’t want to play with you here or Sheep Week. She wants to join a winning team. A Cooper, Izzie, Bunzai, and Z-Blob nervously watch on. N

D: No. No. Anything, but that. Not Baking Papa!

N: Logan runs and slides up to Mateo’s hiding place, thinking he can catch him off-guard. He turns the corner. Mateo is gone. EE Logan gasps before... PEW! PEW! He gets blasted and shattered a second time! This time from both Mateo AND Upgrade Z-Blob.

N: The group turns to see a Night Terror about to pounce onto G Mateo. Z-Blob makes a move toward him, but isn’t fast enough. Instead, Logan jumps in, tackling Mateo out of the way.
C: 140 MATEO 140

C: 146 BURRZERKER 146
D: Haha! Get some! Get some! Is this all you’ve got! D
N: Burrzerker tosses a mechanical looking grenade at the ground. POW! It explodes light, obliterating the rest of Night A Terrors. He valorously turns toward the kids.

N: Cooper pumps his fist up, but his win is interrupted when another virus glitch causes another fissure to open up. His truck’s wheels get stuck. He tries to speed out, but can’t. A
C: 161 LOGAN 161

N: Just then, a ton of nightmare creatures bombard them, EE climbing all over, attempting to get inside and attack.
C: 162 COOPER 162
D: There’s too many! We need reinforcements! G
N: Not a moment too soon, Zoey dives in on Zion, using her time- altering clock to land multiple quick attacks on the beasts. For the second time, Logan and Mateo are heavily impressed.
C: 163 MATEO/LOGAN 163

N: As soon as Logan groans out of frustration, sand particles float around their monster truck TRANSFORMING it into a

N: Oz whips out a blue floppy disk.
C: 182 MR. OZ 182

S: EXT. SKY, CYBER REALM (DREAM REALM) - MEANWHILE
N: Zoey soars toward Mr. Sharkface atop of Zion. They avoid the G Night Terrors flying at them like a spaceship avoiding asteroids. The Dark Archer checks over the ledge of Mr. Sharkface, taking note of her quick and daring approach. The Dark Archer gives his signature whistle, further aggravating Zoey. However, as she’s about to reach him, a glitchy cloud appears in front of her. She flies though it, but then it turns solid, trapping her and Zion inside. Just as they’re about to crash land, Burrzerker tuck and rolls into action, catching them before they can make impact.

C: 198 MATEO 198
D: If anything ever happened to Z-Blob I’d feel the exact same way. G
N: (then) It’s ok. We got this. Z-Blob and the boys run out from their hiding place, using their video game surroundings to blast through enemies and rocket jump away from the horde coming at them. Izzie watches, feeling uneasy as they get overwhelmed. She removes Bunzai from her bag and dreamcrafts him back to his kick-butt size.
C: 199 IZZIE 199

C: 205 LOGAN 205
D: G
N: Let’s rock and roll. Cooper, Z-Blob, Izzie, and Bunzai hold the enemies off on the outskirts, while Mateo acts as main defense for Logan. He shoots whatever he can as they run toward the center. Each time that Logan gets held up, he tosses the disk to Mateo, and vice versa. It’s a true tag team effort. Finally, Logan gets to the slot. He kicks off the front panel of the tablet and yanks out the red disk. He slams the blue disk into the slot. The red lights within the realm change back to blue. The realm begins to heal itself.
C: TE 206 MATEO 206
