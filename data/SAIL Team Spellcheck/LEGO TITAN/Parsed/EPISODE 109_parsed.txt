D: You’re acting pretty sus, dude.
E: backing away
C: 7 LANCE 7 (Lance and NK voices
D: overlapping) Give it to me!
N: In a swirl of red mist, Lance unveils his true self... the NIGHTMARE KING! Logan gapes, horror filling his face. 8 LOGAN 8

D: As a swarm of snickering Darklings burst into the clearing, Logan looks around desperately. No escape. SNIVEL, SNEAK, and SUSAN brandish their weapons.

D: I can’t find him anywhere.

D: AV

C: 20 COOPER 20 * A trillion times.
D: A
N: Coop dials, holds up his cellphone. Teo and Izzie look * N hopeful but it goes straight to voicemail -- 21 LOGAN (OVER VOICEMAIL) 21 EE Yo yo yo, you know what to do. Coop jabs at his phone angrily. Hangs up. * G
C: 22 IZZIE 22
D: Do you think something’s wrong? Maybe we should--
C: 23 COOPER 23 *
D: What’s wrong is Logan ditched us!
C: 24 IZZIE 24
D: What?!
C: 25 COOPER 25 *
D: His phone always goes straight to voicemail when he’s at the Hamptons with his Moms.

N: Whatever you’re about to ask, Isabelle... the answer is ‘no.’ A
C: 31 IZZIE 31
D: C’mon Coach, Logan’s sick. We need N

C: 32 IZZIE 32
D: Hmm, I wonder if Principal Williams * would like to know you don’t pay * G
E: CONT’D
N: for your smoothies at the * cafeteria... * BACK ON Mateo and Coop. They watch with shock as Izzie * triumphantly marches towards them flashing a thumbs up. In the B.G., Jeffries shakes his head with reluctant admiration. Coop turns to Mateo and sighs, still bummed. *
C: 33 COOPER 33 *
D: It doesn’t matter. We’ll never find someone as good as Logan. We can kiss our chances of winning goodbye.
C: 34 MATEO 34 *
D: Look, Coop. Even if we’re down our * best player... and even if I’m not

N: WIDEN TO REVEAL Logan staring up at the ominous SHADOWKEEP. He watches with mounting fear as Night Terrors slink through N the swirling mist. The Nightmare King, on his NIGHT MARE, is welcomed home by his loud and boisterous Darkling army. As Susan prods Logan forward with her spear, CUT TO: EE

C: 39 COOPER 39 *
D: Ugh, how is everyone in our class already on a team?! Keep practicing!
E: then
N: WHIP to Mateo close to the wall, heading a soccer ball * against it, <WHAP>. He is terrible but at least he’s trying. *
C: 40 MATEO 40 *
D: Isn’t it weird that football’s called football and you play with your hands but soccer’s called soccer and you play with your feet?
C: TE
D: By the fridge, Z Blob pauses from squirting whipped cream into his mouth to shrug. Bubbling with excitement, Izzie enters carrying a box. She halts at the sight of her brother.

E: to Coop

D: What’s he doing?
N: 42 COOPER 42 *
C: ST
D: Your brother’s got two left feet but he’s kinda smart, so I figured let’s see if he can use his head.
C: 43 MATEO IN
D: Watch, I’m getting good!
N: On cue, Mateo throws the ball a little too hard at the wall. 43 *

N: 44 MATEO (CONT’D) 44 * Ow! AV Izzie plonks the bix box onto the table and starts pulling out dress-up clothes. D
C: 45 IZZIE 45

C: 46 IZZIE 46
D: We don’t need to find a replacement for Logan. Not when we’ve got one EE
E: CONT’D
N: right here! We disguise Z Blob as a student and he can play tomorrow! Coop gapes, Z Blob grins, Mateo panics. * G
C: 47 MATEO 47 *
D: Unh-uh, not happening. No way I’m risking Z Blob being seen again. *
C: 48 IZZIE 48
D: Why not? I bet Z Blob’s a great * soccer player.
E: pouty
C: 49 COOPER 49 *

D: I’ve got it covered. The answer to

D: our Logan problem will be here any--
C: IT
D: DING-DONG. All eyes whip to the front door. Mateo steels * himself, heads over. Coop turns to Izzie, raises an eyebrow: *
C: ST 51 IZZIE 51
D: * No clue. *
E: shrugs
C: IN
D: They both look at Z Blob, who shrugs. He’s in the dark, too.
N: At the door, Mateo takes a deep breath and opens it to reveal ZOEY. Coop and Izzie fist bump without looking at each other.
C: IS
D: Zoey cocks an eyebrow at them.
C: 52 COOPER/IZZIE 52 *
D: Hey Zoey! / Sooooo good to see you. * AV
C: 53 ZOEY 53

C: 54 IZZIE 54
D: N
N: With EXTRA JALAPENOS?! * Zoey rolls her eyes as Teo fumbles to pull out some sweaty * EE ones as a tip. He blushes, embarrassed, when a cutesy Pokémon- * style drawing of Z Blob falls out, too. He scoops it up. *
C: 55 MATEO 55 *
D: G
N: Uh, thanks for coming over Zoey.
C: 56 ZOEY 56
D: I kinda had to... since I deliver * the tacos. *
C: 57 MATEO 57 *
D: <AWKWARD LAUGH> Oh yeah. *
N: Zoey thrusts the bag of tacos forward. Z Blob darts over, * grabs the bag, and scarfs some tacos -- wrapper and all.
C: 58 ZOEY 58
D: You sure the little green guy can handle the heat? Mrs. C does NOT go * easy on the jalapenos. *
N: Clearly distracted by his nerves, Mateo waves away her *

E: mouth full of taco
N: Ditched us to go on vacay.
C: 64 ZOEY 64
D: Huh. Look, I get that you guys care D
N: about stupid Sheep Week, but I * don’t. Things are a little intense * for me right now and I need to stay * A focused on the important stuff. N Embarrassed, Mateo lashes out: *
C: 65 MATEO 65 *
D: EE
N: Yeah, like totally stalking the * Dark Archer, right? Zoey bristles, PISSED. She pulls the door shut -- SLAMMING it G in Teo’s face. He turns around, stricken. Izzie pats his * shoulder, sympathetic.
C: 66 IZZIE 66
D: It was a good idea. *
N: Seeing Coop’s face fall, Mateo makes a snap decision. *
C: 67 MATEO 67 *
D: Z Blob can play.
N: Izzie squeals with excitement, grabs a handful of clothes and * yanks Z Blob offscreen.
C: 68 IZZIE 68

C: 71 COOPER 71 *
D: Not at all!
C: IN

D: Introducing Brooklyn City Middle’s latest foreign exchange student... AV
N: Monsieur Z Pierre! She steps aside, CLOSE ON Teo and Coop, whose eyes widen. * D

D: Huh. / Yoikes. * A
N: REVERSE TO REVEAL: Z-Blob is still a small pile of slime * except now he’s rocking a BERET, a SCARF and brandishing a * N BAGUETTE. <BLINK-BLINK> Even Izzie has to face facts -- *

N: BLAARGH! As Z Blob yaks green-blob all over Teo, CUT TO -- *
S: 6 INT. SHADOWKEEP - DAY - CONTINUOUS 6
N: The Nightmare King, perched insolently on his throne, surveys the scene. Luna’s Hourglass sits on a pedestal in the middle of the room. Logan (hands shackled) stands uncomfortably next to the DARK ARCHER. Around them, Darklings push and shove,
C: TE
D: jockeying for the best view of the Hourglass.
N: A scuffle breaks. A Darkling stumbles and bumps the pedestal with the hourglass. It wobbles precariously before
C: U
D: stabilizing. Silence descends.

D: <FRIGHTENED SQUEAL> *
N: BOOSH! A shadow bolt THUDS into the Darkling disintegrating it into DREAM ETHER, which falls to the floor. The keep ROARS

D: N
N: Behold! After many long nights of searching, our dark lord has finally obtained Luna’s Hourglass! EE (holds up the hourglass) Tonight, he will locate Castle * Nocturna and destroy it once and * for all! G The Darklings cackle with glee as the NK slinks over to receive the Hourglass. He smiles menacingly.
C: 81 NIGHTMARE KING 81
D: I’ll enjoy seeing the Castle one last time...
N: The Nightmare King raises the Hourglass... The Darklings lean forward in anticipation... Logan FLINCHES, anticipating the shock wave about to hit. But then -- Nothing. The Hourglass stays dark and lifeless. The Dark Archer gasps, surprised. Darklings cower as the Nightmare King HOWLS in frustration. Turns on the DA, menacing -- 82 NIGHTMARE KING (CONT’D) 82
C: TE
D: You told me despite it’s disrepair, * Luna’s Hourglass would work. *
N: 83 DARK ARCHER 83
C: U
D: I’m-I’m sorry. I thought it would-- *
C: IT
D: Furious, the NK points his staff at the Dark Archer, who winces, anticipating the worst...
C: ST
D: BOOM! A shadow bolt STREAKS past the Dark Archer and EXPLODES the Darklings’ smoothie bar in a shower of smoothie, sparks, and dream ether.
C: IN
D: PAN OVER to Snivel, Susan, and Sneak drenched in smoothie, sniffling sadly.
C: NIGHTMARE KING 84 IS

S: 7 EXT. CITY MIDDLE - FIELD – NEXT DAY 7

C: 85 JADYN 85 *
D: Better get your tacos fast, N
N: Brooklyn! It’s almost time for some Sheep Week soccer! EE WHIP TO Mateo and Coop on a bench looking a little green. * Izzie considers the crowd, unfazed.
C: 86 IZZIE 86
D: G
N: Guess we shoulda told everyone we were gonna forfeit before this, huh? The boys groan and slump even further.
S: 8 EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY 8
N: ANGLE ON Mrs. C, watching the boys intently from her perch in the food truck. She whistles comically loudly. Zoey darts back to the truck laden down with deliveries.
C: 87 ZOEY 87

C: 89 MATEO
D: Zoey, wait up! IN 89 *
C: IS
D: Zoey reluctantly slows to a stop. Teo dives in: *
N: 90 MATEO (CONT’D) 90 * I just wanted to say I’m sorry. I AV shouldn’t have made that crack about the Dark Archer. Whatever’s going on is your business, okay? D Zoey softens almost imperceptibly at Mateo’s apology. * 91 MATEO (CONT’D) 91 * A But I’m here if you ever want to talk... N A pregnant beat. But Zoey’s not ready. EE 92 MATEO (CONT’D) 92 * And just for the record, Sheep Week is kinda stupid. It’s just... I’m trying to win for Coop and Izzie. I * G don’t want to let them down. Mateo waits for a response but Zoey’s clearly distracted. * 93 MATEO (CONT’D) 93 * (a little frustrated) I know you’re not gonna join our team and everything, but I just wanted you to know the truth. From ZOEY’S POV, we see the Wolves hassling Coop and Izzie. * DALLAS, their team Captain and a born bully, aggressively * bumps Izzie and swipes one of the plushy keychains off her
C: TE
D: backpack.
N: Oblivious to what’s happening, Mateo rolls his eyes. *

D: us at soccer? I don’t think so. You’re down a player so it’s forfeit city for you losers. AV
N: Just then, he catches sight of Zoey marching menacingly up to him and instinctively shrinks back. She gets in his face.
C: 97 ZOEY 97
D: D
N: Stop picking on my teammates. * It’s a toss-up over who is more stunned -- the Wolves or the * A Dream Chasers. Dallas gapes. Izzie squeals, ecstatic. * N
C: 98 IZZIE 98
D: Oh yeah, uh-huh. You turkeys are going down! EE
N: Izzie plucks her plushy out of the still-stunned Dallas’ hand * as Zoey pivots... stalks across the field to Coach Jeffries... thrusts the bag of tacos at him. G
C: 99 ZOEY 99
D: Dream Chasers are ready whenever you are Coach.
N: OFF Coach Jeffries’ surprise, we CUT TO:
S: 10 INT. SHADOWKEEP - CONTINUOUS 10
N: WIDE on a dank, oppressive dungeon. The light cast by flickering torches barely penetrates the gloom. PUSH IN on one cell bathed in shadows... through the bars to... a lonely figure huddled in the corner. The sound of sad sniffles echoes off the stone chamber.
C: TE
D: As our eyes adjust to the gloom... reveal the sniffles belong to Logan. But not like we’ve ever seen him before. This Logan is frightened, alone, and filled with doubt.
C: U
D: Suddenly, he hears rustling nearby. His head SNAPS up and he looks around, scared.
C: IT 100 LOGAN 100

D: A
E: CONT’D
N: My dude, you do not wanna test me. N But Sneak’s not giving up so easy. He YANKS hard. Logan stumbles. THWAP! He gets plastered against the bars, eyes scrunched in pain. EE Logan opens his eyes to see -- Sneak about to slobber on him. Logan yelps, pushes off from G the bars YANKING on the backpack with all his might. But Sneak anticipates the move and suddenly lets go! As Logan tumbles head over heels, his hat goes flying. The contents of the backpack -- pens, books, and a bag of chile limón chips -- spill across the floor. Sneak greedily reaches through the cell bars and grabs the chips and Logan’s hat. He plops it on his head and swaggers back and forth doing a pretty accurate Logan impression.
C: 104 SNEAK 104
D: My dude, you do not wanna test me.
E: mimicking Logan
N: Logan almost cracks a smile, catches himself.
C: TE 105 LOGAN 105

T: It’s ridiculous but kinda cute.

D: D
E: CONT’D
N: Actually looks pretty good on you. Sneak puffs his chest, pleased. One hat and one bag of chips A richer, he turns to leave. Catches sight of Logan, forlorn... N SCHWOOP! Sneak opens the bag of chips. Cautiously thrusts the bag through the bars to Logan, who looks at the chips, torn. EE
C: 110 LOGAN 110
D: Chile limón are my favorite...
E: CONT’D
N: Sneak cocks his head, confused. G
C: 111 LOGAN 111
D: OMG! You’ve never had chile limón * chips before?
E: CONT’D
N: Logan scooches over to the bars. Grabs a chip but waits for Sneak to grab one of his own. At the same time... CRUNCH. * Sneak’s eyes widen in delight.
C: 112 SNEAK 112
D: Whoa.
E: mind blown
N: As Logan and Sneak happily munch on chips, we PULL OUT. Camera flies through the dungeon... up a seeming endless staircase... to the THRONE ROOM. WINGED DARKLINGS swarm the corridors, flooding up and out of *
