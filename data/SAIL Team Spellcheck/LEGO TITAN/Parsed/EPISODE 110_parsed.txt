S: 1 EXT. CITY MIDDLE - ESTABLISHING 1
N: A bright sunny day in the city. STUDENTS scamper into the building. We hear the SQUELCH of a PA sytem. Then -- 1 COACH JEFFREYS (O.S.) 1 It’s been an... interesting Sheep Week here at City Middle...
S: 2 INT. CITY MIDDLE - CAFETERIA STAGE - DAY 2
N: STUDENTS and TEACHERS gather around the cafeteria stage. Sheep Week regalia covers the walls. COACH JEFFREYS stands on stage, mic in hand, ready to hand out trophies that JADYN awkwardly prepares on a nearby table.
C: 2 COACH JEFFREYS 2
D: But the team that defied expectation and overcame the odds to become this year’s champions... Jadyn attempts a drum roll on the table. 3 COACH JEFFREYS 3 The Nobodies! Jadyn knocks over several of the trophies. There is a smattering of disinterested applause. 4 COACH JEFFREYS 4 Nobodies? DALLAS’S TEAM, THE WOLVES sullenly looks on as Coach, trophy in hand, scans the room. Makes eye contact with MS. PUTNAM who shrugs her shoulders. NOVA and several of her Nightmare Club cohorts look around, whisper conspiratorially. 5 COACH JEFFREYS 5 What kind of team skips out on their own award?! How do you know you’re champions if you don’t have a trophy that says so?! Dallas reaches out to touch the 1ST PLACE TROPHY. Coach smacks his hand away.
E: CONT’D CONT’D smile fading CONT’D growing distraught
S: 3 INT. MR. OZ’S CLASSROOM - DAY 3
N: MATEO, IZZIE, COOPER and ZOEY gather in front of MR. OZ at his desk. He looks up from grading papers, confused.
C: 6 MR. OZ 6
D: Guys... why aren’t you at the assembly? Mateo trades an uneasy look with his friends. Looks up solemnly to Mr. Oz --
C: 7 MATEO 7
D: Because it doesn’t mean anything without Logan... Oz stops grading. Concern washes over his face...
C: 8 MR. OZ 8
D: What do you mean? Mateo, where is Logan? Off of Mateo’s worried look --
E: beat
C: TITLE SEQUENCE ROLLS
D: Music swells... and we HARD CUT TO --
S: 4 EXT. GRIM REALM - DAY 4
N: A Craggy, fog-shrouded marshland full of hills and caves, barren trees, and hopeless skies. In the distance, the
C: ominous SHADOWKEEP looms...
D: Oz and the kids emerge from the DREAM BRIDGE DOOR and behold the frightening vista.
C: 9 IZZIE 9
D: I still don’t get it, how did Logan end up here? What was he doing?
C: 10 MR. OZ 10
D: I suspect Luna’s Hourglass had something to do with it...
C: 11 MATEO 11
D: What?!
C: 12 MR. OZ 12
D: Someone took it from my office at the Night Bureau.
C: 13 COOPER 13
D: Dude... what was he thinking...
C: 14 ZOEY 14
D: He was probably feeling left out! You ever think about that when you’re running around dreamcrafting all the time?
C: 15 MATEO 15
D: Wait, are you actually defending him? He totally stole that hourglass and now we gotta get it back before--
C: 16 MR. OZ 16
D: Okay, okay... Look, right now the most important thing is rescuing Logan before the Nightmare King knows we’re here. A piercing SHRIEK prompts everyone to look to the sky as they see a NIGHT TERROR patroling on the horizon...
C: 17 ZOEY 17
D: Might be too late...
C: 18 IZZIE 18
D: Not if I can help it.
E: determined
C: 19 MR. OZ 19
D: Wait, No! Izzie-- Izzie whips out her hourglass, begins to dreamcraft... light from the swirling sand shining out like a lighthouse in the gloomy landscape as -- 20 MR. OZ 20 This place is so devoid of happiness and creativity, any display of imagination becomes a target! THE NIGHT TERROR suddenly banks hard, immediately zeroing in on Izzie as she crafts Bunzai... Uh oh... The kids scramble for cover by a NIGHTMARISH TREE as the Night Terror screams inbound!
E: CONT’D
C: 21 COOPER 21
D: Sooo... you’re saying we’re behind enemy lines and can’t dreamcraft?! Izzie grits her teeth, jumps onto Bunzai, hefting her weapon as the Night Terror shrieks towards them, claws out and -- WHAM! Izzie and Bunzai leap up and take it out in one well placed blow! They land and she shoots Oz a cocky look -- As she smiles, she doesn’t notice the nightmare tree behind her slowly reaching out, looming with its claw branches --
C: 22 MATEO 22
D: Izzie!
N: Bunzai freaks. Rears up, spilling Izzie to the ground as the tree reaches out and -- BLAM! The nightmare tree gets obliterated. The kids turn to see Oz holding his telescope rifle. A stern look on his face.
C: 23 MR. OZ 23
D: I’m saying make it count! Look gang, it’s not just the Nightmare King’s forces we gotta worry about here. So we need to be disciplined and work together if we’re going to save Logan. Understood? The kids all trade a fearful look.
E: composes himself
C: 24 ALBERT 24
D: Do try and hurry. I will keep the bridge door open as long as I can. But just in case... Albert gives Oz a small shiny metal ball contraption.
C: 25 COOPER 25
D: We all get new toys for this mission?
E: grabs the contraption
C: 26 ALBERT 26
D: Young man, the Edison Bomb is not a toy, it’s a failsafe.
E: hands it back to Oz
C: 27 MR. OZ 27
D: Plan B. When it detonates, it emits pure daylight. Bad news for any nightmare creatures in its radius.
E: off Coop’s confusion
C: 28 IZZIE 28
D: Okay, alright... Storming the Shadowkeep! We can do this! What’s the plan? You’ve been in there, right Mr. Oz?
E: getting amped up
C: 29 MR. OZ 29
D: Whu-- You don’t just stroll into the Shadowkeep! We’re not on a field trip to a museum - this whole place is basically a wasteland of fears, phobias, and regret...
E: off guard
C: 30 ALBERT 30
D: What your esteemed teacher is trying to say is... no.
C: 31 ZOEY 31
D: Great, how are we supposed to sneak in there and find Logan if nobody’s ever been inside?
C: 32 MATEO 32
D: I don’t think we’re sneaking anywhere... C’mon! Mateo points in the distance: a small PATROL OF DARKLINGS on a hill spots the kids. The gang darts off towards the Darklings in the distance. We linger on the ominous keep at the horizon as a nightmare storm swirls in the sky. A SCREAM of pain prelaps and we --
E: spotting something
S: 5 INT. SHADOWKEEP - DAY 5
N: SNEAK, SNIVEL, and SUSAN escort LOGAN through a dank, twisty tunnel. Coming to a stop outside the doors to the FEAR WORKS. DARK ARCHER stands with them, nursing his backside, shooting an accusing glare at the spear Sneak is holding.
C: 33 DARK ARCHER 33
D: How many times have a told you to watch where you point that thing! Archer smacks Sneak. Snivel and Susan howl with laughter. Archer shoots them a look. They button it up. He sighs. 34 DARK ARCHER 34 No matter how hard you try, fools never change... Archer motions threateningly, Sneak unlocks the dungeon door. 35 DARK ARCHER 35 The foolish and the weak... Archer shakes his head at Logan. 36 DARK ARCHER 36 Nightmare King coulda’ helped you stop being both, kid. The door swings open. Logan’s eyes go wide: There before him is a room full of CONTAINMENT UNITS - dreaming KIDS in each one, their imaginations being siphoned out and funneled away by horrendous machinery.
E: CONT’D CONT’D turns to Logan CONT’D
C: 37 LOGAN 37
D: Like he’s helped you? How’s that working out? You’re one screw up away from being thrown in here with me... Archer hesitates. The other Darklings trade a look.
E: trying to act tough
C: 38 LOGAN 38
D: I know the feeling, bro. Lemme outta here before my friends show up and stop this whole freakshow. I’ll put in a good word for you.
E: CONT’D
C: 39 DARK ARCHER 39
D: You really don’t get it do you... Once we find Castle Nocturna and destroy it, NO ONE will be able to stop the Nightmare King. Archer locks eyes with Logan. Logan flinches. Dark Archer laughs. The gravity of the situation slams home with Logan. 40 DARK ARCHER 40 Here’s the sad truth kid, your friends aren’t coming because they don’t need you. Logan looks up at the Dark Archer, clearly wounded. 41 DARK ARCHER 41 You’re a loser, Logan.
E: CONT’D CONT’D straight to the point
C: 42 SNIVEL 42
D: Hehehe, Loser Logan! Loser Logan! Logan trades a look with SNEAK who can’t meet his gaze.
C: 43 DARK ARCHER 43
D: Little bit of advice: choose better friends. Archer laughs as he turns and walks back down the hall. Snivel turns to the other two.
C: 44 SNIVEL 44
D: Ssooo, who gets the honors? Sneak shoves Logan into the unit. The door CLANGS shut. He goes to lock it but fumbles with the keys, dropping them. Snivel growls, motions to Susan who barrels forwards and WHAM! Knocks Sneak to the ground. She looms over his limp body and picks up the keys.
C: 45 SUSAN 45
D: You’re just as weak and pathetic as this loser here -- Snivel turns and realizes the containment unit is empty. Logan is missing! He casts a panicked look around and sees -- LO-LO, in full blue gremlin mode, swing off the top of the unit and -- SLAM! Two feet right to Snivel’s face, sends him to the ground. Susan ROARS and CHARGES toward Lo-Lo like a freight train but -- LO-LO jumps up, grabbing the containment unit cage and swinging out of the way as SUSAN rams into the nearby wall - slumping to the ground, out like a light. Lo-Lo lands back on the ground chest heaving, and stares down at Susan --
C: 46 LO-LO 46
D: Who’s the loser now... He hears the sound of metal on stone and his eyes glance up to find -- SNEAK standing in front of the exit, spear in hand. Lo-Lo locks eyes with Sneak... And Sneak lowers the spear. Lo-Lo slowly transitions back into Logan.
C: 47 LOGAN 47
D: Why are you helping me? What’s in it for you?
C: 48 SNEAK 48
D: Better friends.
E: beat
S: 6 EXT. GRIM REALM - CANYON - MOMENTS LATER 6
N: The PATROL OF ROWDY DARKLINGS snakes through the fog, cackles echoing. As they round a bend in the canyon, they don’t see -- THE DREAM CHASERS hiding amidst the rocks. The patrol marches past, bickering. As Mateo prepares to dreamcraft, Oz puts a restraining hand on him. Mateo frowns.
C: 49 MATEO 49
D: <GROWLS> What am I supposed to do
C: if I can’t dreamcraft?
D: 50 Izzie 50 What would Logan do?
E: whispers
C: 51 ZOEY 51
D: Well, he certainly wouldn’t waste time talking about it... Zoey winds her clock. The whisps of fog suddenly seem to move backwards as TIME SLOWS... and Zoey darts out, her clock ticking, manipulating the scenario to close in on -- THE PATROL OF DARKLINGS -- Zoey makes quick work of the patrol. Defeating three out of four. As she closes in on the LAST DARKLING, we watch in SLOW MOTION as his little face washes with alarm and -- Zoey’s clock stops ticking... Time resumes normally.
E: hisses
C: 52 IZZIE 52 WAIT! Don’t hurt him...
D: Zoey has Last Darkling in her sights. Arrow aimed... she hesitates... trades a glance from Izzie to Mateo.
C: 53 MATEO 53
D: We do need someone to guide us to the Shadowkeep...
E: shrugs
C: 54 ZOEY 54
D: Fine...
E: sighs
C: 55 COOPER 55
D: Uh guys... our guide is running away. The kids glance back to see the Darkling scrambling away through the canyon.
C: 56 MR. OZ 56
D: We can’t let him warn the others! Mateo growls as they run after the fleeing Darkling.
S: 7 INT. SHADOWKEEP - DAY 7
N: A SWARM of NIGHT TERRORS snakes down the hall and flitters up through a tunnel-like passageway. As soon as they’re gone, Sneak peeks out from behind a shadowy corner. Signals behind him, and Logan quickly follows.
C: 57 SNEAK 57
D: That leads out of the Shadowkeep...
E: points at tunnel
N: We don’t want to get caught inside when more Night Terrors come through. The unlikely team slips out of their hiding spot and into the tunnel. But Logan shoots a glance at a room as they pass by and sees the Dark Archer standing at a worktable, tinkering
C: with LUNA’S HOURGLASS.
D: Dark Archer howls in frustration. SUSAN scurries down the hall. Sneak pulls Logan into the shadows as the Darkling passes. Logan strains to get a look --
C: IN THE WORKSHOP 58 DARK ARCHER 58
D: I said I didn’t want to be disturbed!
C: 59 SUSAN 59
D: The loser has escaped... Archer puts the hourglass down. Anger surges through him.
C: 60 DARK ARCHER 60
D: How...
C: 61 SUSAN 61
D: Sneak...
C: 62 DARK ARCHER 62
D: And yet His Scariness will blame me... Archer stands abruptly. 63 DARK ARCHER 63 But not if I find him first. ANGLE ON LOGAN as he recedes into the shadows of the tunnel.
E: CONT’D
C: 64 SUSAN 64
D: Gotta hurry, boss. I heard Dream Chasers are in the Grim Realm.
C: 65 DARK ARCHER 65
D: Ahh, The loser has friends after all. Logan’s face washes with realization. Logan watches as Archer puts the hourglass in a heavy CHEST and then quickly exits with Susan in tow.
C: 66 SNEAK 66
D: C’mon! What are you doing?
C: 67 LOGAN 67
D: Making things right... Logan makes sure the coast is clear and darts across the corridor to the -- WORKSHOP -- And finds the chest. But it’s locked. Logan gets frustrated as Sneak scurries over.
C: 68 SNEAK 68
D: We’re running out of time. Any minute that tunnel will be flooded with more Terrors...
E: hisses
C: 69 LOGAN 69
D: I can’t get this thing open--
C: 70 SNEAK 70
D: Of course you can’t! What were you thinking?!
C: 71 LOGAN 71
D: I don’t know! Mateo is usually the one to plan things out! Logan’s frustration boils over. He morphs into LO-LO... immediately starts pounding on the chest to no avail. He turns his angry little eyes to Sneak... Who fishes around under the worktable... and produces a SKELETON KEY. He holds it out as Logan transitions back into his normal appearance, scowling. Logan takes the key.
E: growing frustrated
C: 72 LOGAN 72
D: Don’t you start with me too... Night Terror shrieks suddenly echo down the hall.
E: CONT’D
C: 73 SNEAK 73
D: Move it or lose it, Stinkbrain! Logan quickly unlocks the chest, finds Luna’s hourglass waiting. Logan grabs it and the two run.
S: 8 INT. SHADOWKEEP - TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER 8
N: Logan and Sneak flee down the tunnel. Logan looks back over his shoulder. Can hear the Night Terror SHRIEKS getting louder. They get to a JUNCTION - Logan can see light above where one tunnel slopes up. And another that slopes down into darkness.
C: 74 SNEAK 74
D: Climb! Sneak starts up. The SHRIEKS grow louder, almost on top of them. Logan follows but can’t get enough traction. He slips and begins to slide.
C: 75 SNEAK 75
D: Stinkbrain! Sneak reaches out and catches Logan, poised above the darkness and the tunnel below. Logan locks eyes with him.
E: CONT’D
C: 76 LOGAN 76
D: Don’t you let me go-- Sneak releases his grip and Logan drops down the tunnel into the darkness as we CUT TO --
S: 9 EXT. GRIM REALM - HILLS 9
N: The Dream Chasers scurry around a bend to find a fog-laden gulch dominated by a large cave opening at the end. Mateo glances around... nothing but a few scraggly trees looming in the fog. No Darkling in sight. As Cooper walks beneath a tree, he wipes cobwebs from his face. Gets a chill. Izzie spots something. GASP! The team turns to see her pick up a Darkling weapon from the ground... It’s covered in webs.
C: 77 MATEO 77
D: Ugh, of course there’s spiders in the Grim Realm... Clicks and hisses echo out as a dozen little eyes appear in the darkness of the cave opening...
C: 78 MR. OZ 78
D: Contrary to popular belief, dreaming of spiders isn’t necessarily a bad thing-- The eyes move forward in unison, emerging from the darkness to reveal -- ONE GIANT NIGHTMARE SPIDER who creepily steps into the light!
C: 79 ZOEY 79
D: Uhh, yeah. That is totally a bad thing right there. The spider rears up, mandibles reaching for the dreamers as it ROARS!
C: 80 MR. OZ 80 RUN!
D: The group scrambles away as the beast scuttles out. Cooper trips and falls and -- WHAM! A giant hairy leg nearly skewers him. Zoey scoops Coop up and they keep running. Mateo suddenly veers off.
C: 81 ZOEY 81
D: This is why I hate field trips... Teo! C’mon!
E: to Mateo
C: 82 MATEO 82
D: Go! I’ll catch up! Zoey doesn’t need to be told twice. She drags Izzie with her.
C: 83 IZZIE 83
E: reaching back
C: MATEO! 84 MR. OZ 84
D: What are you doing?!
C: 85 MATEO 85
D: Making it count. Go! Find Logan! Teo takes hold of his hourglass. Light emanates like a beacon. The spider’s gaze immediately shifts from the group to Mateo, as he dreamcrafts Z Blob into Sir Z.
C: 86 MATEO 86
D: Yeah... over here big guy. You want some of this? Lotta shiny creativity right here... Z Blob swings his sword at the ready. The giant spider fixes all of its eyes on Mateo, saliva dripping from its mandibles.
E: CONT’D
C: 87 MATEO 87
D: Let’s see how well you fight with seven legs! Spider LUNGES! Z Blob swings! The sword bounces off his leg with a THUNK. The spider blinks and opens his mandibles. Z shoots a worried look to Mateo.
E: CONT’D
C: 88 MATEO 88
D: Got any better ideas? The spider roars! Mateo and Z turn and run! Scrambling and fighting up the hill, leading the giant spider from the others as they run away.
E: CONT’D
N: It’s an epic swashbuckling fight up the craggy Grim Realm hills -- Z and Teo working in tandem to fight and deflect as the giant spider pursues them. Teo and Z crest the hill to see a nightmarish SWAMP laid out before them. Mateo glances back in time to see -- THWUMP! A glob of webbing shoot out, snagging Z who falls to the ground. Teo doubles back, tugging and hacking to try and free his friend as the SPIDER scurries towards them and -- SNAP! Z is free! But the momentum carries them backwards -- TUMBLING down the hill! The fall reduces Z back into blob form, rolling off the hill and they -- SPLASH! Disappear into the foggy waters of the swamp... The giant spider scuttles up to the crest. Eyes scanning the murk below. Clicking and hissing. But Mateo and Z Blob are nowhere to be found and we --
T: CUT TO BLACK...
S: 10 EXT. SHADOWKEEP - DAY 10
N: Night Terrors flood up and out of the Shadowkeep and into the gloomy sky. Our gaze drifts down to the surrounding murk... WHOOSH! Logan and Sneak plummet out of from a grimy tunnel opening in the Keep walls and... SPLASH! Landing in the murky waters. Logan emerges, sputtering and coughing as Sneak tries to help him up. Logan shakes him off and stands.
C: 89 LOGAN 89
D: What the heck, bro?! What was that?!
C: 90 SNEAK 90
D: That was me saving your worthless hide.
C: 91 LOGAN 91
D: Yeah?! Well?! Thanks... Logan reaches down and plucks the hourglass out of the grime. Fixes it to his waist. Starts to get his bearings.
C: 92 SNEAK 92
D: Wake up already.
C: 93 LOGAN 93
D: I can’t.
C: 94 SNEAK 94
D: Whaddya mean? You’re free from the Nightmare King’s grasp. You know what I would give for that?!
C: 95 LOGAN 95
D: My friends are out there...
C: 96 SNEAK 96
D: Boss Man was right, Stinkbrain. You are a fool. But you ain’t weak, I’ll give you that. Thick as a brick. And cocky too, but not--
E: sighs
C: 97 LOGAN 97
D: Okay, okay...
C: 98 SNEAK 98
D: Well c’mon then. What, you think I’m hanging around this dump to see if his Royal Scariness notices you’re missing? Logan manages a grin. And we CUT TO --
E: off Logan’s skepticism
S: 11 EXT. GRIM REALM - DAY 11
N: Oz and the others wait at the edge of the canyon, looking out across the swamp that lies between them and the Shadowkeep. Zoey quietly joins them, out of breath...
C: 99 IZZIE 99
D: Did you find him?
C: 100 ZOEY 100
D: Maybe he woke up?
E: shakes her head
C: 101 MR. OZ 101
D: He knows there are too many bad dreams out here that could cross over if he did. We have to trust Mateo knows what he’s doing and stick to the plan.
E: beat
C: 102 IZZIE 102
D: You guys can stick to the plan. I’m going back for my brother!
C: 103 ZOEY 103
D: Don’t be ridiculous! You won’t make it out there on your own.
C: 104 IZZIE 104
D: Who said I’d be alone... Izzie reaches for her hourglass.
C: 105 MR. OZ 105
D: Isabel! Not again, we’ve already been through this-- But Izzie dreamcrafts Bunzai! Lighting up the gloom. The Dream Chasers hold their breath. Scanning the area.
C: 106 IZZIE 106
D: See it’s fine-- The sound of the Dark Archer’s signature TUNE echo out through the hills.
C: 107 ZOEY 107
D: No... 108 DARK ARCHER 108 I was waiting for you to do something foolish. You don’t disappoint, kid. THWIP! A SHADOW BOLT thuds into the ground next to Bunzai! He rears up, startled. The kids glance over to see -- THE DARK ARCHER standing atop a hill, his crossbow aimed. 109 DARK ARCHER 109 Throw down your hourglasses or the next one doesn’t miss... The kids shoot Oz a worried glance. Izzie grips her hourglass. 110 DARK ARCHER 110 Go ahead! I could use another one of your pets to experiment on...
E: O.S. CONT’D CONT’D
C: 111 IZZIE 111
D: You monster...
C: 112 COOPER 112
D: Zoey, use your clock...
E: whispers
C: 113 ZOEY 113
D: I can’t... I’m out of time.
E: hisses
C: 114 DARK ARCHER 114
D: I’m not going to ask again, Ozzie. Throw down your hourglasses!
N: Oz nods to the kids... then drops his hourglass. The kids reluctantly follow suit. Izzie is the last to do so, reducing Bunzai to plushie form and scooping him up protectively. 115 DARK ARCHER (CONT’D) 115 Take their weapons! Snivel and Susan burst out of the shadows, leading a small PACK OF SNARLING DARKLINGS out towards the Dream Chasers. The Darklings cackle and argue as they strip the Dream Chasers of their weapons. Oz trades an uneasy look with the kids.
S: 12 EXT. NIGHTMARE SWAMP - DAY 12
N: The surface of the muddy water is suddenly broken as Z Blob’s little eyes emerge... followed by the rest of him but -- He’s in the shape of an old diving helmet encasing Mateo’s head as the two emerge from the swamp like deep sea divers. They cautiously scan the area before Teo trudges to the craggy shore, removes the helmet, and Z pops into blob form.
C: 116 MATEO 116
D: Well, that could’ve gone better... Teo puts Z on his shoulder and climbs up the rocky hill. As he gets to the top, he suddenly flattens out on his belly. Mateo grabs Z Blob, quickly glancing around before dreamcrafting him into a PAIR OF BINOCULARS. Teo army crawls back to the top, looks out -- THROUGH THE BINOCULARS -- There’s the Dark Archer... and Teo’s friends being prodded towards the hulking form of a
C: GRIMHOLD...
D: 117 MATEO 117 Oh no... As his gaze drifts up the intimidating Grimhold -- SOMETHING BLOCKS HIS VIEW! Mateo drop the binoculars to see -- A DARKLING snarling in his face! He yelps as the monster grabs at him! Teo instictively wrestles the creature and they go tumbling back down to the edge of the swamp with a THUD! Mateo scrambles to his feet. Ready to fight and --
E: O.S. CONT’D
C: 118 LOGAN 118
D: Do you wanna get yourself caught?!
E: O.S.
N: Mateo glances over to see Logan scrambling towards him.
C: 119 MATEO 119
D: Logan?! Look out there’s-- Logan calmly reaches down and helps Sneak up.
C: 120 MATEO 120
D: Wait... what are you doing?
E: CONT’D
C: 121 LOGAN 121
D: Helping him up, what are you doing?
C: 122 MATEO 122
D: We were trying to rescue you... Sneak smiles. Trying to defuse the situation.
C: 123 SNEAK 123
D: That’s real sweet an all but--
C: 124 LOGAN 124
D: Bro, I’m not the one who needs rescuing. Clearly.
C: 125 MATEO 125
D: We wouldn’t even be out here if you hadn’t stolen the hourglass!
C: 126 LOGAN 126
D: I knew that’s what this was all about...
C: 127 MATEO 127
D: What? No... Logan forces a laugh. Shakes his head. Trades a look with Sneak who stops smiling - this reunion is going terribly.
C: 128 LOGAN 128
D: Guess your boss man was right about something. Logan unbuckles the hourglass and offers it out to Mateo.
C: 129 MATEO 129
D: Whatever... I don’t have time for this. Mateo takes the hourglass. Turns to leave. Logan stoic. Sneak glancing at both of them like WTF?!
C: 130 SNEAK 130
D: Wait, wait! Where are you going?
C: 131 MATEO 131
D: My friends are out there!
E: starts walking off
C: 132 SNEAK 132
D: That’s funny. This one here said the same thing earlier... Mateo hesitates.
C: 133 SNEAK 133
D: Shoulda’ woke up after he got outta the Shadowkeep. But ol Stinkbrain had to make sure you all were safe. Mateo turns back. Finally nods begrudgingly. Thrusts the hourglass back in Logan’s hands.
E: CONT’D
C: 134 MATEO 134
D: You’re gonna give this back to Mr. Oz. Logan takes the hourglass. Takes a deep breath. Nods.
C: 135 LOGAN 135
D: What’s your plan?
C: 136 MATEO 136
D: Honestly, I was just gonna charge in there like you would.
C: 137 LOGAN 137
D: Bro, you need a plan. C’mon. You’re the creative one...
C: 138 MATEO 138
D: Yeah well every time I dreamcraft out here, bad things happen.
C: 139 LOGAN 139
D: Welcome to my world...
C: 140 MATEO 140
D: So, what would you do?
C: 141 LOGAN 141
D: Psshht! Wait, are you really askin’ me? Well, I mean, how bad are we talking?
E: Mateo nods
C: 142 MATEO 142
D: You scared of spiders?
C: 143 SNEAK 143
D: Ha, who isn’t?
N: Mateo slowly turns to stare at Sneak... His gears turning.
C: 144 LOGAN 144
D: What are you thinking?
C: 145 MATEO 145
D: It’s a terrible idea...
C: 146 LOGAN 146
D: Yo... stop with that mess. Terrible or not, least you got something. Mateo nods.
C: 147 MATEO 147
D: Okay, check it out... As the three unlikely conspirators huddle up, we CUT TO --
S: 13 EXT. GRIM REALM - DARKLING CAMP - DAY 13
N: Scraggly nightmare trees surround a small darkling camp nestled in the gloomy hills. An unnatural campfire burns, shedding light on the -- The Dream Chasers’ hourglasses and weapons being tossed in a pile. ANGLE CHANGES TO REVEAL Oz and the Dream Chasers being prodded towards a towering GRIMHOLD and the open cage of his belly.

C: 151 MR. OZ 151 Plan B...
D: Okay, when I detonate this, get ready to make a break for it--
E: grunts
N: A CLUELESS DARKLING picks up Oz’s telescope blaster from the pile. Curiously pulls the trigger and BLAM! A blast harmlessly streaks into the sky -- Startling Oz! Who drops the Edison Bomb. The gang gasps, staring wide-eyed as it rolls unseen towards -- DARK ARCHER... Stepping over it as he snatches the blaster from Clueless Darkling, smacking him. Cackles of laughter burst out of the small squad of RAMBUNCTIOUS DARKLINGS as Archer tosses the blaster back on the pile and turns to Susan at his side --
C: 152 SUSAN 152
D: Not bad for a night’s work, eh boss?
C: 153 DARK ARCHER 153
D: Sneak and his loser friend will have no choice but to come running back now-- Archer marches off with Snivel and Susan in tow. No one noticed the Edison Bomb. Oz and the kids manage a smile of relief. They are marched closer to the Grimhold, Oz almost to where the bomb stopped rolling but -- Clueless Darkling picks it up... Begins to futz with the bomb, trying to figure out what it is. Oz groans with defeat.
C: 154 IZZIE 154
D: Got a plan C in that beard? Oz shoots Izzie an exhausted look. Clearly he doesn’t.
C: 155 COOPER 155
D: I’m not getting trapped in one of those things again... The Grimhold cage swings open. The Darkling guards prod the Dream Chasers forward... Grimhold’s claw reaching out... ANGLE ON The Dark Archer and Susan marching back to the Sharkface Airship moored nearby. Archer looks up in time to see -- SNEAK AND LO-LO bounding down the hillside towards them!
E: panicked

N: THE NIGHTMARE SPIDER rampaging into the camp... Darklings scatter in panic! Except for -- Clueless Darkling finally activates the Edison Bomb. It starts to BEEP a countdown. He looks at it curiously as -- MUNCH! The spider swallows him and the bomb whole. Turns its scary eyes towards the Dream Chasers... The gang screams! The Spider moves closer and -- WHAM! The Grimhold smacks it! The gang scrambles for cover as the two giants go at it. We can hear the loud countdown BEEP BEEP BEEPING from inside the spider’s belly. In the chaos, Oz and kids scramble back to the pile of their equipment, quickly scooping up their belongings. Zoey grabs her bow, turns to see -- LO-LO and SNEAK bounding towards them. Zoey takes aim and --
C: 157 MATEO 157 WAIT!
D: Mateo leaps in front of Lo-Lo. Hands in the air!
C: 158 ZOEY 158
D: Teo?!
C: 159 MATEO 159
D: That’s Logan! It’s Logan! Zoey stares at Lo-Lo, still aiming. Trying to process.
C: 160 LO-LO 160
D: What up girl... Izzie rushes up and hugs Teo. Then --
C: 161 IZZIE 161
D: Don’t you ever do something like that again, you big turkey!
C: 162 MATEO 162
D: Missed you too. Lo-Lo morphs back into Logan. Coop stares at him, mouth open.
C: 163 LOGAN 163
D: Bro, don’t even ask. Oz puts his hand on Logan’s shoulder. Logan hands him Luna’s hourglass.
C: 164 LOGAN 164
D: Mr. Oz, I’m --
E: CONT’D
C: 165 MR. OZ 165
D: I’m just glad you’re okay, son. BOOM! WHAM! ROAR! The kids glance over to see the Grimhold and spider still duking it out. Their fight taking them away from the camp. 166 MR. OZ 166 Save the reunion speeches! We’ve got to get back to the bridge door! One by one the Dream Chasers dreamcraft... working in unison... Izzie on Bunzai, Teo on Sir Z... Logan morphing into Lo-Lo as he leaps up and into... the truck Coop crafts.
E: CONT’D
C: 167 LO-LO 167
D: Drive it like you stole it! The Dark Archer tries to rally the few remaining Darklings. But Zoey picks off a few as Teo and Z Blob make a hole in their ranks. Snivel and Susan come gunning for Sneak but Coop roars up in his truck with Oz in the back, blasting away. Snivel and Susan dive for cover as Sneak leaps in. Zoey shoots one more look at Archer as she jumps in back and Coop’s truck takes off.
C: 168 DARK ARCHER 168
D: Stop them! Do not let them escape! Archer struggles to get Sharkface airborne as the last of his Darkling squad takes off on foot after the Dream Chasers.
S: 14 EXT. GRIM REALM - LATER 14
N: Oz and the Dream Chasers flee across the wasteland. Finally reaching the hillside rendezvous. Cooper’s truck sputters. He looks down at his hourglass.
C: 169 COOPER 169
D: I’m tapped! His truck starts to de-materialize... dumping the occupants. As the gang scrambles up the remainder of the hill, Bunzai reduces to a plushie...
C: 170 IZZIE 170
D: I’m out! They crest the hill... but Albert and the Bridge door are nowhere to be found.
C: 171 MR. OZ 171
D: Albert...
E: disappointed
C: 172 LOGAN 172

C: 173 IZZIE 173
D: Is it safe to wake up yet?
C: 174 MR. OZ 174
D: Definitely not. OZ’S ROCKET SHIP rises into view! The door opens. Albert lowers the ladder --
C: 175 ALBERT 175
D: Well what are you waiting for, a formal invitation?
S: 15 INT. OZ’S ROCKET SHIP - MOMENTS LATER 15
N: One by one, the gang scurries into the ship. Oz, the last in line as he climbs up. Albert sees Sneak crawl aboard. Shoots him a disgusted look --
C: 176 LOGAN 176
D: He’s rolling with me back to the landing. Any questions? Sneak struggles to hide his surprise. Clearly touched.
C: 177 ALBERT 177
D: Plenty, as a matter of fact, but -- The door slams shut.
C: 178 MR. OZ 178
D: Well. That was exciting, wasn’t it. BOOM! The door of the ship suddenly flies off! OUTSIDE -- The Sharkface airship looms, Oz’s ship door clutched in its grapplinghook like a souvenir. INSIDE -- Debris flies around the ship! Several of Oz’s things go tumbling out, including Oz and -- MATEO scrambles to the door, Z Blob on his shoulder, grabs Mr. Oz’s hand just as --
N: The hourglass flies out of the door along with more debris.
C: 179 MATEO 179
D: No! Mateo pulls Oz to safety. He lands in a heap inside the ship.
C: 180 MR. OZ 180
D: Albert! Get us out of here!
C: 181 LOGAN 181
D: Wait! The hourglass! Oz looks at Logan. Then smiles --
C: 182 MR. OZ 182
D: It’s okay. We got what we came here for, didn’t we? Logan fights back a surge of emotion. Then leaps out! Mateo and Sneak trade a look... then both leap out after!
S: 16 EXT. GRIM REALM - HILLTOP - MOMENTS LATER 16
N: Logan rushes towards the hourglass lying on the ground... Scrambling up to it as -- The remaining squad of Darklings encircles him. Sharkface hovering overhead. Archer’s laughter echoing out. Mateo and Sneak rush up!
C: 183 LOGAN 183
D: The heck are you guys thinking?!
C: 184 MATEO 184
D: Eh, what would Logan do?!
C: 185 SNEAK 185
D: What are friends for, Stinkbrain... The kids look to the Darklings, Logan morphs into Lo-Lo. The three friends bracing for a fight. Darklings snarl, drool, laugh maniacally. This is gonna get ugly. But then they stop as we hear -- BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The Darklings trade a confused look. A shadow falls over our heroes... everyone turns to see -- THE GIANT NIGHTMARE SPIDER cresting the hilltop. Madibles dripping with saliva... It rears up and --
N: BOOM! Just as Oz promised, an explosion of pure light radiates out from the spider, instantly evaporating the nightmare creatures... ANGLE ON OZ’S SHIP as the gang shields their eyes and -- ANGLE ON SHARKFACE - Archer, Snivel and Susan on deck as the ship banks away from the blast radius. BACK ON - Teo, Logan, and Z as they slowly open their eyes to find they are no longer surrounded. The spider and all the Darklings gone. Just particles of ether floating in the wind. Including Sneak... Logan’s eyes widen in realization.
C: 186 LOGAN 186

N: The Dream Chasers stand in front of the glass trophy case. Zoey takes a group shot of the team with the trophy displayed behind them. Logan has his hat in his hand.
C: 190 MATEO 190
D: Zoey, you sure you don’t want to be in the shot with us?
C: 191 IZZIE 191
D: Then there would be photographic evidence she participated. Can’t have that.
C: 192 ZOEY 192
D: Say sheeeeeep!
E: sarcastically
C: 193 COOPER 193
D: There. Now you can show your moms you’re so good, you can win even in your sleep.

C: 194 LOGAN 194

C: 195 IZZIE 195
D: Please. You’re part of our team.
C: 196 MATEO 196
D: And we’re all here now. That’s what counts, right? Logan looks down at his hat. Clearly missing his friend.
C: 197 LOGAN 197

S: 19 INT. SHADOWKEEP - CONTINUOUS 19
N: The Nightmare King stands in the spawning room, staff in hand as a DARKLING loads a canister of imagination into the machinery. Dark Archer sulks into the room. Realizes he’s looking at the Waking World projected from the staff.
C: 198 DARK ARCHER 198
D: You put an Eye on the Dream Chasers...
C: 199 NIGHTMARE KING 199
D: No thanks to you. I try to be patient, after everything you did to free me but--
E: sighs
C: 200 DARK ARCHER 200
D: I didn’t help the loser escape. It was that traitor Sneak! The Nightmare King spawns a Darkling. As it rises, we realize it is SNEAK... born anew from the dark machinery. Sneak collects himself. Realizing where he is and stepping protectively behind the Nightmare King.
C: 201 NIGHTMARE KING 201
D: This traitor? How do you think I got an Eye on the Dream Chasers in the first place? Archer takes in the scene. The Dream Chasers’ every move projects before the Nightmare King. Sneak watches, too. His expression especially glum. 202 NIGHTMARE KING 202 And you almost ruined it. Gimme one good reason why I shouldn’t banish you forever? Nightmare King stares at Archer. He panics. Then --
E: overcome by laughter CONT’D stops laughing
C: 203 DARK ARCHER 203
D: The little artiste’s green friend!
C: 204 NIGHTMARE KING 204
D: What?
C: 205 DARK ARCHER 205
D: He can cross over! I watched it happen! If that blob, that dream creature can cross over... Do you know what this means?! Nightmare King lowers his staff.

E: CONT’D
C: 207 NIGHTMARE KING 207
D: When I can take over the Waking World and show everyone a nightmare they’ll never forget. Nightmare King projects an image from his staff: Z Blob... now in his sights. As shadows darken the edge of our frame we CUT TO BLACK... END OF EPISODE
