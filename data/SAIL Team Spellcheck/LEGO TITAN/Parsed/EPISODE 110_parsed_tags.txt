N:     A bright sunny day in the city. STUDENTS scamper into the
N:     building. We hear the SQUELCH of a PA sytem. Then --
N: 1                       COACH JEFFREYS (O.S.)                    1
N:               It’s been an... interesting Sheep
N:               Week here at City Middle...

S: 2   INT. CITY MIDDLE - CAFETERIA STAGE - DAY                     2
N:     STUDENTS and TEACHERS gather around the cafeteria stage.
N:     Sheep Week regalia covers the walls. COACH JEFFREYS stands on
N:     stage, mic in hand, ready to hand out trophies that JADYN
N:     awkwardly prepares on a nearby table.
C: 2                       COACH JEFFREYS                           2
D:               But the team that defied
D:               expectation and overcame the odds
D:               to become this year’s champions...
D:     Jadyn attempts a drum roll on the table.
E: 3                       COACH JEFFREYS (CONT’D)                  3
D:               The Nobodies!
D:     Jadyn knocks over several of the trophies. There is a
D:     smattering of disinterested applause.
E: 4                       COACH JEFFREYS (CONT’D)                  4
E:                   (smile fading)
D:               Nobodies?
D:     DALLAS’S TEAM, THE WOLVES sullenly looks on as Coach, trophy
D:     in hand, scans the room. Makes eye contact with MS. PUTNAM
D:     who shrugs her shoulders. NOVA and several of her Nightmare
D:     Club cohorts look around, whisper conspiratorially.
E: 5                       COACH JEFFREYS (CONT’D)                  5
E:                   (growing distraught)
D:               What kind of team skips out on
D:               their own award?! How do you know
D:               you’re champions if you don’t have
D:               a trophy that says so?!
D:     Dallas reaches out to touch the 1ST PLACE TROPHY. Coach
D:     smacks his hand away.

N:     MATEO, IZZIE, COOPER and ZOEY gather in front of MR. OZ at
N:     his desk. He looks up from grading papers, confused.

D:                Guys... why aren’t you at the
D:                assembly?
D:      Mateo trades an uneasy look with his friends. Looks up
D:      solemnly to Mr. Oz --
C: 7                        MATEO                                        7
D:                Because it doesn’t mean anything
D:                without Logan...
D:      Oz stops grading. Concern washes over his face...
C: 8                         MR. OZ                                      8
D:                What do you mean?
E:                    (beat)
D:                Mateo, where is Logan?

N:      A Craggy, fog-shrouded marshland full of hills and caves,
N:      barren trees, and hopeless skies. In the distance, the
C:      ominous SHADOWKEEP looms...
D:      Oz and the kids emerge from the DREAM BRIDGE DOOR and behold
D:      the frightening vista.
C: 9                        IZZIE                                        9
D:                I still don’t get it, how did Logan
D:                end up here? What was he doing?
C: 10                       MR. OZ                                   10
D:                I suspect Luna’s Hourglass had
D:                something to do with it...
C: 11                          MATEO                                 11
D:                What?!
C: 12                       MR. OZ                                   12
D:                Someone took it from my office at
D:                the Night Bureau.
C: 13                       COOPER                                   13
D:                Dude... what was he thinking...
C: 14                       ZOEY                                     14
D:                He was probably feeling left out!
D:                You ever think about that when
D:                you’re running around dreamcrafting
D:                all the time?

D:                Wait, are you actually defending
D:                him? He totally stole that
D:                hourglass and now we gotta get it
D:                back before--
C: 16                       MR. OZ                                   16
D:                Okay, okay... Look, right now the
D:                most important thing is rescuing
D:                Logan before the Nightmare King
D:                knows we’re here.
D:      A piercing SHRIEK prompts everyone to look to the sky as they
D:      see a NIGHT TERROR patroling on the horizon...
C: 17                       ZOEY                                     17

D:                Wait, No! Izzie--
D:      Izzie whips out her hourglass, begins to dreamcraft... light
D:      from the swirling sand shining out like a lighthouse in the
D:      gloomy landscape as --
E: 20                       MR. OZ (CONT’D)                          20
D:                This place is so devoid of
D:                happiness and creativity, any
D:                display of imagination becomes a
D:                target!
D:      THE NIGHT TERROR suddenly banks hard, immediately zeroing in
D:      on Izzie as she crafts Bunzai...
D:      Uh oh... The kids scramble for cover by a NIGHTMARISH TREE as
D:      the Night Terror screams inbound!
C: 21                       COOPER                                   21
D:                Sooo... you’re saying we’re behind
D:                enemy lines and can’t dreamcraft?!
D:      Izzie grits her teeth, jumps onto Bunzai, hefting her weapon
D:      as the Night Terror shrieks towards them, claws out and --
D:      WHAM! Izzie and Bunzai leap up and take it out in one well
D:      placed blow! They land and she shoots Oz a cocky look --
D:      As she smiles, she doesn’t notice the nightmare tree behind
D:      her slowly reaching out, looming with its claw branches --
C: 22                       MATEO                                    22

N:      Bunzai freaks. Rears up, spilling Izzie to the ground as the
N:      tree reaches out and --
N:      BLAM! The nightmare tree gets obliterated. The kids turn to
N:      see Oz holding his telescope rifle. A stern look on his face.
C: 23                       MR. OZ                                23
D:                I’m saying make it count!
E:                    (composes himself)
D:                Look gang, it’s not just the
D:                Nightmare King’s forces we gotta
D:                worry about here. So we need to be
D:                disciplined and work together if
D:                we’re going to save Logan.
D:                Understood?
D:      The kids all trade a fearful look.
C: 24                       ALBERT                                24
D:                Do try and hurry. I will keep the
D:                bridge door open as long as I can.
D:                But just in case...
D:      Albert gives Oz a small shiny metal ball contraption.
C: 25                       COOPER                                25

D:                We all get new toys for this
D:                mission?
C: 26                       ALBERT                                26
E:                    (hands it back to Oz)
D:                Young man, the Edison Bomb is not a
D:                toy, it’s a failsafe.
C: 27                       MR. OZ                                27
E:                    (off Coop’s confusion)
D:                Plan B. When it detonates, it emits
D:                pure daylight. Bad news for any
D:                nightmare creatures in its radius.
C: 28                       IZZIE                                 28

D:                Okay, alright... Storming the
D:                Shadowkeep! We can do this! What’s
D:                the plan? You’ve been in there,
D:                right Mr. Oz?
C: 29                       MR. OZ                                29

D:                Whu-- You don’t just stroll into
D:                the Shadowkeep! We’re not on a
D:                field trip to a museum - this whole
D:                place is basically a wasteland of
D:                fears, phobias, and regret...

D:      Mateo points in the distance: a small PATROL OF DARKLINGS on

D:      The gang darts off towards the Darklings in the distance. We

N:      SNEAK, SNIVEL, and SUSAN escort LOGAN through a dank, twisty
N:      tunnel. Coming to a stop outside the doors to the FEAR WORKS.
N:      DARK ARCHER stands with them, nursing his backside, shooting
N:      an accusing glare at the spear Sneak is holding.

D:                watch where you point that thing!

D:      Archer shoots them a look. They button it up. He sighs.

D:                stop being both, kid.
D:      The door swings open. Logan’s eyes go wide: There before him
D:      is a room full of CONTAINMENT UNITS - dreaming KIDS in each
D:      one, their imaginations being siphoned out and funneled away
D:      by horrendous machinery.

D:                stop the Nightmare King.
D:      Archer locks eyes with Logan. Logan flinches. Dark Archer
D:      laughs. The gravity of the situation slams home with Logan.

D:                friends aren’t coming because they

D:      Logan looks up at the Dark Archer, clearly wounded.

D:                Little bit of advice: choose better
D:                friends.
D:      Archer laughs as he turns and walks back down the hall.
D:      Snivel turns to the other two.
C: 44                       SNIVEL                                   44
D:                Ssooo, who gets the honors?
D:      Sneak shoves Logan into the unit. The door CLANGS shut. He
D:      goes to lock it but fumbles with the keys, dropping them.
D:      Snivel growls, motions to Susan who barrels forwards and
D:      WHAM! Knocks Sneak to the ground. She looms over his limp
D:      body and picks up the keys.

D:                You’re just as weak and pathetic as
D:                this loser here --
D:      Snivel turns and realizes the containment unit is empty.
D:      Logan is missing! He casts a panicked look around and sees --
D:      LO-LO, in full blue gremlin mode, swing off the top of the
D:      unit and --
D:      SLAM! Two feet right to Snivel’s face, sends him to the
D:      ground. Susan ROARS and CHARGES toward Lo-Lo like a freight
D:      train but --
D:      LO-LO jumps up, grabbing the containment unit cage and
D:      swinging out of the way as SUSAN rams into the nearby wall -
D:      slumping to the ground, out like a light.
D:      Lo-Lo lands back on the ground chest heaving, and stares down

D:                Who’s the loser now...
D:      He hears the sound of metal on stone and his eyes glance up
D:      to find --
D:      SNEAK standing in front of the exit, spear in hand. Lo-Lo
D:      locks eyes with Sneak... And Sneak lowers the spear.
D:      Lo-Lo slowly transitions back into Logan.

N:      A SWARM of NIGHT TERRORS snakes down the hall and flitters up

C:      with LUNA’S HOURGLASS.
D:      Dark Archer howls in frustration. SUSAN scurries down the

D:      immediately starts pounding on the chest to no avail. He
D:      turns his angry little eyes to Sneak...
D:      Who fishes around under the worktable... and produces a

N:      It’s an epic swashbuckling fight up the craggy Grim Realm
N:      hills -- Z and Teo working in tandem to fight and deflect as
N:      the giant spider pursues them.
N:      Teo and Z crest the hill to see a nightmarish SWAMP laid out
N:      before them. Mateo glances back in time to see --
N:      THWUMP! A glob of webbing shoot out, snagging Z who falls to
N:      the ground. Teo doubles back, tugging and hacking to try and
N:      free his friend as the SPIDER scurries towards them and --
N:      SNAP! Z is free! But the momentum carries them backwards --
N:      TUMBLING down the hill! The fall reduces Z back into blob
N:      form, rolling off the hill and they --
N:      SPLASH! Disappear into the foggy waters of the swamp...
N:      The giant spider scuttles up to the crest. Eyes scanning the

N:      WHOOSH! Logan and Sneak plummet out of from a grimy tunnel
N:      opening in the Keep walls and...
N:      SPLASH! Landing in the murky waters. Logan emerges,

N:       Scrambling up to it as --
N:       The remaining squad of Darklings encircles him. Sharkface
N:       hovering overhead. Archer’s laughter echoing out.
N:       Mateo and Sneak rush up!
C: 183                       LOGAN                                   183
D:                 The heck are you guys thinking?!

D:                 What are friends for, Stinkbrain...
D:       The kids look to the Darklings, Logan morphs into Lo-Lo. The
D:       three friends bracing for a fight.
D:       Darklings snarl, drool, laugh maniacally. This is gonna get
D:       ugly. But then they stop as we hear --
D:       BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The Darklings trade a confused look.
D:       A shadow falls over our heroes... everyone turns to see --
D:       THE GIANT NIGHTMARE SPIDER cresting the hilltop. Madibles
D:       dripping with saliva... It rears up and --

N:       BOOM! Just as Oz promised, an explosion of pure light
N:       radiates out from the spider, instantly evaporating the
N:       nightmare creatures...
N:       ANGLE ON OZ’S SHIP as the gang shields their eyes and --
N:       ANGLE ON SHARKFACE - Archer, Snivel and Susan on deck as the
N:       ship banks away from the blast radius.
N:       BACK ON - Teo, Logan, and Z as they slowly open their eyes to
N:       find they are no longer surrounded. The spider and all the
N:       Darklings gone. Just particles of ether floating in the wind.
N:       Including Sneak... Logan’s eyes widen in realization.
C: 186                       LOGAN                                   186
D:                 No...
D:       Logan finds something on the ground... the hat he gave Sneak.

D:                 No!
D:       Several shadow bolts THUD into the ground.

E:                     (picking up the hourglass)

N:       The Dream Chasers stand in front of the glass trophy case.
N:       Zoey takes a group shot of the team with the trophy displayed
N:       behind them. Logan has his hat in his hand.

N:       The Nightmare King stands in the spawning room, staff in hand
N:       as a DARKLING loads a canister of imagination into the
N:       machinery.
N:       Dark Archer sulks into the room. Realizes he’s looking at the
N:       Waking World projected from the staff.

D:                 was that traitor Sneak!
D:       The Nightmare King spawns a Darkling. As it rises, we realize
D:       it is SNEAK... born anew from the dark machinery. Sneak
D:       collects himself. Realizing where he is and stepping
D:       protectively behind the Nightmare King.

D:       Archer takes in the scene. The Dream Chasers’ every move

D:                 know what this means?!
D:       Nightmare King lowers his staff. Sneak looks from one villain
D:       to the other. Wondering what does this mean?!
E: 206                       DARK ARCHER (CONT’D)                 206
