S: INT. SHADOWKEEP - THRONE ROOM - DAY
N: The NIGHTMARE KING gazes through the headpiece of his staff... spying on LOGAN and the DREAM CHASERS through the hat as SNEAK, SNIVEL and SUSAN bicker in the background.
C: 1 NIGHTMARE KING 1
D: Quiet, you fools! I’m trying to hear what the Dream Chasers’ next move is... The Nightmare King peers closer. We ZOOM IN ON THE POV --
S: INT. CITY MIDDLE - CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS
N: 2 MS. PUTNAM (O.S.) 2 Next! LOGAN takes the stage in the cafeteria. A banner decorated with Halloween imagery behind him reads - FALL
C: CARNIVAL AUDITIONS.
D: MS. PUTNAM, the LIBRARIAN, and COACH JEFFREYS stand expectantly with clipboards in hand. When Coach looks up to see Logan, he smirks.
C: 3 COACH JEFFREYS 3
D: Time out... you’re auditioning for the carnival main stage?!
C: 4 LOGAN 4
D: Can’t have a block party without some sick beats, Coach... Now, get ready to have your faces melted by the musical mastery of DJ LOGANATOR! Logan picks up the microphone. Hits play on his phone -- CROSS CUT THE SHADOWKEEP -- Teeth-clenching EDM beats BOOM out of the Nightmare King’s staff! We hear Logan improvising lyrics and noises... The Nightmare King painfully grabs his ears! SNEAK, SNIVEL and SUSAN can't help but dance a little as we --
E: plugs in his phone
S: INT. CITY MIDDLE - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Logan’s “music” THUDS out from behind the closed cafeteria doors. WIDEN OUT TO REVEAL -- Mateo and Cooper exchanging skeptical looks as they wait in the hall.
C: 5 COOPER 5
D: Hey man, everyone’s gotta have dreams...
E: shrugs
N: A LOCKER SLAM causes Mateo to glance over and see ZOEY hastily gathering her books.
C: 6 MATEO 6
D: You gonna audition?
C: 7 ZOEY 7
D: Do I look like someone who auditions?
C: 8 IZZIE 8
D: You look like someone who-- Zoey pivots to glare at Izzie as she comes bounding up.
E: O.S.
C: 9 ZOEY 9
D: Don’t. Izzie’s mouth hangs open. She WANTS to continue that thought. The look on Zoey’s face convinces her otherwise. Logan bursts out of the cafeteria door.
C: 10 LOGAN 10
D: Totally nailed it. Coach Jeffreys emerges right after. Still wincing and rubbing his ears.
C: 11 COACH JEFFREYS 11
D: I wouldn’t hold your breath, champ. Anybody else wanna audition? Mateo glares at Zoey. She shakes her head.
E: looks to the others
C: 12 ZOEY 12
D: Look, just because some people want to share their dreams with the world, doesn’t mean everyone wants to. You of all people should know... As Mateo watches Zoey head out, he catches sight of his own comic artwork adorning the CARNIVAL POSTERS. Coach Jeffreys shrugs. Heads back inside the cafeteria.
C: 13 LOGAN 13
D: Don’t sweat it guys. I’ll practice my skills tonight. Show Coach I can DJ with the best of them. 14 MR. OZ 14 No time for extracurricular shenanigans, gang... The kids turn to see Oz arrive in a bluster. Arms full of papers.
E: O.S.
N: 15 MR. OZ (CONT’D) 15 Tonight we’re finally tracking down the Sandman... Meet me at the Landing, and don’t be late! I’ll explain everything... As Oz shuffles off, the kids turn to each other. Logan looks bummed.
C: 16 LOGAN 16
D: You guys ever think about going back to having normal dreams? Like, just being a regular kid again?
C: 17 COOPER 17
D: What, and forget about being Dream Chasers?
C: 18 MATEO 18
D: Look, we just gotta fix the hourglass and put a stop to the Nightmare King. We’re so close! Now that Mr. Oz knows where the Sandman is, I bet it’s gonna be smooth sailing from here on out... Mateo smiles reassuringly as we SMASH CUT TO --
S: INT. OZ’S SHIP (DREAM WORLD) - DAY
N: ALARM BELLS WAIL! Sparks fly. OZ and ALBERT man the controls, blasting away at the -- SHARKFACE AIRSHIP pursuing them as NIGHT TERRORS streak out towards the ship... IN THE CABIN -- MATEO, IZZIE, COOP, LOGAN and ZOEY brace themselves.
C: 19 IZZIE 19
D: Is this your idea of smooth sailing?!
C: 20 MATEO 20
D: How did they find us so quickly?! We see the HAT on Logan’s head. He YELPS as Albert punches the thrusters... Diving...
C: 21 ALBERT 21
D: Hang on!
C: 22 LOGAN 22
D: Bro, where the heck are we headed?!
C: 23 MR. OZ 23
D: The Murky Realm!
C: 24 ZOEY 24
D: The where?! The ship shudders as Oz blasts a few more Night Terrors.
C: 25 MR. OZ 25
D: With Zoey’s help, I was able to decipher the musical clue from our dearly departed friend Jim the Yeti. I realized it was a SIREN SONG... only sung by the fabled sirens of the Murky Realm. It must be the location of the Sandman’s Tower! AHEAD -- the kids see the vibrant edges of the Dream World disappear in a pea soup-like fog.
C: 26 ALBERT 26
D: Good god man! Stop yammering and keep shooting! We’re surrounded! BOOM! The control panel sparks! The ship lurches! The gang SCREAMS! Logan grabs Izzie's hand. Realizes what he did. Screams again!
C: 27 MR. OZ 27
D: Too late! Brace yourselves! Mateo trades a worried look with his friends as the ship plummets and we CUT TO --
S: INT/EXT. SHARKFACE AIRSHIP - SAME
N: The unruly crew of NIGHTLINGS scramble about under the watchful eye of the NIGHT HUNTER.
C: 28 NIGHT HUNTER 28
D: C’mon you pathetic excuses for bad dreams! We’ve almost got them now! ON THE MAIN DECK -- The NIGHTMARE KING grips the railing. Peers out... His expression darkening.
C: 29 NIGHTMARE KING 29
D: Stop...
E: louder
C: STOP I said! Unruly CREW hesitates. 30 NIGHT HUNTER 30
D: Well come on then! You heard his Royal Scariness! Full stop! The crew scrambles over themselves to stop the ship as the Hunter approaches the Nightmare King.
N: 31 NIGHT HUNTER (CONT’D) 31 Why are we stopping? The Nightmare King points... we see the fog of the Murky Realm ahead...
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - DAY
N: Oz’s ship plows through the murky atmosphere. Little floating islands emerging out of the fog... the ship barely avoiding them... engine cutting out before finally sputtering to a rough landing atop a swampy little island amidst an endless expanse of opaque grey...
S: INT. OZ’S SHIP - MOMENTS LATER
N: Dazed and shaken, the kids peer fearfully out at the foggy ether surrounding the ship.
C: 32 MATEO 32
D: Everyone okay?
C: A few uneasy nods. 33 COOPER 33
D: What are we supposed to do now? Albert enters the cabin from the rear compartment, coughing, wafting smoke away, covered in oil.
C: 34 ALBERT 34
D: Engines are spent, wing has been torn to pieces... hate to break it to y’all but we’re not doing anything til those get repaired.
C: 35 LOGAN 35
D: Got any more bad news? Oz turns from the instrument panel to face the kids.
E: sarcastic
C: 36 MR. OZ 36
D: The Nightmare King didn’t follow us...
C: 37 ZOEY 37
D: Uhhh, that sounds like good news. What am
C: I missing here? 38 ALBERT 38
D: Young lady, legend has it the Murky Realm is where everything is forgotten and dreams go to die. So...
C: 39 MATEO 39
D: If the Nightmare King didn’t follow us, the legends must be true.
C: 40 IZZIE 40
D: Awesome...
E: sarcastic
C: 41 MR. OZ 41
D: Being forgotten is the one thing he fears... It’s a perfect place to hide really. Look... Oz points out the cockpit window... IN THE DISTANCE: The Sandman's tower. A rocky island reefed in fog, dunes of Dream Sand cascade off. The tower sits atop. A shining beacon in the gloom. 42 MR. OZ 42 Our best bet is to fix the ship and get to the tower before the Murky Realm exacts its inevitable toll and we begin to forget the very things that make us who we are... Oz turns to the kids and puts on a smile. 43 MR. OZ 43 Now, who wants to get out there and help with the repairs?
E: realizing then CONT’D CONT’D
S: EXT. SHARKFACE AIRSHIP - DAY
N: The Nightmare King turns from the railing of the ship as the Night Hunter approaches.
C: 44 NIGHTMARE KING 44
D: Do you know what lurks in there?
C: 45 NIGHT HUNTER 45
D: I’ve-- I’ve heard the stories, Your Ghastliness... what would you like to do? The Nightmare King struggles to contain a manic fit of laughter.
C: 46 NIGHTMARE KING 46
D: What would I like to-- I’d like to cross into the Waking World! But I can’t because the Boy and his Blob have disappeared into the Murky Realm!
E: grows sinister MORE
C: NIGHTMARE KING
D: My plans are now in jeopardy... Unless you find the Blob and bring him to me. Understood? The Night Hunter gazes out at the Murky Realm...
E: CONT'D
S: INT/EXT. OZ’S SHIP - MURKY REALM - LATER
N: Cooper tinkers with the damaged control panel while Logan grooves nearby, phone in hand, music blaring out... Mr. Oz storms out of the rear compartment.
C: 47 MR. OZ 47
D: Logan!! I’m trying to work here... Logan sulks. Pulls out his headphones and puts them on. Silencing the annoying music. Oz turns to help Cooper with the panel. Oz pauses his work, cocks his head -- 48 MR. OZ 48 Logan! I said turn off that-- Oz glares at Logan... who still has his headphones on. Rocking out. Totally oblivious. 49 MR. OZ 49 --music... Cooper notices too. Strains to listen... we hear a BEWITCHING MELODY echo out and CUT TO -- OUTSIDE ON THE WING -- Albert works on repairing the damaged wing. He looks up to see Mateo, Z Blob, Izzie and Zoey gathered on the edge, looking out at the fog beyond...
E: CONT’D CONT’D
C: 50 IZZIE 50
D: It’s so... Murky.
C: 51 ALBERT 51
D: No telling what’s out there so watch where you step - I don’t have time to babysit.
C: 52 ZOEY 52
D: Then what are we doing out here?
C: 53 ALBERT 53
D: You’re supposed to be helping. Mateo, give me a wrench. Mateo backs away from the edge. Turns to Albert.
C: 54 MATEO 54 I... don’t have one.
D: Albert frowns.
C: 55 ALBERT 55
D: Son, you’re a dang dreamcrafter.
C: 56 MATEO 56
D: Right... Mateo reaches for his hourglass. Hesitates. Smile fading.
E: chuckles
C: 57 IZZIE 57
D: What’s up brosephus?
C: 58 MATEO 58
D: I-- I can’t remember how to dreamcraft... Albert looks up from his work. Sees Mateo gazing out into the foggy ether. Albert's expression grows dark...
C: 59 ALBERT 59
D: The effects of the Murky Realm are taking hold... We need to hurry!
C: 60 ZOEY 60
D: Albert, relax man. Just listen... Albert shoots a worried look over to -- ZOEY AND IZZIE... gazing out into the fog. A far away look in their eyes as they strain to listen and we -- CUT TO THE COCKPIT -- Logan, totally clueless as he jams out. Doesn't see -- Coop and Oz drift to the door of the ship, totally transfixed. As they converge at the door, we SEE OMINOUS SHAPES dart past in the fog outside...
C: 61 COOPER 61
D: What are they?
C: 62 MR. OZ 62
D: I read about this, but now I... I can’t remember... Cooper opens the door to the ship, revealing -- A MERMAID-LIKE CREATURE “swimming” in the fog and beckoning for them to follow. This is a SIREN. CROSS CUT TO THE WING -- As Mateo and Z Blob drift closer to the edge of the wing, transfixed by the same serene melody...
N: Albert springs up and bounds across, but gets his foot stuck in a hole in the wing! He yells in frustration.
C: 63 ALBERT 63
D: Mateo! BACK IN THE COCKPIT -- Logan finally looks up to see Oz and Coop about to follow the siren into the fog. He yanks off his headphones --
C: 64 LOGAN 64
D: Yo! Where do you think you’re-- But the siren song reaches his ears. Instantly transfixing him too. Logan drifts towards the door... headphone wire going taught... finally unplugging from the phone on his seat and -- ANNOYING EDM BLARES OUT!! Overpowering the siren song. Startling everyone back to their senses. Oz and Coop immediately halt. BACK ON THE WING -- The EDM beats echo out... shattering the serene vibes. Everyone snaps out of their daze. Izzie shoots a look to Mateo and Z Blob but -- They are teetering on the edge, about to fall and... Mateo steadies himself! Looks down into the fog to see the beautiful siren... which suddenly -- LEAPS UP out of the fog AND SNATCHES Z BLOB!
C: 65 MATEO 65
D: Zeeee! Mateo doesn’t hesitate. Leaps into the fog, disappearing in the murk.
C: 66 IZZIE 66
D: We gotta go after my brother! Izzie pulls out her Bunchu plushie. Prepares to dreamcraft. But the determined look on her face vanishes.
C: 67 ALBERT 67
D: You all are forgetting. Forgetting what makes you Dream Chasers... Zoey grumbles. Then pushes past a stunned Izzie and dives into the fog after Mateo as we CUT TO --
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - FOG - DAY
N: Mateo leaps from one rocky island to another, enveloped in a dense fog. Desperately scanning the scraggly trees that loom up out of the murk like ghosts.
C: 68 MATEO 68
D: Zeee?! Z BLOB WHERE ARE YOU? He hears a strange SUCKING sound. Teo rushes past a stand of swamp trees to find -- A CLEARING... And as the fog parts, he discovers a SIREN hunched over Z Blob... IT’S FEEDING ON HIM...
C: 69 MATEO 69
D: Hey! Get your hands off my-- But when the siren turns to face him, Mateo sees it has transformed into a HIDEOUS MONSTER with fangs and claws. Gulp... Mateo hesitates... then sees several OTHER HIDEOUS SIRENS emerge from the fog... surrounding him. Mateo stands his ground. Fear etched across his face... The Sirens poised to attack and -- TIME SLOWS... and begins to rewind as ZOEY streaks through the murk, grabbing Mateo and Z Blob... TIME RESUMES... the sirens about to pounce, but Mateo and Z Blob are standing safely with Zoey.
E: CONT’D
C: 70 MATEO 70
D: What do we do now? The sirens hiss at the kids! And begin to dart forward!
E: CONT’D
C: 71 ZOEY 71
D: Fight... FFWIIP! FFWIIP! Arrows streak through the fog. Taking out a few Sirens. Zoey’s skill on full display. Making the Sirens think twice. But she quickly runs out of arrows... The Sirens begin to rally... their BEWITCHING SONG filling the air. Mateo reaches for his hourglass. Fights the effects of the song. A daze creeping over him....
E: unslings her bow
C: 72 MATEO 72
D: We... we gotta do something to overpower the siren song... Zoey...
C: 73 ZOEY 73
D: I can’t...
C: 74 MATEO 74
D: Now’s not the time to be shy about your music! You gotta play something loud!
C: 75 ZOEY 75
D: No, I mean I can’t remember how!
S: EXT. OZ’S SHIP - MURKY REALM
N: Oz gathers the other kids with Albert at the wing as they survey the fog. Logan’s music echoes out from his phone.
C: 76 ALBERT 76
D: Do we have to listen to that infernal racket?!
C: 77 MR. OZ 77
D: That infernal racket might be the one thing dispelling the siren song.
C: 78 LOGAN 78
D: Oh snap! See, Mr. Oz knows a banger when he hears one.
C: 79 MR. OZ 79
D: Albert, can you repair the ship on your own? Albert glances down to see the SHIP IS SLOWLY SINKING
C: INTO THE MURK... 80 ALBERT 80
D: Logan’s music may be able to hold off the Sirens, but it won’t delay the effects of the Murky Realm. If we don’t get out of here, there may not be a ship to repair.
C: 81 IZZIE 81
D: Then what the heck are we waiting for?! Let’s go! Oz nods solemnly at Albert. The gang prepares to disperse. Logan hands Albert his phone.
C: 82 ALBERT 82
D: Young man, I couldn’t-- wouldn’t want to deprive you of your, ah, sick beats. Logan whips out an old school BOOMBOX covered in stickers.
C: 83 LOGAN 83
D: S’all good bro. I always bring back up. It’s a DJ’s sworn duty to make sure the party don’t stop.
E: MORE
C: LOGAN
D: Now, while we’re gone, you can listen to my hottest new track - Infernal Racket! Logan hits play. Leaves Albert grimacing as the group heads out, music blasting out of the boombox.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - DAY
N: Mateo, Z Blob and Zoey flee blindly through the fog, leaping to a mist-shrouded island dotted with strange trees. He glances at Zoey who has a look of panic on her face.
C: 84 MATEO 84
D: It’s gonna be okay, we’ll find Oz’s ship--
C: 85 ZOEY 85
D: Teo, I’ve forgotten how to play! I’ve forgotten the thing that makes me, me...
C: 86 MATEO 86
D: Look, I know how much music means to you but right now--
C: 87 ZOEY 87
D: It’s not just about the music! You don’t understand...
C: 88 MATEO 88
D: I’m trying! But you don’t share anything with anybody! You don’t let anyone get close enough to understand-- 89 OLD BLIND LADY 89
E: O.S.
C: I understand, child...
D: Zoey and Mateo pivot to see a LITTLE OLD BLIND LADY waddle out of the mist, carrying a lantern and cane. A hooded cloak casts her features in shadow.
C: 90 MATEO 90
D: Stay back! Who are you?! 91 OLD BLIND LADY 91 Someone who can help... Come, quickly before the sirens get you. Or worse... Mateo trades a look with Z Blob. He shakes his little blob body. Doesn’t like the look of this new arrival.
C: 92 MATEO 92
D: Uhhh, no thanks lady. I think we’ll be going--
N: 93 OLD BLIND LADY 93 Suit yourselves. But when you forget all the little pieces of yourself, don’t come crying to me. She turns and waddles off into the mist. The glow of her lantern receding in the murk. Zoey trades a look with Mateo and turns to follow. Teo grabs her.
C: 94 MATEO 94
D: What are you doing? We’ve got to get back to the ship!
C: 95 ZOEY 95
D: The Hunter took the song my mom used to sing to me and twisted it. Just to taunt me. The only thing I have left of her now is a dream where she... Teo, I can feel myself forgetting that dream. I’m forgetting how to play. I’m forgetting all the little pieces of me. She looks at the retreating form of the Old Lady.
E: beat
C: 96 ZOEY 96
D: I’m not gonna let that happen. She heads into the murk. Mateo grapples with a decision. Glances back to see the ghostly forms of the SIRENS beginning to close in... and then chases after Zoey. As the Sirens converge and continue their pursuit -- FFWIIP! FFWIIP! They are cut down in a hail of crossbow bolts... THE NIGHT HUNTER swoops down from one of the trees. He walks forward, scanning the murk. Then pauses... ON THE GROUND - a ring of DREAM RUNES, carved into stones, borders the mysterious island...
E: CONT’D
S: EXT. SHARKFACE AIRSHIP - DAY
N: The Nightmare King gazes at the runes through his staff... Susan approaches.
C: 97 SUSAN 97
D: The Hunter hesitates...
C: 98 NIGHTMARE KING 98
D: He is being cautious...
C: 99 SUSAN 99
D: Because he is weak. He gazes through the staff again...
C: 100 NIGHTMARE KING 100
D: Because there’s something worse than forgetting your dreams: Getting trapped in them... We linger on the image of the Dream Runes as we FADE TO --
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - LATER
N: We’re CLOSE ON the dream runes... WIDEN OUT TO REVEAL -- OZ and the others emerging from the murk to stand before runes. Coop bends down to examine them.
C: 101 COOPER 101
D: Is this a warning? To keep people out?
C: 102 MR. OZ 102
D: I think this is here to keep something in. Logan sets the boombox down. Wipes a glob of Z Blob goo from the ground.
C: 103 LOGAN 103
D: Yo, they definitely came this way... Izzie bravely steps forward.
C: 104 IZZIE 104
D: Then let’s get this show on the road.
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - DAY
N: Zoey chases after the bobbing light from the Old Woman’s lantern as it retreats through the mists.
C: 105 MATEO 105
D: Zoey! Wait! She glances around the murky landscape, lost in the fog. Just silhouettes of scraggly trees around her. Then she hears it... the faint sound of a GUITAR... Zoey strains to listen... eyes going wide with recognition! Zoey takes off in the direction of the music. MOMENTS LATER -- Mateo and Z stumble through. No sign of Zoey...
E: O.S.
C: 106 MATEO 106
D: What do you think bud, where’d she go? Z Blob gestures... Mateo catches a glimpse of a light bobbing through the distant fog.
E: CONT’D to Z on his shoulder
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - WITCH’S CAMP - DAY
N: Mateo stumbles through the fog and scraggly trees, emerging into a clearing where he finds a small fire burning... an iron cooking pot bubbling... And built into the surrounding trees, shelves upon shelves crammed with GLASS JARS AND BAUBLES... each one radiating with misty energy. 107 OLD BLIND LADY (O.S.) 107 Glad you decided to join me... Mateo pivots to find the Old Lady standing near the fire. Her hood comes off. He can finally see that she is blind. 108 OLD BLIND LADY (CONT’D) 108 I’m stuck on this island because of my... condition. So I don’t see many visitors.
C: 109 MATEO 109
D: Wait... you’re blind... 110 OLD BLIND LADY 110 I still have ways to see what I want...
C: 111 MATEO 111
D: What did you do with my friend? Where’s Zoey? Mateo’s eyes keep darting to the radiant jars in the shelves all over the camp. 112 OLD BLIND LADY 112 Come, look for yourself...
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - DAY
N: Zoey follows the sound of the GUITAR echoing through the mist... emerging from the fog to find another small clearing. A dead end. Nothing here.
C: 113 ZOEY 113
D: Where is that music coming from... She turns to double back, only to see THE HUNTER emerge from the fog and into the clearing. Tracking her.
C: 114 NIGHT HUNTER 114
D: You and your music... Her eyes narrow... doesn’t say anything. Just howls with anger and charges forward... Fighting the Hunter... manipulating time... battle raging all over the clearing. Even without her arrows, Zoey’s a force to be reckoned with. But the Hunter is better... He finally gets the upper hand. Has her dead to rights, crossbow aimed...
C: 115 ZOEY 115
D: Go ahead... what else are you gonna take from me?
C: 116 NIGHT HUNTER 116
D: That’s the thing with your generation: Thinking everything’s always about you. He lowers his crossbow. 117 NIGHT HUNTER 117 I got news for you kid, I’m not here for you... Hunter leaves Zoey on the ground. Retreats into the fog. She growls. Springs up and is about to chase after when the little clearing ALIGHTS WITH A STRANGE GLOW... The sound of GUITAR grows louder. Zoey spins to see the clearing take on the murky appearance of a -- PARK -- A hazy scene materializes before her eyes: a YOUNG MOTHER sits in the grass, playing guitar to a
E: CONT’D
C: CHILD... Zoey’s jaw drops... 118 ZOEY 118
D: Mom? Zoey steps forward into the ghostly fog-shrouded dream...
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - WITCH’S CAMP - SAME
N: ... as the Old Woman plucks a JAR from a shelf and it ALIGHTS WITH ZOEY’S DREAM INSIDE... Mateo gawks at it. Fascinated. Hears the melody faintly echo out.
C: 119 MATEO 119
D: Is that... Where did this come from? 120 OLD BLIND LADY 120 Oh, let’s just say forgotten dreams have a way of winding up here... Look --
N: The fog around Mateo swirls, taking on the appearance of-- MATEO’S LIVING ROOM -- Faint and hazy... but Mateo immediately becomes transfixed by the sight of an ART SET and EASEL with a birthday bow on top and a YOUNGER
C: MATEO...
D: A festive banner reads: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MIJO. Mateo steps forward into the dreamy scene, merging with the younger version of himself.
C: 121 MATEO 121
D: I remember this... this was my first art set. This was the first time I drew-- We watch Mateo draw a crude little Z BLOB... The real Z Blob grunts. Trying to get Mateo’s attention. Mateo just smiles serenely. Lost in the experience.
C: 122 MATEO 122
D: Why are you hoarding these dreams? 123 OLD BLIND LADY 123 Hoarding them? Goodness no, I’m protecting them! I prevent them from being forgotten by making them nostalgic. Comforting, even. Now you can revisit these memory dreams, time and time again... You’ll see why... Z Blob grows worried as Mateo falls under the spell of nostalgia.
E: CONT’D
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND
N: Izzie bounds through the fog. Catches sight of a fleeting light.
C: 124 IZZIE 124
D: Guys! I see something ahead-- She jogs forward, only to see the swirling fog begin to transform into -- MATEO AND IZZIE’S BEDROOM -- Just impressions really... Hazy and faint, but Izzie immediately recognizes it.
E: calling out
C: 125 IZZIE 125
D: My room...? On her bed is a plushie with a bow on it and a note.
E: CONT’D
C: 126 IZZIE 126
D: Mr. SharkyJaw! She rushes over to it. Picks up the note.
E: CONT’D
C: 127 IZZIE 127
D: OHMIGAW, I remember this... my mom got me SharkyJaw before my first dentist appointment. Because she couldn’t go with me. Every time I lost a baby tooth I put it inside... Guys. This is a memory dream... She turns around but Oz, Logan and Cooper are not behind her. Just more disorienting fog.
E: CONT’D realizing something
C: 128 IZZIE 128
D: Guys? She turns back to her memory dream and her expression darkens... THERE’S A SHADOWY FIGURE IN THE CORNER.
E: CONT’D
C: 129 IZZIE 129
D: Mom... 130 MYSTERIOUS WOMAN 130 Do you like your present, Izzie? I’m sorry I couldn’t be there... The figure comes forward... a young MYSTERIOUS WOMAN. But there’s something unsettling about her. 131 MYSTERIOUS WOMAN 131 But you can revisit this moment whenever you like. I promise I’ll always be here now... Izzie is shocked in place. Trying to process...
E: CONT’D O.S. CONT’D
C: 132 IZZIE 132
D: No... this isn’t right. You... you aren’t my mom. You don’t belong in this dream! The smile on the Mysterious Woman’s face melts... as does her disguise... revealing THE OLD BLIND LADY. Izzie screams! Drops SharkyJaw! The hazy dream scene around her immediately dissolving back into fog. Izzie glances around... realizes she’s in the foggy clearing all alone again. She turns to leave and discovers CREEPY VINES have tried to grow around her legs. She kicks them loose and flees the foggy clearing.
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - WITCH’S CAMP - SAME
N: Mateo still smiles serenely as he draws Z Blob. He looks up from his work to see the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN cloaked in shadow, standing in the corner of the room watching.
C: 133 MYSTERIOUS WOMAN 133
D: You see... You can come here every night. Draw whatever you want. This is just for you. And no one else. Isn’t this nice?
C: 134 MATEO 134
D: Yes... wait, no. This isn’t right.
C: 135 MYSTERIOUS WOMAN 135
D: What do you mean, sweetie?
C: 136 MATEO 136
D: My mom always encouraged me to show my drawings... I almost forgot... but she wanted me to share my art. Not keep it to myself. Mateo stops drawing. The hazy dream begins to waver. The Mysterious Woman begins to waver too... her disguise falling away to reveal the Old Blind Lady scowling. 137 OLD BLIND LADY 137 Fine! Have it your way! And the dream scene is DISPELLED... falling away to reveal Mateo and Z Blob standing back in the Witch’s Camp. The Old Blind Lady standing near the bubbling pot, still scowling. 138 OLD BLIND LADY 138 But you’ll change your mind next time. You’ll see.
E: CONT’D
C: 139 MATEO 139
D: Lady, there isn’t gonna be a next time, I’m never coming back here! 140 OLD BLIND LADY 140 Dear, you’re never going to leave... Mateo tries to move. Realizes he’s ensnared in swampy vines that have grown up around his legs... He reaches for his hourglass at his side, only to realize it’s -- Across the room. Sitting on a shelf amidst the Old Lady’s jars and baubles. Mateo glares at the woman.
C: 141 MATEO 141
D: Why are you doing this?!
N: 142 NIGHT HUNTER (O.S.) 142 Because she’s trapped here... Everyone turns to see the Hunter slowly enter the camp. 143 NIGHT HUNTER (CONT’D) 143 Putting herself in these dreams is the only way she won’t be forgotten. The Old Lady growls. 144 OLD BLIND LADY 144 You... you’re not welcome here!
C: 145 NIGHT HUNTER 145
D: Who’s gonna make me leave? You? She suddenly chuckles. 146 OLD BLIND LADY 146 A few things have changed since last time we saw each other.
C: 147 NIGHT HUNTER 147
D: Last time we saw each other, you could still see... Z Blob notices the cauldron begin to bubble and boil. He hops up and peeks in to see -- A PAIR OF EYEBALLS bubble to the surface of the murky concoction in the pot... Z Blob scrambles away from the cauldron as the witch's FAMILIAR crawls out of it - a huge WOLF-LIKE CREATURE that grows to full size, the cauldron becoming its collar as it -- Lunges towards the Hunter!
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - FOG - SAME
N: Izzie races back through the fog. Nearly colliding with Logan who drops his boombox. Izzie screams! Logan screams! Oz and Cooper race up out of the fog, alarmed!
C: 148 MR. OZ 148
D: What is it? What’s wrong?
C: 149 IZZIE 149
D: We gotta get outta here! If we stay any longer, she’ll trap us in the dreams of our past.
C: 150 COOPER 150
D: What are you talking about? Who is “she?”
C: 151 IZZIE 151
D: I’ll explain later! We gotta find my brother and Zoey and get out of here! C’mon! As the group follows Izzie out, Logan picks up the boombox. Realizes it’s broken.
C: 152 LOGAN 152
D: Bro... my beats!
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - WITCH’S CAMP - SAME
N: Mateo struggles to free himself from the vines as the Wolf and Hunter battle it out. The Old Lady cackles, her familiar getting the advantage on the Hunter as his crossbow is knocked from his grip. As the Hunter struggles, Z Blob uses the distraction to STRETCH his blobby form out, towards Teo’s hourglass... 153 OLD BLIND LADY 153 You and your Master always underestimated me... never came to my aid when those meddlesome Night Bureau agents imprisoned me... but now you’ll finally see... The Wolf looms over the unarmed Hunter... 154 OLD BLIND LADY (CONT’D) 154 Everyone made a huge mistake trying to forget about me... Z snaps the hourglass to Teo! It alights with energy as he dreamcrafts Z Blob into KNIGHT MODE! The Old Lady shrieks! Sir Z hacks at the vines, freeing Mateo! He stumbles back, colliding with a shelf of jars that fall to the ground. Mateo is about to run, when he notices one jar in particular -- The one swirling with Zoey’s memory dream... The Old Lady yells out! The Wolf pivots and charges towards Mateo! He quickly doubles back and scoops up Zoey’s dream as -- Sir Z punches the Wolf! Sending it flying into the Hunter! Both going down in a heap! Sir Z scoops up Mateo and they flee the Witch’s Camp as the Old Lady HOWLS in frustration!
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - DAY
N: As Izzie leads Oz and the others through the fog, she
C: hears Zoey’s voice SINGING/HUMMING...
D: Izzie quickly hones in on Zoey’s voice, the others following, stumbling into the -- PARK SCENE -- where they find Zoey entranced by her memory dream. Humming along with the melody her mother is playing on the guitar.
C: 155 IZZIE 155
D: Zoey?! But she doesn’t respond. Doesn’t even take note of their presence.
C: 156 COOPER 156
D: Whoa, what happened... They see the vines have nearly grown up to her waist. Rooting her in place.
C: 157 IZZIE 157
D: See! This is what I was talking about!
C: 158 LOGAN 158
D: Bro, we gotta get her outta here... They converge on Zoey and struggle to break her free. But she’s absorbed in the memory dream. And the vines keep growing...
C: 159 MR. OZ 159
D: Zoey, listen to me! You have to focus... this isn’t real... The vines snake up Zoey, nearly consuming her as -- MATEO AND SIR Z burst into the foggy dream! Z grabbing hold of Zoey’s outstretched hand and yanking her free! The hazy dream scene wavers and begins to dissolve into the fog. Zoey loses sight of her mom. 160 MR. OZ 160 We have to go!
E: CONT’D
C: 161 ZOEY 161
D: Mom! Noooo! The gang flees the fog. Zoey cradled in Z’s huge arms.
E: struggling to get free of Z
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - SANDMAN’S TOWER - DAY
N: The gang emerges from the fog. Exhausted. Z setting a shell-shocked Zoey to the ground as he morphs back to blob form. They catch their breath, take in their new surroundings: In the distance, a massive sand dune, and the SANDMAN'S TOWER siting at the top, dominating the horizon.
C: 162 MR. OZ 162
D: The Tower... we made it.
C: 163 COOPER 163
D: Mr. Oz... They turn to see a PACK OF SIRENS slowly gathering... blocking the path to the Tower in the distance. Their bewitching song begins to seep in... Weary and spent, the gang prepares to face yet another threat. Until -- LOGAN’S AWFUL MUSIC cascades in from above...
C: 164 IZZIE 164
D: Wait, is that...
C: 165 LOGAN 165
D: My sick beats! ALBERT swoops in on Oz’s ship, blasting Logan music. The Sirens scatter as Albert lands the ship and disembarks. He marches up to Logan and thrusts the phone in his hand.
C: 166 ALBERT 166
D: Young man, if I never have to listen to your infernal racket again, it’ll be too soon. Mateo turns to Zoey.
C: 167 MATEO 167
D: You okay? She can’t answer. Z Blob tries to comfort her, but she starts to walk away. Mateo catches up.
C: 168 MATEO 168
D: Hey... Zoey! She can’t look him in the eye.
E: CONT’D
C: 169 ZOEY 169
D: I lost it. The dream of my mom and the
C: song she sang. I...
D: He reaches in his pack.
C: 170 MATEO 170
D: I get it. I understand now why you were so hesitant to share your music. He hands her something. She looks down -- IT’S THE JAR WITH HER DREAM IN IT...
C: 171 MATEO 171
D: Sometimes when something is that special to you, you just want to protect it. Zoey realizes what Mateo has given her. Looks at him... her face a mess of emotions. She hugs him, fiercely. Albert pulls Oz aside.
E: CONT’D
C: 172 ALBERT 172
D: What the heck happened in there?
C: 173 MR. OZ 173
D: Albert my friend, let’s just say I’ve got some research to do.
C: 174 LOGAN 174
D: Yo, Mr. Oz - what’s your research say about that? The gang all turns to see -- Something moving through the sand towards them, beginning to take shape... finally rising up and forming like a shimmering golem...
C: 175 MR. OZ 175
D: That, at long last, is the Sandman.
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - MYSTERIOUS ISLAND - DAY
N: Back at the island’s edge, the Hunter emerges from the fog, out of breath, damaged, and casting a scared look behind him -- As THE WITCH and her WOLF are hot on his heels, barreling forward... He’s in for a world of hurt but -- They come to a sudden stop at the DREAM RUNES carved in the ground... The Hunter laughs...
C: 176 NIGHT HUNTER 176
D: You might stay alive by putting yourself in those dreams... but you'll still be stuck here forever. I won't be responsible for freeing you. He shoots her one last smirk. Then retreats into the fog... The Witch looks at her familiar and chuckles. 177 OLD BLIND LADY 177 Oh you won't be the one responsible for freeing me, dear...
S: EXT. MURKY REALM - SANDMAN’S TOWER - DAY
N: Oz and the gang stand before the Sandman. He’s looking at the broken hourglass through a jeweler’s eyepiece. The Sandman speaks with a kindly old man’s voice. (Think Billy Crystal)
C: 178 SANDMAN 178
D: Ehhh, here’s your problem right here. This thing is cracked! Really diminishes the value...
C: 179 IZZIE 179
D: Umm... Mr. The Sandman, sir?
C: 180 SANDMAN 180
D: It’s pronounced “SAN-muhn.” Mr. SAN-muhn. The gang trades a confused look.
C: 181 MR. OZ 181
D: Thing is, Mr. Sandman... we aren’t trying to sell it. We’re ah, trying to fix it.
C: 182 SANDMAN 182
D: Oy vey... Well... That’ll cost ya. One dream.
C: 183 MATEO 183
D: What?!
C: 184 SANDMAN 184
D: Everything has a cost. I need a dream.
C: 185 COOPER 185
D: Wh-- Well why can’t you just, I dunno, use the MOUNTAIN OF DREAM SAND over there?!
C: 186 SANDMAN 186
D: Bubbalah, that is not how this works. Look, people have dreams... the forgotten ones wash up here...
E: MORE
C: SANDMAN
D: I recycle them into the ether and they become new dreams... The cycle continues. Those are the rules.
E: CONT'D
C: 187 COOPER 187
D: Well... those are dumb rules!
C: 188 SANDMAN 188
D: Dreams aren’t meant to be bottled up inside. They can only truly live on if you share them with others...
C: 189 LOGAN 189
D: Bro. How are we supposed to bring you a dream?
C: 190 ZOEY 190 I know...
D: Mateo watches Zoey step forward. A realization slamming home.
C: 191 MATEO 191
D: Wait, no - Zoey don’t do this to yourself.
C: 192 ZOEY 192
D: It’s okay. Really. Besides... this isn’t about me. Z Blob grunts his affection. She musters up her courage... And hands over the jar with her dream in it. The Sandman looks at it. Looks to her. Smiles kindly.
C: 193 SANDMAN 193
D: Now... let’s see about fixing this hourglass. The gang all gathers around to watch as the Sandman opens the jar. The ethereal contents begin to drift out into the air and they all watch Zoey’s Dream... As she scans the faces of her friends watching her mom play the song, Zoey smiles. But if we didn’t know better, we’d swear we heard the Old Blind Lady’s laughter echo out... FADE TO BLACK... END OF EPISODE
