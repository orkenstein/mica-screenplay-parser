N:     The NIGHTMARE KING gazes through the headpiece of his
N:     staff... spying on LOGAN and the DREAM CHASERS through
N:     the hat as SNEAK, SNIVEL and SUSAN bicker in the
N:     background.

D:               Quiet, you fools! I’m trying to hear what
D:               the Dream Chasers’ next move is...

N:               Next!
N:     LOGAN takes the stage in the cafeteria. A banner
N:     decorated with Halloween imagery behind him reads - FALL
C:     CARNIVAL AUDITIONS.
D:     MS. PUTNAM, the LIBRARIAN, and COACH JEFFREYS stand
D:     expectantly with clipboards in hand. When Coach looks up
D:     to see Logan, he smirks.
C: 3                          COACH JEFFREYS                       3
D:               Time out... you’re auditioning for the
D:               carnival main stage?!

D:               Can’t have a block party without some
D:               sick beats, Coach...
E:                      (plugs in his phone)
D:               Now, get ready to have your faces melted
D:               by the musical mastery of DJ LOGANATOR!
D:     Logan picks up the microphone. Hits play on his phone --
D:     CROSS CUT THE SHADOWKEEP -- Teeth-clenching EDM beats
D:     BOOM out of the Nightmare King’s staff! We hear Logan
D:     improvising lyrics and noises...
D:     The Nightmare King painfully grabs his ears! SNEAK,
D:     SNIVEL and SUSAN can't help but dance a little as we --

N:     Logan’s “music” THUDS out from behind the closed

N:     exchanging skeptical looks as they wait in the hall.

N:      A LOCKER SLAM causes Mateo to glance over and see ZOEY
N:      hastily gathering her books.
C: 6                           MATEO                                6
D:                You gonna audition?
C: 7                           ZOEY                                 7
D:                Do I look like someone who auditions?
C: 8                           IZZIE (O.S.)                         8
D:                You look like someone who--
D:      Zoey pivots to glare at Izzie as she comes bounding up.
C: 9                           ZOEY                                 9
D:                Don’t.
D:      Izzie’s mouth hangs open. She WANTS to continue that
D:      thought. The look on Zoey’s face convinces her otherwise.
D:      Logan bursts out of the cafeteria door.
C: 10                          LOGAN                                10
D:                Totally nailed it.
D:      Coach Jeffreys emerges right after. Still wincing and
D:      rubbing his ears.
C: 11                          COACH JEFFREYS                       11
D:                I wouldn’t hold your breath, champ.
E:                       (looks to the others)
D:                Anybody else wanna audition?
D:      Mateo glares at Zoey. She shakes her head.
C: 12                          ZOEY                                 12
D:                Look, just because some people want to
D:                share their dreams with the world,
D:                doesn’t mean everyone wants to. You of
D:                all people should know...
D:      As Mateo watches Zoey head out, he catches sight of his
D:      own comic artwork adorning the CARNIVAL POSTERS.
D:      Coach Jeffreys shrugs. Heads back inside the cafeteria.
C: 13                          LOGAN                                13
D:                Don’t sweat it guys. I’ll practice my
D:                skills tonight. Show Coach I can DJ with
D:                the best of them.
E: 14                          MR. OZ (O.S.)                        14
D:                No time for extracurricular shenanigans,
D:                gang...
D:      The kids turn to see Oz arrive in a bluster. Arms full of
D:      papers.

N:                Tonight we’re finally tracking down the
N:                Sandman... Meet me at the Landing, and
N:                don’t be late! I’ll explain everything...
N:      As Oz shuffles off, the kids turn to each other. Logan
N:      looks bummed.
C: 16                          LOGAN                               16
D:                You guys ever think about going back to
D:                having normal dreams? Like, just being a
D:                regular kid again?

D:                Look, we just gotta fix the hourglass and
D:                put a stop to the Nightmare King. We’re
D:                so close! Now that Mr. Oz knows where the
D:                Sandman is, I bet it’s gonna be smooth

N:      IN THE CABIN -- MATEO, IZZIE, COOP, LOGAN and ZOEY brace
N:      themselves.

D:                How did they find us so quickly?!
D:      We see the HAT on Logan’s head. He YELPS as Albert

D:                With Zoey’s help, I was able to decipher
D:                the musical clue from our dearly departed
D:                friend Jim the Yeti. I realized it was a
D:                SIREN SONG... only sung by the fabled
D:                sirens of the Murky Realm. It must be the
D:                location of the Sandman’s Tower!

D:      IN THE DISTANCE: The Sandman's tower. A rocky island
D:      reefed in fog, dunes of Dream Sand cascade off. The tower

D:                exacts its inevitable toll and we begin

D:      Gulp... Mateo hesitates... then sees several OTHER
D:      HIDEOUS SIRENS emerge from the fog... surrounding him.

N:                Suit yourselves. But when you forget all
N:                the little pieces of yourself, don’t come
N:                crying to me.
N:      She turns and waddles off into the mist. The glow of her
N:      lantern receding in the murk.
N:      Zoey trades a look with Mateo and turns to follow. Teo
N:      grabs her.

D:                The Hunter took the song my mom used to
D:                sing to me and twisted it. Just to taunt
D:                me. The only thing I have left of her now
D:                is a dream where she...
E:                       (beat)
D:                Teo, I can feel myself forgetting that
D:                dream. I’m forgetting how to play. I’m
D:                forgetting all the little pieces of me.
D:      She looks at the retreating form of the Old Lady.
C: 96                          ZOEY (CONT’D)                       96
D:                I’m not gonna let that happen.
D:      She heads into the murk. Mateo grapples with a decision.
D:      Glances back to see the ghostly forms of the SIRENS
D:      beginning to close in... and then chases after Zoey.
D:      As the Sirens converge and continue their pursuit --
D:      FFWIIP! FFWIIP! They are cut down in a hail of crossbow
D:      bolts...
D:      THE NIGHT HUNTER swoops down from one of the trees. He
D:      walks forward, scanning the murk. Then pauses...

D:       She glances around the murky landscape, lost in the fog.
D:       Just silhouettes of scraggly trees around her.
D:       Then she hears it... the faint sound of a GUITAR... Zoey
D:       strains to listen... eyes going wide with recognition!

N:       burning... an iron cooking pot bubbling...
N:       And built into the surrounding trees, shelves upon

D:       manipulating time... battle raging all over the clearing.
D:       Even without her arrows, Zoey’s a force to be reckoned

D:                 My mom always encouraged me to show my

D:                 wanted me to share my art. Not keep it to
D:                 myself.
D:       Mateo stops drawing. The hazy dream begins to waver. The
D:       Mysterious Woman begins to waver too... her disguise
D:       falling away to reveal the Old Blind Lady scowling.

D:       Mateo tries to move. Realizes he’s ensnared in swampy
D:       vines that have grown up around his legs... He reaches
D:       for his hourglass at his side, only to realize it’s --
D:       Across the room. Sitting on a shelf amidst the Old Lady’s
D:       jars and baubles. Mateo glares at the woman.
C: 141                          MATEO                               141

C: 181                          MR. OZ                           181
D:                 Thing is, Mr. Sandman... we aren’t trying
D:                 to sell it. We’re ah, trying to fix it.
C: 182                          SANDMAN                          182
D:                 Oy vey... Well... That’ll cost ya. One
D:                 dream.
C: 183                          MATEO                            183

C: 184                          SANDMAN                          184
D:                 Everything has a cost. I need a dream.
C: 185                          COOPER                           185
D:                 Wh-- Well why can’t you just, I dunno,
D:                 use the MOUNTAIN OF DREAM SAND over
D:                 there?!
C: 186                          SANDMAN                          186
D:                 Bubbalah, that is not how this works.

D:                 I recycle them into the ether and they
D:                 become new dreams... The cycle continues.
D:                 Those are the rules.
C: 187                          COOPER                             187
D:                 Well... those are dumb rules!
C: 188                          SANDMAN                            188
D:                 Dreams aren’t meant to be bottled up
D:                 inside. They can only truly live on if
D:                 you share them with others...
C: 189                          LOGAN                              189
D:                 Bro. How are we supposed to bring you a
D:                 dream?
C: 190                          ZOEY                               190
C:                 I know...
D:       Mateo watches Zoey step forward. A realization slamming
D:       home.
C: 191                          MATEO                              191
D:                 Wait, no - Zoey don’t do this to
D:                 yourself.
C: 192                          ZOEY                               192
D:                 It’s okay. Really. Besides... this isn’t
D:                 about me.
D:       Z Blob grunts his affection. She musters up her
D:       courage... And hands over the jar with her dream in it.
D:       The Sandman looks at it. Looks to her. Smiles kindly.
C: 193                          SANDMAN                            193
D:                 Now... let’s see about fixing this
D:                 hourglass.
D:       The gang all gathers around to watch as the Sandman opens
D:       the jar. The ethereal contents begin to drift out into
D:       the air and they all watch Zoey’s Dream...
D:       As she scans the faces of her friends watching her mom
D:       play the song, Zoey smiles.
D:       But if we didn’t know better, we’d swear we heard the Old
D:       Blind Lady’s laughter echo out...
D:       FADE TO BLACK...
D:       END OF EPISODE
