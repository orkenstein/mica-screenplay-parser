S: 1 EXT. LANDING (DREAM WORLD) – DAY 1
N: OPEN ON ZOEY, astride ZION, swooping over the landing. She scours the horizon for Oz’ rocket ship bus. From her vantage point, we see -- MATEO, IZZIE, Z BLOB, LOGAN and COOPER gathered together. Logan looks up, locks eyes with her. Lifts a hand to wave, then stops himself. Zoey swings Zion around, staying in the air a little longer. ON Mateo, clocking the hurt in Logan’s eyes. Logan feels his gaze.
C: 1 LOGAN 1
D: Dude, what?
N: Logan stomps off. Cooper shrugs, follows Logan over to the other side of the landing. Mateo turns to Izzie, confused.
C: 2 MATEO 2
D: What’s Logan’s problem?
C: 3 IZZIE 3
D: Firstly, when is Logan NOT in a mood? Secondly, he asked Zoey out, but she shut him down hard. Maybe she likes someone else.
E: shrugs
N: Mateo can’t help it -- he perks up. Exchanges a hopeful glance with Z Blob, who flashes an encouraging grin. Mateo cocks an eyebrow at Izzie.
C: 4 MATEO 4
D: How do you know all this anyways?
N: Izzie waggles her hands in front of her face mysteriously.
C: 5 IZZIE 5
D: I see and know alllllllll.
N: Mateo’s unsure whether to laugh or be worried. Zoey swoops by overhead --
C: 6 ZOEY 6
D: They’re here!
N: Mateo looks up and spots OZ’S ROCKET SHIP BUS as -- 2 TITLE SEQUENCE ROLLS 2 Music swells... and we HARD CUT TO -- LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 2.
S: 3 EXT. LANDING (DREAM WORLD) - DAY 3
N: MR. OZ, holding LUNA’S HOURGLASS, and ALBERT emerge from the ship. Albert whistles loudly for everyone’s attention.
C: 7 MR. OZ 7
D: Huddle up. Let’s hear what Cooper’s figured out.
N: Oz hands the Hourglass to Cooper, who steps forward.
C: 8 COOPER 8
D: Okay, the key to unlocking Luna’s Hourglass was realizing that things aren’t always what they seem.
C: 9 LOGAN 9
D: Dude, you sound like Mrs. C.
N: Albert waggles his eyebrows at Logan disapprovingly as Cooper gestures to THREE RINGS at the top, middle, and bottom of the Hourglass. Each ring is emblazoned with DECORATIVE IMAGES.
C: 10 COOPER 10
D: See the symbols on these rings? They’re actually... A cryptex!
E: wait for it
C: 11 IZZIE 11
D: A what-tex?
C: 12 ALBERT 12
D: Cryptex. It’s a kind of old- fashioned puzzle.
C: 13 COOPER 13
D: You rotate the rings into the correct position and boom! Puzzle solved and we’re on our way to Castle Nocturna.
E: excited
N: Excited, Izzie hugs Zoey then does a little victory dance.
C: 14 IZZIE 14
D: Going to the castle! Going to meet Luna! Going to have some awesome snacks! And ask her how she defeated the Nightmare King.
E: off Albert’s stern look
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 3.
C: 15 MATEO 15
D: So which symbols unlock the puzzle?
E: to Cooper
C: 16 COOPER 16
D: Yeah, about that...
E: prevaricating
C: 17 ZOEY 17
D: You have no idea, do you?
C: 18 COOPER 18
D: Nope. But hey, it’s a start.
E: upbeat
C: 19 ALBERT 19
D: There’s thousands of possible combinations to a cryptex. This could take forever.
E: groans
N: Oz and Albert look concerned but the kids are undeterred.
C: 20 MATEO 20
D: Not if we can help it. Let’s see the first ring, Coop.
E: determined
N: Cooper holds up the Hourglass -- the first ring is emblazoned with letters, animals, flowers, etc. Mateo spots a MOON.
C: 21 MATEO 21
D: There! The moon could stand for Luna!
E: CONT'D
N: Cooper spins the first ring so the moon symbol is in front. As it CLICKS into place, the hourglass GLOWS.
C: 22 ZOEY 22
D: Sweet! Nice work, Mateo.
N: Mateo grins under Zoey’s praise. Logan glares. As everyone starts throwing out guesses for the second ring (some of which Coop tries but don’t work) --
C: 23 IZZIE 23
D: Um, did Zoey just compliment you?
E: sotto, to Teo
C: 24 MATEO 24
D: Yeah, super weird.
E: sotto, to Izzie
N: But Mateo’s wheels are spinning -- maybe Zoey likes him. LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 4.
C: 25 LOGAN 25
D: Look! An infinity symbol. That could refer to all the realms under a Dream Keeper’s protection.
N: Cooper spins the infinity symbol to the front of the second ring. As it CLICKS into place, the hourglass GLOWS again. Logan fist pumps. Peeks at Zoey for a reaction. She’s giving him nothing. She studies the third ring...
C: 26 ZOEY 26
D: Maybe that olive branch symbolizes peace.
N: Cooper high-fives Zoey... spins the third ring into place... all the symbols line up... and the Hourglass suddenly BLAZES with light! Everyone shields their eyes... and then... all the sand falls out! Cooper groans.
C: 27 IZZIE 27
D: That was s’posed to happen, right?
C: 28 LOGAN 28
D: Dude, you broke it!
N: Our team deflates. Suddenly... WHOOSH! The sand zooms off like a comet! As the others stare, stunned, Zoey leaps astride Zion and takes to the skies.
C: 29 ZOEY 29
D: Zion, go!
N: Oz recovers first, races for the Rocket Bus.
C: 30 MR. OZ 30
D: After that sand, Dream Chasers!
N: As our team sprints towards the ship, CUT TO --
S: 4 EXT. FANTASY REALM (DREAM WORLD) - DAY 4
N: CLOSE ON MRS. CASTILLO snoozing peacefully at the window of her food truck. WIDEN OUT to reveal SEÑOR TORTUGA munching on a gingerbread house as an annoyed GINGERBREAD COUPLE watch. Suddenly, the couple catch sight of something O.S. and gape.
C: 31 GINGERBREAD MAN 31
D: What the--?!?!
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 5. BAWOOSH! Oz’s rocket ship BLASTS by, blowing the gingerbread couple off their feet. 32 GINGERBREAD MAN/GINGERBREAD WOMAN 32 Whoooaaaa! / Oh sugar! Off Mrs. C undisturbed, snoring loudly, CUT TO --
S: 5 INT. OZ’S ROCKET SHIP - DAY - CONTINUOUS 5
N: Z Blob jiggles happily in his seat from the velocity of the bus rocketing through the dream ether. DREAM REALMS pass by the bus windows in a blur. WIDEN OUT to reveal Mateo, Logan, Cooper, and Izzie in their seats. Oz and Albert in front, manning the controls. Mateo cranes his neck to see outside.
C: 33 MATEO 33
D: There’s Zoey!
C: 34 LOGAN 34
D: Where? Is she okay?
E: worried
N: Logan unbuckles his seatbelt and stands. Awkwardly leans across Mateo to look out. OUTSIDE -- Zoey and Zion hot on the sand comet’s tail. They bank left and right, following the comet’s every move. Suddenly, WHOOSH! The sand comet flies straight up -- Oz jerks the controls sharply. Takes the bus vertical. Logan tumbles down the center aisle, hits the bulkhead door. THWAP!
C: 35 MATEO 35
D: Think Logan will ever learn to stay buckled in when Oz is at the wheel?
E: to Z Blob
N: Z Blob shakes his head ‘no’ as we CUT TO --
S: 6 EXT. SKIES (DREAM WORLD) – CONTINUOUS 6
N: An epic shot of Zoey, Zion, and the rocket ship bus streaking through puffy pink clouds of Dream Ether after the sand comet. As the sand zooms higher and higher, the clouds get thicker and thicker until... LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 6.
S: 7 INT. OZ’S ROCKET SHIP - DAY - CONTINUOUS 7
N: Oz and Albert peer out the window into a seemingly endless layer of ominous, grey clouds.
C: 36 ALBERT 36
D: This is starting to feel like a wild goose chase, Oswald.
C: 37 MR. OZ 37
D: I’ve never understood that analogy. Are we the geese? Or the ones chasing the geese?
N: ON Mateo and Z Blob, gazing intently out the window.
C: 38 MATEO 38
D: C’mon, castle. Please be here... we need Luna’s help to stop the Dark Army.
N: As if in answer to Mateo’s plea, the clouds part and we suddenly see... CASTLE NOCTURNA! It’s a CRYSTALLINE MEDIEVAL CASTLE towering over a barren rocky realm. (Think Jim Henson’s Dark Crystal meets Superman’s Fortress of Solitude.) The kind of place that could only exist in the Dream World. The kids are awestruck.
C: 39 MATEO/IZZIE/COOPER 39
D: Holy cow. / Daaaang. / Whoa.
N: Nearing the end of their long search, Oz and Albert beam.
C: 40 ALBERT 40
D: We made it, old friend.
N: Logan picks himself up off the floor to peer outside.
C: 41 LOGAN 41
D: It’s... it’s...
E: awed
S: 8 EXT. ROCKY REALM (DREAM WORLD) – MOMENTS LATER 8
N: ON Logan, aghast.
C: 42 LOGAN 42
D: A pile of crap.
E: aghast
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 7. REVERSE to reveal Castle Nocturna’s true state. Up close, the crystalline castle’s walls are dirty, dull and overgrown with THICK VINES. The place is dormant, uninviting, and creepy. The sand swirls back into Luna’s Hourglass, settles inside. Our team brightens. An expectant beat. Nothing happens.
C: 43 MR. OZ 43
D: Luna would never leave the castle in such a state. She’s really gone...
E: stricken
N: His worst fears seemingly realized, Oz is overcome with emotion. Albert places a comforting hand on his shoulder.
C: 44 COOPER 44
D: So... we got this far for nothing?
C: 45 MR. OZ 45
D: Not necessarily. In our research, Albert and I discovered that Luna made a record of how to defeat the Nightmare King before she vanished.
E: composes himself
C: 46 ALBERT 46
D: And Logan heard the Nightmare King say he wanted to erase the story of how he was defeated.
N: Zoey’s head snaps up.
C: 47 ZOEY 47
D: You two think Luna left the book here...
C: 48 MR. OZ 48
D: Precisely. To the library!
N: As our team approaches Castle Nocturna, Z Blob ducks inside Mateo’s backpack. Mateo reassures him.
C: 49 MATEO 49
D: I know buddy. I wish this place didn’t look so dang scary, too.
N: Off Z Blob peeking out, apprehensive, DISSOLVE TO --
S: 9 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNA – GREAT HALL – MOMENTS LATER 9
N: As the team enters the Hall, they look around, taking it all in... dark shadows dot the edges of the room. LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 8. A long BANQUET TABLE in the middle is set for dinner but covered in cobwebs. Dusty shields and tapestries decorate the walls. The space feels eerie and dead.
C: 50 LOGAN 50
D: And I thought it was creepy outside.
N: Izzie catches sight of a LARGE HERALDIC TAPESTRY that piques her interest. It’s of a strange animal that our keen-eyed viewers will recognize as a MANTICORE -- head of a man, body of a lion, and a tail with a prickle of sharp spikes.
C: 51 IZZIE 51
D: Sweet, a manticore!
C: 52 COOPER 52
D: What’s a manticore?
C: 53 IZZIE 53
D: Only one of the most fearsome animals to ever walk the land!
C: 54 ZOEY 54
D: Manticore’s aren’t real.
E: scoffs
C: 55 IZZIE 55
D: Don’t listen to her, Coop. Manticore’s ARE real. I’ve read about them in my mythology books.
N: Zoey rolls her eyes -- the talk of myths proving her point.
C: 56 IZZIE 56
D: They’ve got the head of a man, the body of a lion, and the tail of a porcupine!
E: CONT'D
C: 57 ZOEY 57
D: A porcupine tail on a lion’s body? Not real. Not scary.
C: 58 IZZIE 58
D: I’d like to hear you say that with a quill sticking out of you.
E: under her breath
C: 59 LOGAN 59
D: Um, guys? You need to see this...
N: Our team heads over to Logan... peers into a dark alcove. Recoils. Reveal the terrible tableau within -- CRYSTALLINE DREAMLINGS frozen in terror. LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 9.
C: 60 IZZIE 60
D: Who would do this to Dreamlings?!
C: 61 COOPER 61
D: I thought Castle Nocturna was supposed to be safe!
N: The kids shuffle around. Afraid. Oz tries to hide it, but it’s clear he’s shook, too.
C: 62 MR. OZ 62
D: Don’t worry, I’m sure whatever did this is long gone.
E: totally unsure
N: Just then, the tapestries whip, disturbed by an eerie wind. And then -- SNAP! The sound of a tail cracking like a whip. WHOOSH! A poisonous QUILL streaks through the air -- SHUNK! The quill hits Oz and he turns to crystal!
C: 63 ALBERT 63
D: Oswald!
N: Izzie points to the quill, horrified.
C: 64 IZZIE 64
D: A manticore!
N: Before anyone can react, Zion catches sight of something slinking through the shadows... takes off after it! Zoey sprints after Zion. We hear the SNAP of a tail. Then WHOOSH! A poisonous quill flies from the shadows and... SHUNK! The QUILL pierces Zion’s side and he turns to crystal!
C: 65 ZOEY 65
D: Zion, NO!!
N: The rest of the team catches up with Zoey as she throws her arms around Zion.
C: 66 ZOEY 66
D: I’ll fix this. Promise.
E: CONT'D distraught
N: Logan goes to grab Zoey’s arm, stops himself. Pleads.
C: 67 LOGAN 67
D: That thing’s going to take us out if we don’t move!
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 10. Zoey is reluctant to leave Zion, but Mateo pulls her away.
C: 68 MATEO 68
D: We gotta go!
N: Panicked, the team races through large doors at the end of the Great Hall and into...
S: 10 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNA – HALLWAY – CONTINUOUS 10
N: A long hallway, grimy from years of neglect. Logan and Cooper SLAM the doors shut. RAAAGHH! A giant roar echoes. The door RATTLES with the force of something large but holds fast.
C: 69 COOPER 69
D: What do we do?
C: 70 ALBERT 70
D: Stay focused. Find the book.
C: 71 ZOEY 71
D: Screw that, I’m looking for a way to fix Zion.
N: Logan opens his mouth to offer to help. Mateo beats him to the punch.
C: 72 MATEO 72
D: I’ll go with you.
N: BOOM! The door RATTLES again.
C: 73 ALBERT 73
D: Fine, just steer clear of the manticore. Everyone else, with me.
C: 74 IZZIE 74
D: Manticore’s usually only react when provoked. Maybe we can reason with him.
E: animal expert mode
N: On cue, BOOOOM! A large PAW PUNCHES through the door, narrowly missing Izzie’s head! Wood splinters fly!
C: 75 IZZIE 75
D: On second thought... RUN!!
E: CONT'D
N: They sprint away, desperate to put some distance between them and the creature! All of a sudden -- LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 11. KRAAAK! FWOOSH! The hallway breaks into several pieces that SWING APART in different directions (think Hogwarts meets MC Escher)! The kids stumble, trying to keep their balance.
C: 76 MATEO/IZZIE/ZOEY/LOGAN/COOPER 76
D: WHOAAAAAA!
N: ON Zoey, as the piece she’s on tilts precariously, sending her sliding towards the edge. She nimbly leaps from one piece to another... trying to reunite with the others. But she’s thwarted by the MC Escher-esque castle. Zoey spots Logan, on a piece with Izzie, gesturing for her to jump to him.
C: 77 LOGAN 77
D: Zoey! Jump this way!
N: At the same time, Mateo, on a piece with Z Blob, whooshes past, too. Waves for Zoey to join him.
C: 78 MATEO 78
D: Zoey, we’re here!
N: Zoey’s eyes dart from Mateo to Logan. She runs, leaps -- WHAM! Knocks Mateo down. Lands on top of him!
C: 79 MATEO 79
D: Oof.
E: CONT'D
N: From his prone position, Mateo sees Logan, crestfallen, as he and Izzie are zoomed one way and Albert and Cooper another! Zoey scrambles to her feet, pulls Mateo up. But before they have a chance to even catch their breath -- SWOOSH! Their piece of hallway transforms into a circular SLIDE. They WHOOSH around and around and down to --
S: 11 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNA – CELLAR – CONTINUOUS 11
N: THUD! Mateo, Z Blob, and Zoey sprawl to a stop on the floor of a vaulted cellar. The detritus of eons of Dream Keepers – chests, furniture, books, paintings – stacked everywhere. Zoey jumps up to investigate.
C: 80 ZOEY 80
D: We could find something here to help Zion.
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 12. As Zoey starts looking, Z Blob nudges Mateo towards Zoey -- go join her.
C: 81 MATEO 81
D: Unh-uh.
E: sotto to Z Blob
N: Playing matchmaker, Z Blob is insistent. Mateo relents, hesitantly walks over to where Zoey is engrossed in pulling items out of a chest.
C: 82 MATEO 82
D: There must be centuries worth of Dream Keeper stuff in there.
E: CONT'D
C: 83 ZOEY 83
D: Maybe we’ll find the book too!
E: grinning
N: Zoey scooches over, making room for Mateo to join him. Z Blob flashes Mateo a grin. Off Zoey and Mateo searching together --
S: 12 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNA – APOTHECARY ROOM – CONTINUOUS 12
N: Albert and Coop rifle through shelves stuffed with books and old-fashioned glass bottles full of mysterious colorful liquids and preserved strange-looking creatures. But uh-oh, they’re so focused, they don’t notice a glimpse of TAWNY FUR pass by the open door. Albert cocks his head at a faint rustle of wings.
C: 84 ALBERT 84
D: Did you hear something?
C: 85 COOPER 85
D: Nope.
E: oblivious
N: Albert shrugs and goes back to his task -- pulling books off the shelf. Reaching for a book, Coop gets a cobweb stuck in his hair.
C: 86 COOPER 86
D: Blech. Gross.
E: CONT'D
N: Albert drops the heavy tomes on a nearby table. Dust billows. He starts rifling through their pages.
C: 87 ALBERT 87
D: These books aren’t going to look through themselves, Cooper.
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 13. On Coop, still wrestling with the cobweb. Flailing around, he accidentally swipes a glass bottle off the shelf. Catches it before it hits the ground.
C: 88 COOPER 88
D: Siren’s song. Cool.
E: reading the label
N: At the same time that Coop turns to show Albert -- SNAP! The flick of a tail and... WHOOSH! A poisonous QUILL zooms through the air and hits Albert, who turns to crystal! WHIP TO Cooper, staring agog --
C: 89 COOPER 89
D: Oh cr--
E: CONT'D
N: SNAP! WHOOSH! SHUNK! A quill lands in Cooper’s thigh. As he turns to crystal, he drops the bottle... It SHATTERS against the floor... the eerie wails of SIREN’S SONG fill the air. Off Cooper’s face, frozen in terror, we CUT TO --
S: 13 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNA – HALLWAY – CONTINUOUS 13
N: Logan and Izzie creeping down the decrepit hallway. Busts of former Dream Keepers line either side. They pause as the last wails of the Siren’s Song reach their ears.
C: 90 LOGAN 90
D: What was that?
E: spooked
C: 91 IZZIE 91
D: I don’t know.
N: Izzie suddenly spots a bust of a young Luna adorned with a CRYSTAL TIARA. Beelines for it.
C: 92 LOGAN 92
D: Wait, Izzie! Don’t touch that.
N: Logan flinches as Izzie plucks the tiara off the bust, ignoring him. Nothing happens. She flashes him a cocky grin.
C: 93 LOGAN 93
D: That could’ve been a trap.
E: CONT'D
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 14.
C: 94 IZZIE 94
D: Well it wasn’t. And now I’ve got this sweet tiara.
C: 95 LOGAN 95
D: We gotta stay focused and find the library. Yanno, where people keep their books?
C: 96 IZZIE 96
D: Isn’t that, yanno, too obvious for an all-powerful Dream Keeper?
C: 97 LOGAN 97
D: What? No, it’s logical.
E: taken aback
N: Izzie swings around, startling Logan. She takes him by the shoulders and shakes him.
C: 98 IZZIE 98
D: Forget logic! Follow your heart.
N: Too late, Izzie realizes what she’s said. Logan deflates.
C: 99 LOGAN 99
D: Yeah, tried that. Now Zoey hates me.
C: 100 IZZIE 100
D: She doesn’t hate you. Dislike you strongly? Yeah. But hey, that’s not hate.
E: off Logan’s hope
N: Logan sighs exasperated and stomps off down the hallway. As Izzie hurries to catch up, CUT TO --
S: 14 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNA – CELLAR – CONTINUOUS 14
N: CRASH! Mateo and Z Blob are startled from their searching by a plate smashing against the wall. They look over to Zoey, fists clenched, clearly pissed off.
C: 101 ZOEY 101
D: Ugh. There’s nothing here! It’s just a bunch of junk.
N: Zoey holds up another plate. Looks ready to hurl it against the wall. Mateo rushes to stop her. LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 15.
C: 102 MATEO 102
D: Whoa, whoa. Evil manticore-thing hunting us, remember?
N: Zoey puts down the plate.
C: 103 MATEO 103
D: C’mon, maybe the others have had better luck.
E: CONT'D
N: A thunderous ROAR freezes them in place. Scared. No way out.
C: 104 ZOEY 104
D: Quick, hide!
E: sotto
N: Zoey gestures to a stack of large paintings leaning against the wall. There’s a small space behind them. Zoey, Mateo, and Z Blob dive for cover as -- SCREEEEEECH! CLAWS scrape against a wall... Our trio huddle close... the scraping sound gets closer... Zoey clasps Mateo’s hand... He glances down. Terrified but ecstatic. He squeezes Zoey’s hand, she squeezes back. It’s dangerous and romantic. The clicking of CLAWED FEET pauses in front of their hiding place. Our trio tense... fearing the worst -- WHOOSH! The sound of wings flapping away. Whew! A beat. Then Mateo, Zoey, and Z Blob emerge, relieved. Mateo and Zoey’s hands are still intertwined.
C: 105 MATEO 105
D: That was a little too close.
E: with a ragged breath
N: Zoey lets go of Mateo’s hand.
C: 106 ZOEY 106
D: Ugh, gross.
N: Mateo jerks back, flustered.
C: 107 MATEO 107
D: W-w-what?
N: Zoey gestures to a portrait they were just hiding behind -- an idealized representation of the platonic love shared by LUNA and MIGO. Luna gazes wistfully at Migo, who looks up at her sweetly. (It’s done in the dreamy, art nouveau style of Alphonse Mucha.) LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 16. Mateo considers the painting, confused.
C: 108 MATEO 108
D: What’s so gross about that?
E: CONT'D
C: 109 ZOEY 109
D: Forget it...
C: 110 MATEO 110
D: No, really.
C: 111 ZOEY 111
D: Mateo! The Nightmare King is out there right now, wreaking havoc on the Dream World. We need to fix Zion and find Luna’s book.
C: 112 MATEO 112
D: So you’re avoiding my question?
E: blithely
C: 113 ZOEY 113
D: I don’t know why, okay? It just is! 114 114 Love’s stupid. People ghost you and you’re left alone. Happy?
E: blowing up searching
C: 114 MATEO 114
D: Wow.
C: 115 ZOEY 115
D: Wow what?
C: 116 MATEO 116
D: That’s an incredibly depressing point of view.
N: 111 Zoey huffs, exasperated, as we CUT TO -- 111
S: 15 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNA – ROTUNDA – CONTINUOUS 15
N: Logan and Izzie step inside a round room -- shadowed and dark. Izzie stops in her tracks and stares upwards, awed. Logan takes in the room quickly, turns on his heel to leave.
C: 117 LOGAN 117
D: Welp, I’ve seen all I need to see.
C: 118 IZZIE 118
D: Logan, look.
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 17.
C: 119 LOGAN 119
D: I did. No books. Not a library.
N: Izzie grabs his arm and points upwards.
C: 120 IZZIE 120
D: Logan, look!
N: Logan tilts his head back. Gapes at an incredible sight -- The rotunda’s domed ceiling is constructed of gorgeous, multi- colored STAINED-GLASS WINDOWS in the same dreamy style that we saw in the painting of Luna and Migo. [Note: The windows are dusty on the inside and obscured by THICK VINES covering the outside of the dome. Barely any light streams in through the glass.]
C: 121 LOGAN 121
D: Whoa.
C: 122 IZZIE 122
D: I have GOT to get a closer look.
N: Izzie darts over to a rickety staircase... starts climbing... reaches a narrow walkway around the base of the dome.
C: 123 LOGAN 123
D: Iz, we don’t have time for the grand tour! Remind me how I got stuck babysitting?
E: under his breath
C: 124 IZZIE 124
D: I heard that.
E: calls over her shoulder
N: Izzie wipes at a spot of dirt on the inside of one window. Through the glass she suddenly spots -- A LEONINE EYE peering back at her. She gasps and flails backwards, startled.
C: 125 IZZIE 125
D: The manticore!
E: CONT'D scared
N: A loud ROAR shakes the glass. Izzie whips around.
C: 126 IZZIE 126
D: It saw me!
E: CONT'D
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 18.
C: 127 LOGAN 127
D: C’mon, let’s move!
N: Izzie races down the stairs to join Logan. But when they turn towards the door -- RAAAGH!! The MANTICORE blocks their exit. And he’s a sight to behold! The head and mane of a lion. The torso of a man. Iridescent wings. He’d be stunning if his tail wasn’t flicking ominously -- razor sharp porcupine quills glinting. A beat. Then all hell breaks loose. The manticore SNARLS. Whips his tail around... Izzie dives out of the way. Logan POPS into his tiny blue BEAST MODE and shrinks in size. WHOOSH! The quills barely pass over his head! Izzie whips out her hourglass, begins to dreamcraft... the sand swirls into a giant ANIME-STYLE SWORD!
C: 128 IZZIE 128
D: Bunzaibunga!!!
N: Izzie grits her teeth, hefts her sword, and charges! The manticore releases another flurry of quills... Izzie whacks the projectiles off-course like a badass martial arts master.
C: 129 IZZIE 129
D: Lo-Lo, GO!
E: CONT'D
N: Lo-Lo breaks for the door as the manticore releases a fresh onslaught of quills. Izzie’s sword is a blur... she keeps advancing... until -- SHUNK! A quill pierces Izzie’s shoulder. She stares at it, disbelieving --
C: 130 IZZIE 130
D: Oh poopers.
E: CONT'D
N: Her sword clatters to the ground as she turns to crystal. As the manticore flies after Lo-Lo, CUT TO --
S: 16 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNA – GREAT HALL – CONTINUOUS 16
N: Zoey, Mateo, and Z Blob cautiously enter the room. Zoey’s eyes dart to Zion, still crystallized.
C: 131 ZOEY 131
D: I’m done running and hiding.
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 19.
C: 132 MATEO 132
D: Me too.
E: glancing at Oz
N: A booming ROAR splits the air. Zoey steps closer to Mateo.
C: 133 ZOEY 133
D: You sure you want to stay?
E: to Mateo
N: Mateo steps closer to Zoey.
C: 134 MATEO 134
D: Always.
N: ON Mateo, feeling the intimacy of the moment... decides to make a move... leans in for a kiss... BOOM! The doors slam open. Lo-Lo sprints inside! The manticore inches away. The manticore picks Lo-Lo up in his claws... hurls him across the room!
C: 135 LO-LO 135
D: AHHHHHHH!!
N: Lo-Lo CRASHES onto the banquet table -- sends place settings flying! Zoey races to his side, worried.
C: 136 ZOEY 136
D: Are you okay?
N: He shakes himself, POPS BACK into Logan.
C: 137 LOGAN 137
D: I’m good.
N: Zoey and Logan stare at each other. Awkward.
C: 138 MATEO 138
D: Uh, guys... little help here?
N: WHIP TO Mateo and Z Blob, facing down an irate manticore. Zoey and Logan spring into action. They snatch cutlery off the table and hurl it at the manticore, drawing his attention. The manticore flicks his tail... quills THWICK straight for them! Zoey flips out of the way. Logan dives behind a chair. THUNK! THUNK! THUNK! Peers out to see a line of razor sharp quills embedded in the chair. On Mateo. He whips out his HOURGLASS and turns to Z Blob... LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 20.
C: 139 MATEO 139
D: Ready, buddy?
E: CONT'D
N: Z Blob grins. Mateo dreamcrafts Z Blob into a NOBLE STEED. Grabs a LANCE off the wall and leaps astride. Charge! The manticore whips around to face them. GROWLS. Inches from impact. Mateo thrusts the lance forward... the manticore springs into the sky at the last second... the lance barely misses him! As Mateo pulls up hard on the reins to bring Z Blob around -- SLAM! Two clawed feet right to Z Blob steed’s side, sending him and Mateo to the ground. Z Blob turns back to his regular form. ON Zoey wrenching a sword from one of the frozen Dreamlings. She twirls it expertly.
C: 140 ZOEY 140
D: Let’s dance, furball.
N: Zoey races towards the manticore, dragging her sword along the ground and sending up a shower of SPARKS. It’s badass. It’s easy to see why Mateo and Logan are in love -- we’re all a little bit in love with Zoey. She slashes and feints, her sword is a blur... but the manticore parries her every move until -- Zoey’s sword grazes the manticore’s side. He HOWLS in pain and sweeps his wing around to knock Zoey off her feet!
C: 141 LOGAN 141
D: Zoey!
N: From Zoey’s POV, we see the manticore advance... out of the corner of her eye, she spots Logan racing towards her.
C: 142 ZOEY 142
D: Don’t be an idiot!
C: 143 LOGAN 143
D: Too late.
E: grits his teeth
N: The manticore flicks his tail... a quill flies straight for Zoey... Logan leaps and... SHUNK! Logan drops to the ground, crystallized. Zoey’s face crumples in anguish. As Zoey reacts to Logan getting turned into crystal, ANGLE ON Mateo as he realizes -- Logan is the one Zoey likes. LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 21. But there’s no time to dwell on it. Mateo dreamcrafts a barrage of arrows. THWICK! THWICK! They bounce harmlessly off the manticore’s tough hide! And then -- SNAP! The manticore cracks his tail like a whip firing quills like arrows. SHUNK! SHUNK! Mateo and Z Blob are turned to crystal! The manticore turns on Zoey -- last woman standing -- she brandishes her CLOCK. But before she can wind time --
C: 144 MANTICORE 144
D: Enough! Prove you are a worthy dreamer or be trapped forevermore...
N: The manticore SNAPS open his wings, transitioning us to... TEMPTATION SEQUENCE Zoey’s startled to find herself in a crystal cave (think Fortress of Solitude meets funhouse Hall of Mirrors). Cold. Disconcerting. Zoey stares at her reflection, which morphs into the manticore. He is everywhere and nowhere, cajoling.
C: 145 MANTICORE 145
D: I can see into your heart. I know what it desires.
E: CONT'D
C: 146 ZOEY 146
D: If you knew me, you’d know I’m heartless.
C: 147 MANTICORE 147
D: Tsk, tsk. We both know that’s not true. I sense a deep loneliness in you, Zoey.
N: That lands. Zoey flinches.
C: 148 MANTICORE 148
D: You may have a tough hide like me. But you’ve lost people and that takes a toll.
E: CONT'D
C: 149 ZOEY 149
D: You’re the reason I’m alone right now!
C: 150 MANTICORE 150
D: Years ago, Luna tasked me with protecting the castle.
E: MORE
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 22.
C: MANTICORE
D: Not knowing what guise the Nightmare King would come in, I must be sure you’re not him. Prove it and I’ll let your friends go.
E: CONT'D
C: 151 ZOEY 151
D: I’m not the Nightmare King!
E: aghast
C: 152 MANTICORE 152
D: Exactly what the Nightmare King would say.
C: 153 ZOEY 153
D: I hate him. I’m going to stop him from ruining the Dream World.
E: seething
C: 154 MANTICORE 154
D: Ahh, the one place you feel safe. The one place you can be yourself...
C: 155 ZOEY 155
D: You said it. Not me.
N: The manticore is suddenly next to Zoey. He curls a wing around her, persuasive.
C: 156 MANTICORE 156
D: But what if I could make the Dream World even better? Bring your parents back? Give you everything you could ever want... All you have to do is ask.
E: beat, then
N: The manticore gestures to where we see a silhouetted image of a young Zoey holding hands with her parents. Zoey wavers, clearly torn.
C: 157 MANTICORE 157
D: Wouldn’t you like to have a family?
E: CONT'D
N: Zoey closes her eyes. We FLASH to: Zion nuzzling her; Izzie hugging her; Cooper high-fiving her, Mateo huddling with her behind the painting; and finally, Logan leaping in front of her. She squares her shoulders and opens her eyes.
C: 158 ZOEY 158
D: <DEEP BREATH> I already have a family. So thanks but no thanks. I’m good.
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 23. With a SNAP of the manticore’s wings, we transition back to:
S: 17 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNA - GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS 17
N: The manticore gets in Zoey’s face. Menacing. Opens his mouth to flash his fangs. Zoey tenses, anticipating the worst...
C: 159 MANTICORE 159
D: That. Was. AWESOME!!
N: The manticore breaks into a HUGE GRIN. CLAPS his hands twice. Air horn blasts. An explosion of CONFETTI. Zoey’s jaw drops and she splutters as confetti rains down from the sky.
C: 160 ZOEY 160
D: W-w-what the heck?
N: The manticore holds up his paw as if to say wait a sec. He pulls a small voice modulator DEVICE off his neck. Crushes it. Grins. Says in a much friendlier, higher-pitched voice:
C: 161 MANTICORE 161
D: Whew, that’s better! You have no idea how happy I am to be done with the whole ‘scary manticore’ routine. Now, where were we?
C: 162 ZOEY 162
D: Beats me.
C: 163 MANTICORE 163
D: You did it! You passed Luna’s final test! And now... I have someone to talk to again!!
E: ecstatic
N: The manticore envelopes Zoey in a hug! She stares, dumb- founded as KRAAAK! The crystal encasing Mateo, Logan, Oz, and Z Blob breaks apart. It’s their turn to stare, stunned. Zion shakes himself, sending crystals TWINKLING to the ground. Spotting the manticore, Zion growls and charges!
C: 164 ZOEY 164
D: Zion, wait! He’s okay!
N: Zion slams to a stop. To everyone’s amazement, the manticore scratches Zion -- and he actually likes it! Zion flops onto his back for a belly rub.
C: 165 MANTICORE 165
D: Who’s a good kitty? You’re a good kitty!
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 24. That unlikely sight greets Albert, Cooper, and Izzie, who race in, looking for a fight. Come up short at the scene. Everyone stares, incredulous, as the manticore starts enthusiastically shaking hands.
C: 166 MANTICORE 166
D: Hey! Hi! How you doin’?
E: CONT'D
C: 167 COOPER 167
D: Hold up. You’re friendly?!
C: 168 MANTICORE 168
D: The friendliest!
N: The manticore shakes Z Blob’s hand so exuberantly it sends Z Blob bouncing up and down.
C: 169 MANTICORE 169
D: Love this green look you’ve got going on.
E: CONT'D
N: The manticore moves on to Izzie, who grins.
C: 170 IZZIE 170
D: I told them you’d be a big ol’ puffball once we got to know you!
C: 171 MANTICORE 171
D: Filipo Achaemenid Darius Cambysis at your service.
E: bowing over her hand
C: 172 IZZIE 172
D: Okay if I just call you Phil?
C: 173 MANTICORE 173
D: Works for me!
N: Phil gazes around at the sorry state the castle’s in.
C: 174 MANTICORE 174
D: I just wish I knew how to bring the castle back to life.
E: CONT'D
N: He gestures to the Dreamlings, still frozen in crystal.
C: 175 MANTICORE 175
D: My home used to be filled with love, light, and creativity. But it vanished the day Luna left, leaving the castle’s heart broken. In fact, I haven’t even been able to breathe a proper flame since then.
E: CONT'D
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 25. Phil ROARS but all that emerges is a tiny puff of smoke. It fizzles without a spark. Oz claps him on the back.
C: 176 MR. OZ 176
D: We can’t have that, Phil. You were born to breathe fire. Now then, where is that throne...
E: beat, then
N: Our team watches as Oz bends over to examine the floor of the Great Hall. He wanders aimlessly searching... ANGLE ON Mateo. He clocks Zoey sneaking a glance at Logan standing off to the side. Mateo sidles over to have a quiet conversation with Zoey.
C: 177 MATEO 177
D: So you’re willing to face down a manticore but you won’t go on one date with Logan?
C: 178 ZOEY 178
D: I don’t have time for distractions. As long as the Nightmare King is out there, the Dream World isn’t safe.
C: 179 MATEO 179
D: That’s true. But you’re not alone. You have all of us. And we make a great team. That’s not going to change if you give Logan a chance.
E: then, gently
N: Zoey fidgets, clearly torn.
C: 180 MATEO 180
D: Zoey you’re fearless, go talk to him.
E: CONT'D with a sigh
C: 181 ZOEY 181
D: When did you get so smart?
E: relenting
C: 182 MATEO 182
D: I’ve always been this smart?
N: Zoey and Mateo exchange a smile -- it’s not romance but it is friendship and for now, it’s good enough. ANGLE ON Logan, surprised to see Zoey walk up to stand close beside him. She bumps his shoulder, playfully. LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 26.
C: 183 ZOEY 183
D: Hey.
C: 184 LOGAN 184
D: Hey.
N: Logan grins like a doofus. ON Mateo watching them. Z Blob reaches up to clasp Mateo’s hand sweetly. Nearby, Phil declares loudly:
C: 185 MANTICORE 185
D: He’s mad as a hatter, isn’t he?
E: re Oz
C: 186 IZZIE 186
D: For sure. But he usually knows what he’s doing.
N: Just then --
C: 187 MR. OZ 187
D: Aha! Found it.
N: Oz wipes the dust off an octagon shaped TILE in the floor. It’s decorated with a large SUNBURST. He presses down on the middle of the sun and -- THWUNK! With a grinding of GEARS... the entire tile FLIPS OVER! It rotates to reveal... A beautiful, crystal DAIS decorated with STARS and MOONS. Atop the dais rests a gorgeous, grand THRONE. Befitting a ruler of the Dream World. Our team lets out a startled GASP. Oz picks up Luna’s Hourglass. Gestures to an HOURGLASS shaped INDENTATION in the throne. 188 MR. OZ (CONT'D) 188 Luna once told me about her failsafe. All that’s left is to slot her Hourglass in and bring the castle back online. Oz holds the hourglass out to Mateo. 189 MR. OZ (CONT'D) 189 Care to do the honors? Mateo looks around at his friends. The fact they’ve gotten this far a testament to their strength as a team.
C: 190 MATEO 190
D: How ‘bout we all do the honors?
N: LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 27. Oz passes Mateo Luna’s Hourglass. The kids approach her throne. Mateo slots the hourglass in. Together, Mateo, Izzie, Cooper, Zoey, and Logan rotate the hourglass 180 degrees... As the sand starts to drain, a BEAM OF LIGHT shoots up from the top of the hourglass!! Our team stares in awe. CUT TO --
S: 18 EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNA - DAY - CONTINUOUS 18
N: The beam of light blazes brightly penetrating the grey dream ether all around the castle. As the light hits the clouds, they dissipate until the sun shines brightly on Castle Nocturna slowly coming back to life! Vines recede, dirt disappears, the dingy walls regain their luster until... We finally get to see Castle Nocturna in all its glory. It’s a translucent, iridescent crystal fairy tale castle! The sound of CHEERS erupts as we CUT TO --
S: 19 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNA - GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS 19
N: The interior of the Great Hall is transformed. It glitters and glistens. Gold and white pristine banners hang from the ceiling. Our team gazes in wonder. The Dreamlings shake free from their crystal prisons. Phil ROARS his approval, letting loose a blast of FLAME that forces everyone to dive for cover!
C: 191 MANTICORE 191
D: Oopsies.
N: As our team pick themselves up, the Dreamlings chitter excitedly and dog-pile Phil. Izzie excitedly joins the fray.
C: 192 IZZIE 192
D: So, Phil? Any awesome snacks up in heahhhh?
C: 193 MANTICORE 193
D: Of course! Why I could tell you about legions of incredible meals served at that very banquet table.
C: 194 IZZIE 194
D: Oooh, do tell.
N: Izzie leans in, all ears. But Albert clears his throat and steps forward, serious. LEGO 07/12/21 "The Worthy Dreamer" 28.
C: 195 ALBERT 195
D: I hate to break up this cozy scene, but we need to find Luna’s book.
C: 196 MR. OZ 196
D: Albert’s right. The sooner we discover the key to defeating the Nightmare King, the better.
N: Izzie grins, excited to drop a bombshell.
C: 197 IZZIE 197
D: What if I told you the book isn’t actually a book?
N: Off her cryptic announcement, we PUSH IN on Logan’s HAT where -- unbeknownst to our team -- the Nightmare King’s EYE TRACKER blinks ominously.
T: CUT TO:
S: 20 INT. SHADOWKEEP – GRIM REALM (DREAM WORLD) – CONTINUOUS 20
N: As the DARK ARCHER looks on, the NIGHTMARE KING projects an image from his staff: Our team... gathered together in Castle Nocturna...
C: 198 DARK ARCHER 198
D: They’re closer than we thought.
C: 199 NIGHTMARE KING 199
D: No matter. Tonight, we destroy Castle Nocturna once and for all!!
N: As the DARK ARMY lets out an unholy cheer, we CUT TO BLACK... END OF EPISODE
