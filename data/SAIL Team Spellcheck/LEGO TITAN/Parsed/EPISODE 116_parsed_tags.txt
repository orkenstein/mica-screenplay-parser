N:     OPEN ON ZOEY, astride ZION, swooping over the landing. She
N:     scours the horizon for Oz’ rocket ship bus. From her vantage
N:     point, we see --
0: 
N:     MATEO, IZZIE, Z BLOB, LOGAN and COOPER gathered together.
N:     Logan looks up, locks eyes with her. Lifts a hand to wave,
N:     then stops himself. Zoey swings Zion around, staying in the
N:     air a little longer.
0: 
N:     ON Mateo, clocking the hurt in Logan’s eyes. Logan feels his
N:     gaze.

D:               Dude, what?
0: 
N:     Logan stomps off. Cooper shrugs, follows Logan over to the
N:     other side of the landing. Mateo turns to Izzie, confused.

C: 2                       MATEO                                     2

D:               Firstly, when is Logan NOT in a
D:               mood? Secondly, he asked Zoey out,
D:               but she shut him down hard.
E:                   (shrugs)
D:               Maybe she likes someone else.
0: 
N:     Mateo can’t help it -- he perks up. Exchanges a hopeful
N:     glance with Z Blob, who flashes an encouraging grin. Mateo
N:     cocks an eyebrow at Izzie.

D:               I see and know alllllllll.

N:     Mateo’s unsure whether to laugh or be worried. Zoey swoops by

D:                  Okay, the key to unlocking Luna’s
D:                  Hourglass was realizing that things
D:                  aren’t always what they seem.

D:                  Dude, you sound like Mrs. C.
0: 
N:        Albert waggles his eyebrows at Logan disapprovingly as Cooper
N:        gestures to THREE RINGS at the top, middle, and bottom of the
N:        Hourglass. Each ring is emblazoned with DECORATIVE IMAGES.

D:                  Cryptex. It’s a kind of old-

D:                  solved and we’re on our way to

E:                      (determined)
D:                  Not if we can help it. Let’s see

N:        Cooper holds up the Hourglass -- the first ring is emblazoned
N:        with letters, animals, flowers, etc. Mateo spots a MOON.

N:        Cooper spins the first ring so the moon symbol is in front.
N:        As it CLICKS into place, the hourglass GLOWS.

D:                  Look! An infinity symbol. That
D:                  could refer to all the realms under
D:                  a Dream Keeper’s protection.
0: 
N:        Cooper spins the infinity symbol to the front of the second
N:        ring. As it CLICKS into place, the hourglass GLOWS again.
