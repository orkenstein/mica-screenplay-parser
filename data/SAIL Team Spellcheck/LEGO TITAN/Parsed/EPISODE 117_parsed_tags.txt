D:               Think about it. Luna wouldn’t hide
D:               the story of how to defeat the
D:               Nightmare King in a book! This is
D:               the Dream World, people.

N:     Our team -- MR. OZ, ALBERT, MATEO, Z BLOB, ZOEY, LOGAN,
N:     COOPER, PHIL, ZIAN, and the DREAMLINGS -- considers this.

D:               Point taken, Isabel. But if the
D:               story isn’t in a book, where is it?

N:     With a sweep of her arm, Izzie gestures upwards to the
N:     gorgeous, impressionistic STAINED-GLASS WINDOWS above them.
N:     Sunlight streams in, refracted through the colorful glass.

N:     ANGLE ON Mateo, staring at the windows, thoughtfully. From
N:     his POV, we see... each window is comprised of different-
N:     sized PANELS (like a MANGA COMIC). Mateo suddenly grins.
C: 6                       MATEO                                     6

D:                  Our favorite Bunchu Bunny manga is
D:                  a flip book. When you turn the
D:                  pages, the images animate.

D:                  What if the windows are sorta the
D:                  same? We don’t need to read Luna’s
D:                  story, we need to watch it!
0: 
N:        Our team looks doubtful, but Mr. Oz and Albert perk up.

D:                  I could see Luna obscuring the true
D:                  nature of the story to protect it
D:                  from the Nightmare King...
C: 15                         ALBERT                                  15
D:                  And tying it to Castle Nocturnia so
D:                  only a Dreamchaser could find it.
C: 16                         COOPER                                  16
D:                  Cool. So, how do we decipher a
D:                  story set in some windows?
C: 17                         MATEO                                   17

N:        Everyone groans, except Logan, puzzling over one window.

D:                  Hey Mr. Oz. Who’s that?
0: 
N:        He points to the one decipherable image in the FIRST STAINED-
N:        GLASS WINDOW: It’s MIGO, a sweet and adorable DREAM CREATURE.
C: 19                         MR. OZ                                  19
D:                  That is Luna’s best friend, Migo.
D:                  From the moment she dreamcrafted
D:                  Migo, the two were inseparable.

N:        Seeing the similarities between the Luna/Migo bond and their
N:        own friendship, Mateo and Z Blob exchange a glance.

D:                  Sadly, when Luna disappeared, Migo
D:                  did too.

N:        clouds fill the sky. Zian touches back down.
