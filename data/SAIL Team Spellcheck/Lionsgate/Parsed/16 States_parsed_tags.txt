0: S: EXT. FORESTED ROAD - EARLY MORNING
0: 
N: The grey gloaming of morning. A PICKUP truck pulls to the
N: side of the road at the edge of the WOODS. In the bed, an
N: adorable SPOTTED JUVENILE DOG YIPS with excitement.
0: 
N: A man who looks to be a HUNTER emerges from the truck with a
N: RIFLE and heads for the treeline. The excited young dog
N: jumps out and follows him.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. WOODS / GULLY - A SHORT TIME LATER
0: 
N: A perfect morning for hunting, good visibility and flat
N: light. The Hunter loads his gun, looking serious as cancer.
0: 
N: The spotted dog sniffs the breeze when-- A SNAPPING TWIG gets
N: their attention, the Hunter’s eyes dart to see--
0: 
N: A BUCK, oblivious to his presence, rooting around nearby.
N: It’s beautiful.
0: 
N: PAN back to the Hunter- taking in the sight, while the dog
N: stiffens at attention.
0: 
N: The Hunter studies the gorgeous animal closely, its
N: musculature highlighted by the early rays of then rising sun
N: when... A TEAR wells in his eye.
0: 
N: The Hunter returns his attention to the gun.   He flips off
N: the safety.
0: 
N: BACK ON THE BUCK, still unaware, when a loud GUNSHOT RINGS
N: OUT. The startled animal DASHES AWAY UNHARMED as we PAN BACK
N: to the hunter to REVEAL--
0: 
N: --A HUGE SECTION OF THE HUNTER’S HEAD IS GONE- the rifle
N: barrel still in his mouth as his body CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND
N: before a tree painted with his blood and brain matter.
0: 
N: The dog is completely unaware and DARTS AFTER the buck,
N: leaving us with the Hunter’s remains.
0: 
N: A ghastly and unforgettable image- the man’s lifeless EYE
N: looking to the skies. CAMERA TILTS UP, following his gaze, as
N: the bright white sky soon BLEACHES THE FRAME.

S: EXT. SUBURBAN MAIN STREET - DAY
0: 
N: Tall, gauzy, OUT OF FOCUS SHAPES undulate like stalks of corn
N: in a SLOW MOTION breeze.
0: 0:                                                          2.
0: 
0: 
N: Moving closer reveals them to be SMALL AMERICAN FLAGS, dozens
N: of them, gripped by HANDS both young and old -- held aloft
N: above a CROWD.
0: 
N: It doesn’t seem unusual the flags only have SIXTEEN STARS.
0: 
N: We move through this lyrical forest of red, white and blue,
N: over the heads of the SPECTATORS until we come upon a PARADE.
0: 
N: IN SLOW MOTION MONTAGE, we take in familiar images of HIGH
N: SCHOOL MARCHING BANDS and FLOATS...
0: 
N: ...MAJORETTES and REVOLUTIONARY WAR RE-ENACTORS...
0: 
N: ...VFWs and UNCLE SAM ON STILTS walk side by side as happy
N: MIDWESTERN TOWNFOLK cheer them on, lining the streets of an
N: average Midwestern town. And from the banners held by the
N: marching members of the ROTARY CLUB, it seems we are in a
N: place called WYNTON, ILLINOIS.
0: 
N: The pastoral imagery continues along suburban FRONT YARDS
N: populated by running kids passing houses draped in bunting
N: and other regalia. Golden hour paints it all in orange.

S: EXT. CONSTANCE HOUSE - DUSK
0: 
N: Outside one of these houses, on a quaint cul-de-sac, we catch
N: up with a FAMILY OF FOUR leaving their front door with
N: armfuls of dishes destined for their neighbor’s home.
0: 
N: APRIL CONSTANCE follows her youngest daughter, POSEY (8), out
N: the door. April has a bowl of POTATO SALAD and a covered POT
N: while little Posie lugs a tupperware CONTAINER, best she can.

D:           No that’s sideways... Do you have
D:           the cupcakes Josh?
0: 
N: Her husband JOSH clears the threshold with a plate balanced
N: on one hand and a GROWLER of beer in the other.
0: 
C:                     JOSH
D:           No- Bella does-     Bella? You comin’
D:           or what?
0: 
N: Josh looks over his shoulder to his older stepdaughter,
N: ISABELLA (14)-- bringing up the rear with a CUPCAKE PLATTER.

D:           Your mother wants to impress the

C:                     APRIL
D:           I’m just being nice!
0: 
N: POP-POP-POP-POP! A few TWEENS set off a HALF-MAT OF FIREWORKS
N: across the cul-de-sac, startling everyone.

0: 
S: EXT. JEN AND MATT’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
0: 
N: SPARKLERS and SNAPPERS occupy raucous little ones while a few
N: DADS toss some small FIRECRACKERS.
0: 
N: A classic SONG on the outdoor speakers as NEIGHBORS pick at
N: the potluck outlay. Neighbor dad MATT wears a baseball hat
N: that reads US BORDER FORCES. He unloads burgers and dogs off
N: the grill and onto platters held by April and Isabella.
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           So how you liking Wynton, Matt...?
0: 
C:                     MATT
D:           We love it so far. Work’s good,
D:           taxes are super low, people seem
D:           nice...
0: 
C:                     JEN (O.S.)
D:           April will you give me that and sit
D:           down already?
0: 
N: Matt’s wife JEN appears and takes the platter from her, her
N: 16 year old son, COLE, trailing behind her. Isabella
N: instantly notices him.
0: 
C:                     JEN (CONT'D)
D:           Isabella, this is Cole. He’s shy,
D:           but he sure is handsome isn’t he?
0: 
C:                     COLE
D:           Mom...
0: 
N: Cole rolls his eyes as the women laugh at him, but can’t help
N: but notice Isabella’s smile. The moment is soon broken by the
N: distant BOOM of FIREWORKS.
0: 
N: Jen claps her hands and SHOUTS to be heard by all-
0: 0:                                                            4.

D:           TIME FOR FIREWORKS! TIME FOR
D:           FIREWORKS!
0: 
N: The grown-ups begin to migrate to a corner of the yard,
N: leaving Cole and Isabella together.
0: 
N: An awkward moment between the teens, then--
0: 
C:                     COLE
D:           So... uh.. You going to the
D:           football game Sunday?
0: 
C:                     ISABELLA
D:           Um, probably, yeah...
0: 
C:                     COLE
D:           Maybe we should go together?
0: 
N: Isabella tries to play it cool as she blushes at this
N: unexpected moment.
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           I’m not shy.
0: 
N: Cole’s smile melts her a little. MUSIC SWELLS AS they
N: continue to flirt--
0: 
T:                                               SMASH CUT TO:
0: 
N: POP! BOOM! OOOH! AHH! PYROTECHNICS fill the skies as the
N: neighbors enjoy the COMMUNITY FIREWORKS filling the sky.
0: 
N: SCORE builds as we CRANE UP SLOWLY, revealing the GLOW OF THE
N: FIREWORKS ON THE TREETOPS...
0: 
N: CRANE UP continues as we go higher, FLASHES of colored light
N: illuminating the surrounding neighborhood and eventually--
0: 
N: --A LONG, LOOMING WALL OF SHIPPING CONTAINERS at the edge of
N: town, CUTTING THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE AND SNAKING INFINITELY
N: INTO THE DISTANCE IN EITHER DIRECTION.
0: 
N: PULL OUT CONTINUES as fireworks from adjoining towns can also
N: be seen in the distance- FURTHER ILLUMINATING THE SEEMINGLY
N: ENDLESS WALL--
0: 
N: MUSIC BUILDS as....

S: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET / PARK - AFTERNOON
0: 
N: A beautiful day. Leaves rustle on the trees of the quaint
N: street. Nothing could be more normal as we catch up with
N: April walking Posey through the neighborhood.
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           But Suzanne was your Grandmama’s
D:           name...
0: 
C:                      POSEY
D:           I still don’t like it...
E:               (then)
D:           And why do you call Bella “Bella”?
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           Because it’s short for Isabella...
0: 
C:                     POSEY
D:           You know why I like when you call
D:           me Posey?
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           Um... maybe because you’re pretty
D:           like a flower?
0: 
N: Posey laughs as they walk on.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. SUBURBAN PARK - DAY
0: 
N: Minuscule in the frame, they make their way across marshy
N: lowlands, passing a PARK. Jutting up from the nearby woods is
N: a municipal WATERTOWER- a familiar suburban sight.
0: 
N: Something draws Posey’s attention. She points.
0: 
C:                     POSEY
D:           Mommy look.
0: 
N: On the other side of the playground something moves in the
N: grass. Before any alarm can be raised, the YOUNG SPOTTED DOG
N: scampers into view. Posey laughs at his awkward gait.
0: 
N: April kneels down to accept the dog and it flops into her
N: lap. She SMOOSHES ITS FACE and it LICKS HER PLAYFULLY as she
N: notices his collar.
0: 0:                                                            6.

D:           Did you break out of your yard?
D:           Let’s find out who you belong to.
E:               (to Posey)
D:           You want to pet him?
0: 
N: Posey moves closer as April reaches for his collar, but
N: before Posey can pet him, the dog SCAMPERS OFF.
0: 
C:                     POSEY
D:           Hey! Come back!
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           Here boy-- come here--
0: 
N: He’s already too far to catch, running for the treeline.
0: 
C:                     POSEY
D:           Is he going home?
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           I hope so. I’m sure they’re missing
D:           him right now.
0: 
N: As Posey grabs her hand, April watches the dog head for a
N: GULLY by a THICK STAND OF TREES - which eventually consume it
N: in their shadows.

S: INT. CONSTANCE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
0: 
N: The family sits around a small table in the kitchen holding
N: hands as Josh prays.
0: 
C:                     JOSH
D:           Lord God and giver of all good
D:           gifts, we are grateful as we pause
D:           before this meal, for all the
D:           blessings of life that you give to
D:           us. Mindful of your continuous
D:           care, we are grateful for the
D:           blessings of this table.
0: 
C:                     EVERYONE
D:           Amen.
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           An extra prayer for the Conner
D:           family. That you may comfort them
D:           and love them during their
D:           hardship.
0: 
N: This is clearly a break in form and Josh squirms with
N: discomfort. He shoots a glare at April.
0: 0:                                                             7.

C:                     ISABELLA
D:           Something going on with the Conners
D:           mom?
0: 
N: April looks to Josh- she clearly wants to say something and
N: he’s not happy about it-- so he jumps in before she can.
0: 
C:                     JOSH
D:           They were neglectful, always were-
D:           now they’re dealing with the
D:           repercussions. End of story, now go
D:           on and eat.
0: 
N: April shoots a glance back at Josh as SILENCE falls over the
N: table and everyone eats. Eventually Josh changes the subject--
0: 
C:                     JOSH (CONT'D)
D:           I scheduled an extra practice
D:           Saturday by the way. Sunday’s gonna
D:           be a tough one...
0: 
N: April nods as the hush returns like a blanket of snow.

C:                     JOSH
D:           What’s the point of bringing it up
D:           is all? I mean thank goodness
D:           someone called it in, you know?
D:           Besides- who wants to talk about
D:           that stuff?
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           They know Mary and Dave’s kids. Do
D:           you think if we don’t talk about it
D:           they won’t notice?
0: 
C:                     JOSH
D:           There’s plenty of good things for
D:           them to notice. Do you know how
D:           lucky we are? To have all the
D:           things we have?
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           I know, but--

C:                     JOSH
D:           What we have is special. We are
D:           safe, we have security, a roof over
D:           our head, friends... Those are
D:           things that a lot of good people
D:           fought and died for in this
D:           country. Hell- their dad was one of
D:           them.

D:           Don’t you think I know th--
0: 
C:                     JOSH
D:           I’m just saying they shouldn’t ever
D:           forget that.
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           Of course not... but there’s
D:           nothing wrong with caring, Josh.
0: 
C:                     JOSH
D:           What? Like the Anderson Seven?
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           You know that’s not what I’m saying-

E:               (quoting something)
D:           “Let ‘em through, let ’em through-
D:           God told me to let ‘em through”
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           This is different.
0: 
C:                     JOSH
D:           Everything has consequences.
0: 
N: April looks at him with a slight unease. There’s something
N: she wants to ask.
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           It wasn’t you who called them in
D:           was it?
0: 
N: Josh deflates- just stares back at her.    But he doesn’t rush
N: to deny it.
0: 
C:                     APRIL (CONT'D)
D:           I mean, you wouldn’t do that but...
0: 
N: He declines to elaborate. He just sighs and exits, leaving
N: April equal parts guilty and unsure.

S: INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
0: 
N: A normal American grocery store. Normal enough. April moves

0: 
N: She picks up a dozen EGGS. Some CANNED GOODS. Some CELERY.
N: Inspects some APPLES when she’s joined by a FRIENDLY SHOPPER.

D:           No. It’s more like faith...
D:           Something to believe in. Something
D:           that keeps them going.
0: 
N: April searches for direction. It’s a moment that every parent

D:           Do you remember Grandma and

0: 
N: Nothing. She continues.
0: 
C:                     APRIL (CONT'D)
D:           That lake was pretty murky.
D:           Basically a big mud puddle really--
D:           and so many sunken trees at the
D:           bottom. Like- a giant trap for
D:           catching kids limbs. It’s a wonder
D:           they ever let us swim in it. As
D:           you’ll recall Grandma had a pretty
D:           wide definition on what was safe
D:           for children.

E:               (beat)
D:           Well one time, I must have been 6
D:           or 7, I was jumping off the deck
D:           into the lake with my cousins. Even
D:           Grandma said that that was too
D:           dangerous to do -so you can

D:           Well sure enough, my legs got
D:           caught in those limbs at the bottom
D:           and I was trapped. I couldn’t tell
D:           up from down and I was starting to
D:           panic. You know with my eyes
D:           clamped shut to keep out that muddy
D:           water. You know the way little kids
D:           do. The way Posey does.

D:           No. Those kids didn’t even notice I
D:           was gone.
0: 
C:                     ISABELLA
D:           So what happened?
0: 
C:                     APRIL
C:           I remembered something Grandpapa
D:           said to me. He said if you ever get
D:           in trouble underwater, open your
D:           eyes and swim toward the light.
D:           That’s what I did and I found my
D:           way out.
E:               (a smile, then)
D:           I made quite a show of it. Crying
D:           and screaming- snot running down my
D:           face. I was angling for a grilled
D:           cheese and tomato soup. Grandma’s
D:           cure for near-death trauma.
0: 
N: This jars a happy memory loose in Isabella’s mind.
0: 
C:                     ISABELLA
D:           Grilled cheese and tomato... I

0: 
N: UNITED STATES VECTOR CONTROL or USVC is printed prominently
N: on the side of one of the vans. Figures dressed in PPE SUITS

D:           To confirm or deny would violate
D:           the subject’s right to privacy.
0: 
C:                     COLONEL BEDFORD
D:           What we can say is we need to do
D:           our due diligence with people that
D:           had direct contact with the
D:           subject.
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           Meaning what?
0: 
C:                     COLONEL BEDFORD
D:           We’d just like to have you in, ask
D:           a few questions and do a quick
D:           test. The subject is not yet within
D:           the transmission window, so there’s
D:           nothing to worry about- but we are
D:           required to double check.
0: 
N: It’s a lot to take in.   She shoots a look to Josh.

D:           Can I?
0: 
C:                     MAJOR STENZ
D:           You could, but you’d need a lawyer
D:           to petition the court. And you
D:           would have to be kept under
D:           observation by a professional at
D:           your home at your own expense.
0: 
C:                     COLONEL BEDFORD
D:           It would take about ten days.

D:           Ten days?

D:           Bella-
0: 
N: Isabella clams up as April thinks. Ten days doesn’t sound
N: appealing. Unsure, she looks to her husband for guidance.
0: 
N: They share a long stare at one another, until Josh gives a
N: subtle shrug as if to say, “The easy way is better.”
0: 
N: April takes that in and finally says-
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           Wouldn’t want to waste the money...
0: 
C:                     ISABELLA
D:           Mom no. Josh, don’t let her-
0: 
C:                     JOSH
D:           It’s ok. She won’t be long.
0:

D:           It’s ok honey. I’ll see you soon.

0: 
C:                     ISABELLA
D:           Can we go with her?
0: 
C:                     MAJOR STENZ
D:           You won’t be allowed in, best to
D:           wait until she’s released...
0: 
N: Seated alone, April shares a fake smile for her family...

C:                     APRIL
D:           It’s gonna be okay honey.
0: 
N: The door SLIDES CLOSED. Josh heads back home, leaving
N: Isabella fighting back tears... looking around... embarrassed
N: because people might see.
0: 
N: She soon sees Cole- looking upon her with sympathy.   A moment
N: of hope as she works his way toward him-
0: 
C:                     ISABELLA
D:           What do I do? I don’t know what to
D:           do...

0: 
C:                     MATT
D:           Stay back...
0: 
N: She stops, confused.
0: 
C:                     MATT (CONT'D)
D:           I’m sorry about your mom, but you
D:           need to stay away now...

C:                        COLE
D:           Dad--
0: 
N: Matt stares daggers at Cole, who immediately backs down.
0: 
N: Isabella can’t believe her eyes. She looks to Cole who wants
N: to speak, but is clearly afraid of his dad.
0: 
C:                        ISABELLA
D:           Cole...?
0: 
N: He looks down, ashamed. Isabella is broken hearted, tears
N: flowing freely as Matt, Cole, Jen and the rest of the
N: neighbors back away from her...
0: 
N: ...leaving her increasingly alone on her own front lawn.

N: I/E. VAN - SUBURBS - NIGHT
0: 
N: Equally alone, April watches from inside the van as the
N: houses and businesses of her community pass by.
0: 
N: The van is amidst a convoy of USVC vehicles consisting of
N: local and state police, light military transports and three
N: additional USVC vans identical to the one April rides in.

S: EXT. U.S. VECTOR CONTROL CENTER 38 - NIGHT
0: 
N: The police vehicles peel off from the USVC convoy as they
N: enter a CAMPUS OF INSTITUTIONAL BRICK BUILDINGS, ringed in by
N: layers of FENCING AND CONCERTINA WIRE.
0: 
N: A closer look indicates the complex is a large midwestern
N: HIGH SCHOOL long-ago repurposed for USVC operations.
0: 
N: A sign reads UNITED STATES VECTOR CONTROL STATION 38 -
N: CHATHAM COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER.
0: 
N: April takes it all in as the vans pull up before an entrance,
N: greeted by four SMALL TEAMS of USVC PERSONNEL in PPE suits.
0: 
N: The doors of April’s van slide open and April looks to the
N: handsome USVC NURSE before her, greeting her with a smile.
0: 
C:                     MALE NURSE
D:           Hi. May I see your right wrist
D:           please?
0: 
N: April extends her arm. The nurse quickly affixes an ORANGE ID
N: BAND to her wrist.
0: 
C:                     MALE NURSE (CONT'D)
D:           Orange three. Don’t forget that.
0: 
N: She is led by one of the teams toward a large building.
0: 
N: She looks around to see others escorted from the remaining
N: vans. ONE IS THE FRIENDLY WOMAN who she talked to while
N: buying apples at the store.
0: 
N: ANOTHER IS THE OLD MAN from the register line.   They look as
N: freaked out as she does.
0: 
N: NEARBY, the USVC TEAM including the Colonel and Major, go
N: through a SECURITY LINE outside a DOOR.
0: 
N: Their items go through a MACHINE akin to an airport scanner
N: while they put their fingers in a TESTING DEVICE. GREEN
N: LIGHTS ALLOW THEM ACCESS through the door.

S: INT. PUBLIC HEALTH STATION - MOMENTS LATER
0:

N: retrofitted into a field hospital of sorts. A ROW of
N: aluminum-framed plexiglass COMPARTMENTS containing exam
N: equipment and institutional furniture fill the space.
0: 
N: The sterile and functional aesthetic is broken up by

S: INT. PUBLIC HEALTH STATION - PLEXI COMPARTMENT - LATER
0:

C:                     FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
D:           There we go...

C:                     DOCTOR
D:           It’ll be just a minute...
0: 
N: She picks up a TABLET and looks it over while April eyes a
N: familiar sight hung outside the plexiglass chamber--
0: 
N: A LARGE EDUCATIONAL MAP FEATURING NORTH AMERICA-- but MOST OF
N: THE STATES ARE BLACK except for the 16 STATES east of the
N: Mississippi River and North of the Ohio River which are red,
N: white and blue.

0: 
N: April smiles back.   The woman’s warmth is appreciated.
0: 
C:                     DOCTOR (CONT'D)
D:           I just have to ask the questions.
D:           Check the boxes. Part of the
D:           routine. Okay? I do this all day
D:           long. Did you touch any blood?
E:               (off April’s head shake)
D:           Do you remember if he coughed?
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           Coughed? I don’t think so...
0: 
C:                     DOCTOR
D:           Good. As you know, the condition is
D:           transmitted through blood contact.
D:           He is stage one and he had no open
D:           wounds, so unless he was aspirating
D:           blood particles and you breathed
D:           them in, there’s almost zero chance
D:           of transmission. Don’t worry,
D:           you’ll be mommin’ again in no time.

C:                      APRIL

D:           Two weeks ago. Just a home one...

D:           Good.

C:                     DOCTOR (CONT'D)
D:           My kids are both married off.
D:           Believe it or not, you’ll miss all
D:           the chaos once they’re gone...

D:           Are we almost done?
0: 
C:                     DOCTOR
D:           Two more questions. Are you

0: 
C:                        DOCTOR
D:              Twenty. None positive.

N: April notices a NURSE leading the APPLE WOMAN out of the
N: compartment next to hers. She gives April a smile and a
N: thumbs up as she passes.

D:              See?

0: 
C:                        DOCTOR (CONT'D)
D:              So-- Allergies?

D:              The field guys are a bit
D:              overzealous, sure-- But no one
D:              wants another Anderson Seven, you
D:              know? “Let ‘em through...”

N: A tiny BEEP and the centrifuge stops spinning. April looks
N: to the Doctor as she turns her attention to the computer.

D:              Ok... just have to-

N: She hits a few keys, CLICKS her trackpad matter of factly.

C:                        APRIL
D:              Ok let’s go. Last question?
0: 
N: No answer.    The Doctor is distracted by the computer.

C:                        APRIL (CONT'D)
D:              What’s the last question?     You said

N: NO ANSWER from the Doctor. April can’t help but notice she’s
N: no longer smiling.

D:           Can you just ask the question
D:           please? Doctor?
0: 
N: The Doctor PUSHES A BUTTON on the desk- it blinks silently.
0: 
C:                     APRIL (CONT'D)
D:           What’s that?
0:

N: and puts them on.

D:           Doctor?

N: and puts it on.

D:           What? What’s going on...? Tell me
D:           what’s going on...

D:           Hey! What’s going on? Talk to me...

D:           WAIT!   STOP! WAIT!!
0: 
N: No one answers. They continue to push her toward the gaping
N: maw of a FREIGHT ELEVATOR. April implores them for help.
0:

D:           Stop! I need to talk to somebody!

C:                     APRIL (CONT'D)
D:           SOMEBODY HELP ME!!!

0: 
N: April grabs Lynn and pulls her in the opposite direction when-

C:                     LYNN
D:           We hear you! We’re getting you out!

D:           April...
0: 
N: April doesn’t listen to her until--
0: 
N: A SCREAM from INLAND. The trees and looming skyline beyond
N: gives us little more than the sounds of agony and terror.
0: 
N: EVERYTHING STOPS as the dread sets in on the deported.   Then--
0: 
N: DOZENS OF INFECTED POUR OUT INTO THE OPEN. They are a crazed
N: horde of men, women and children- ghastly in appearance but
N: not undead. They are engines of rabid hostility unleashed
N: upon the deported. And someone just rang the dinner bell.
0: 
N: CHAOS. The living panic. It’s hard to see in the night as
N: they are quickly outnumbered. ATTACKED... BITTEN... SAVAGED.
0: 
N: Lynn and April clock this, but April won’t give up on freeing
N: the trapped.

0: 
N: POP! The back of his head BLOWS OPEN and he goes down right
N: in front of April.
0: 
N: Lynn drags April toward the water to follow the others when--
0: 
N: SPLASHES RIP ACROSS THE WATER-    PEOPLE GO DOWN as if SHOT.
0: 
N: A second later, the SOUND OF GUNSHOTS from across the river.
N: Distant MUZZLE FLASH is visible from atop the wall.
0: 
N: MORE PANIC as April and Lynn run from the river-- others
N: being CUT DOWN ALL AROUND BY BULLETS, THE INFECTED OR BOTH.
0: 
N: Amidst of the chaos, they stumble on GINNY, the little girl,
N: SCREAMING as an Infected ravages her DEAD FATHER. A moment
N: of shock before April scoops the girl up instinctively.
0: 
N: Clutching her hedgehog, Ginny screams for dad as GUNFIRE AND
N: MAULING continue all around. April follows Lynn best she can.
0: 
N: The mud is insanely slippery but they press on through a
N: VIRTUAL FOREST OF OLD RUSTY DECAYED CONTAINERS.

0: 
C:                       APRIL
D:           WAIT!
0: 
N: But it’s too loud for Lynn to hear and she disappears from
N: view. There’s no way for April to get away and--
0: 
N: An INFECTED WOMAN GRABS GINNY and April tries to pull her
N: back. At the same time, an INFECTED MAN reaches for Ginny -
N: The infected woman reacts by attacking the MAN VICIOUSLY like
N: a dog defending a bone.
0: 
N: April has a chance to get away, but finds herself FACE TO
N: FACE with TWO INFECTED. And just when it looks like she’s
N: done for--
0: 
N: CLANG CLANG! The infected are distracted by BOONE- beating a
N: rod of REBAR against the rusty steel of an old container.
0: 
N: The distraction is just enough to get their attention and he
N: CHARGES them-- whacking away with the rebar as April uses the
N: moment to get away.
0: 
N: She looks back to see Boone RUN IN ANOTHER DIRECTION and lead
N: the infected away. She absorbs this sacrifice for a moment
N: before continuing with Ginny in Lynn’s direction.

N: MOMENTS LATER, April scans for Lynn- looking around at the
N: carnage like a deer in the headlights. She’s quickly spotted
N: by some infected and before she can decide what to do-
0: 
C:                       LYNN (O.S.)
D:           APRIL!
0: 
N: April turns to see Lynn about twenty yards away on the FAR
N: SIDE OF A DEEP DRAINAGE RAVINE. She waves April over. Still
N: carrying Ginny, April immediately runs right at her as the
N: infected GIVE CHASE.
0: 
C:                       LYNN (CONT'D)
D:           C’MON!
0: 
N: April runs full out, but the infected are gaining.

0: 
0: 
N: As she draws closer to Lynn she can see the Ravine is
N: functioning as ersatz MOAT- bogging down other infected in
N: the mire of mud and urban runoff.
0: 
C:                     LYNN (CONT'D)
D:           Jump!
0: 
N: April has no choice- it’s jump or nothing.   And at the last
N: possible moment she LEAPS and--
0: 
N: OOOF! Ginny FLIES FROM HER ARMS to waiting Lynn as April
N: lands chest-first on the edge of the far side of the ravine.
N: Behind her, infected fall into the muck like rabid lemmings.
0: 
N: April’s feet dangle before the mired infected. Lynn is quick
N: to SNATCH HER WRISTS AND DRAG HER OUT TO SAFETY. They barely
N: get a moment before they hear a CRY FOR HELP FROM NEARBY.
0: 
C:                     MALE VOICE (O.S.)
D:           HEY!!
0: 
N: A MUD COVERED MAN struggles to get out of the ravine nearby,
N: repeatedly sliding down to several infected stuck in the mud
N: around him-- tirelessly thrashing in an effort to get to him.
0: 
C:                     MUDDY MAN
D:           HELP ME!! PLEASE!
0: 
N: The women rush to his aid when April notices IT’S BOONE.
0: 
N: This gives her brief pause- but of course her heart quickly
N: gets the best of her and she helps PULL HIM UP.
0: 
C:                     BOONE
D:           Jesus thank you! Thank you!
0: 
N: For the first time, they’re able to scan the horrific scene
N: resembling a bloodbath not seen since the Civil War.
0: 
N: Then April notices the ravine is filled with enough infected
N: to make a ramp of sorts for the coming horde.
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           C’mon!
0: 
N: Lynn scoops up April and they all TAKE OFF RUNNING as the
N: first of many infected get OVER THE RAVINE AND CHASE THEM.

0: 
S: EXT. OVERGROWN INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: April, Boone and Lynn (carrying Ginny) run full tilt through
N: the woods, half blinded by the darkness and further
N: handicapped by the thickening brush.
0: 0:                                                            40.
0: 
0: 
N: Their HEAVING BREATHS dominate all as they finally emerge in
N: a small CLEARING. In the lead, Lynn pauses to look around.
N: April and Boone follow suit.
0: 
N: Only then can they hear the SOUND of INFECTED scampering
N: through OVER BLACKTOP and GRAVEL.
0: 
N: It sounds like a lot of them and not seeing them makes it
N: more terrifying.
0: 
N: Lynn squints in the darkness and manages to spot something-
0: 
C:                        LYNN
D:           There!
0: 
N: What’s left of a COLLAPSED WIRE FENCE straddling the
N: overgrown shoulders of a driveway is their best chance at
N: finding a hiding place. They run for the pathway as the
N: SOUNDS of the infected draw CLOSER.
0: 
N: April presses on her ribs- a stitch she can’t stop to service-
0: 
C:                        BOONE
D:           See that!?
0: 
N: And as Boone HUFFS on his way past her toward--
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. INDUSTRIAL SILOS - PRE-DAWN
0: 
N: The first photons of morning have brightened the sky to a
N: dull blue, providing enough light to show us--
0: 
N: An old INDUSTRIAL AGRI-STORAGE FACILITY, surrounded by
N: FENCING and a LOCKED GATE. A ramshackle three story concrete
N: husk of a building with SILOS, it seems to have been
N: abandoned mid-renovation- judging from the missing windows
N: and overgrown construction equipment surrounding it.
0: 
N: Boone is first to the fence and LOCKS HIS HANDS TOGETHER to
N: offer Lynn a lift over.
0: 
C:                     BOONE
D:           Go over! GO.
0: 
N: Lynn needs no prompting to step into his hands and get
N: HOISTED to the top of the fence with Ginny in her arms.    She
N: latches on, the RUSTY top crossmember BEGINS TO BEND.
0: 
N: With no choice, Lynn lowers Ginny on the other side and rolls
N: off the rickety fence to safety.
0: 
N: APRIL IS THE NEXT TO BE HELPED OVER. As soon as her weight
N: hits the crossmember it SNAPS and the fence quickly SAGS.
0: 0:                                                           41.
0: 
0: 
N: INFECTED come into view- leaving Boone no choice but to climb
N: the wobbling unstructured fencing as the they close in.
0: 
N: He gets to the top as the infected arrive, but the fencing
N: sags BACKWARD- landing him right into the arms and mouths of
N: the ravenous infected.
0: 
N: HE SCREAMS as he’s eaten alive, letting go of the fence which
N: springs back up a few feet.
0: 
N: Lynn pulls Ginny’s face into her bosom and watches with April
N: as Boone dies as the accumulating infected PUSH ON THE FENCE.
0: 
N: They quickly RETREAT TO THE BUILDING, ENTERING THE OPEN
N: DOORWAY.
0: 
0: 
S: INT. SILO STORAGE BUILDING - MAIN ROOM - PRE-DAWN
0: 
N: Once inside, the winded women put down Ginny and look around
N: for stuff to block the entrance.
0: 
N: Lynn finds a STACK OF PLYWOOD.
0: 
C:                     LYNN
D:           Here!
0: 
N: She quickly muscles a sheet of plywood to the door. April
N: joins her to STAND IT UP AND BLOCK the entrance.
0: 
N: April spots a big heavy JOBSITE ROLLING TOOLCHEST and pushes
N: it up against the plywood.
0: 
C:                     APRIL
D:           Lock the wheels...
0: 
N: Lynn and April quickly LOCK OFF THE WHEELS and COLLAPSE to
N: the ground as the SCREAMS of Boone and the AGITATED HORDE
N: CONTINUE OUTSIDE.
0: 
N: For the first time, April can begin to absorb her new
N: reality. She’s in shock. Hyperventilating and COUGHING.
0: 
N: Gaining some wind, Lynn stands up and looks outside.   The
N: Infected remain on the other side of the fence.
0: 
N: The ones that can’t get to Boone are attacking each other
N: like rabid beasts.
0: 
C:                     LYNN
D:           Jesus they’re killing each other...
0: 
N: BLAAHK!! April, panting and still trembling with fear,
N: suddenly VOMITS- getting everyones attention.
0: 0:                                                             42.

0: 
C:                      APRIL
D:           Yeah.   Adrenaline...
0: 
N: April quickly concentrates on Ginny.

C:                     APRIL (CONT'D)
D:           It’s okay... we’re okay...
0: 
N: April truly wants to believe that.    She scoops up Ginny and
N: her Hedgehog.
0: 
C:                     APRIL (CONT'D)
D:           It’s okay, it’s okay...
0: 
N: Lynn assesses their surroundings, studying the pile of
N: PLYWOOD nearby. Then, through her heaving breaths-
0: 
C:                     LYNN
D:           I think we have enough wood to
D:           board this whole place up...
0: 
N: April realizes she may be somewhat in shock. She gets her
N: mind around the concept and agrees with a nod.
0: 
N: And as she joins Lynn rifling through the toolchest...

N: OLD TWINKIE, A CAN OF DOG FOOD, an old PAPER ROAD MAP...
0: 
N: A small campfire smolders beneath A MAKESHIFT CHIMNEY the
N: women have made from salvaged pieces of ducting.

D:           Are you okay?

D:           Fine honey- just a little cold...
0:

D:           I get cold sometimes is a--
0: 
N: BLAHHH! She VOMITS, surprising them both. Lynn looks to the
N: EMPTY BEDDING where April likely sleeps- then back at the
N: vomit. IT’S ALMOST ENTIRELY BLOOD.
0: 
N: She’s overcome with terror for Ginny.
0: 
C:                     LYNN (CONT'D)
D:           You need to get away from me.

0: 
0: 
N: APRIL AND LYNN ARE ENTANGLED and SCREAMING with intense
N: SAVAGERY-- For a moment it looks as if Lynn has turned.
0: 
N: Amid the insanity we see a SPLINTERED SCRAP of 2x4 has been
N: STABBED INTO APRIL’S CLAVICLE. It’s hard to comprehend what’s

D:           LYNN STOP!
0: 
N: That’s when April rears back- a MOUTH FULL OF BLOOD AND GORE
N: as Lynn DROPS TO THE GROUND DEAD- chunks of flesh GNAWED OFF.
0: 
N: APRIL IS NO LONGER APRIL. She has the CRAZED EYES OF THE
N: INFECTED and she is BURNING A HOLE INTO INNOCENT GINNY.
0:

N: Posey embraces her and they sit on the floor entwined,
N: quietly crying. It’s both beautiful and sad.
0: 
N: A loud KNOCK at the bathroom door startles them.

C:                     JOSH (O.C.)
D:           What’s going on in there?

C:                      ISABELLA
D:           She was playing near the creek and
D:           I was on my phone and she fell in.
D:           By the time I got her out she was
D:           covered in mud so we came home. I
D:           wasn’t paying attention. So I guess
D:           it’s...
E:               (beat)
D:           I wasn’t paying attention.
0:

C:                     JOSH
D:           And what happened to her jacket?

E:               (through door)

0: 
C:                      ISABELLA
D:           It was trashed from the water and
D:           the mud... It was getting too small
D:           anyways...

D:           Yeah well, now you gotta go buy her
D:           a new one... Pay more attention.
0: 
N: Josh OPENS the bathroom door to reveal Posey, FULLY CLOTHED,
N: STARING AT THE FLOOR.
0: 
N: Josh offers no affection or even a comforting word. They all
N: just stand there, horribly awkward.
0: 
N: Isabella breaks the moment when she puts an arm around Posey
N: and walks her to her room and Josh goes the other way.
0: 
N: Once at Posey’s bedroom, Isabella crouches down to follow up
N: with her sister. She looks scared and confused.

C:                     ISABELLA
D:           Everything’s gonna be ok, alright?

D:           So someone else found it and didn’t

N: It’s written in INDELIBLE INK on the INNER COLLAR. Just one

D:           You seen Cole lately?

C:                       MATT
D:           Good.
0: 
N: He stares, it’s intimidating. She walks away and scoots
N: Posey down the aisle with her.
0: 
N: Rounding the aisle and safely out of sight, Isabella takes a
N: DEEP BREATH and resets just as--
0: 
N: BLAHHHK! Posey VOMITS in the aisle.   PANIC. Isabella whips
N: back around to find--
0: 
N: NO ONE SAW.

0: 
N: The cashier doesn’t make eye contact as she robotically picks
N: up item after item and bags them. Things are going right.
0: 
N: Isabella’s eyes drift to the next cashier over to see MATT
N: WATCHING. Fake smile on his face, he’s too far to see the

N: UNSEEN READOUT SCREEN.

N: Isabella stumbles forward as if in a dream.     Looks out the
N: window to see the POLICE are outside.
0: 
N: Flooded with foreboding, she approaches the TRASH CAN next to
N: Posey’s bed and FISHES OUT THE DEVICE. She turns it over to

N: “POSITIVE. Call your local Vector Control hotline”

N: Isabella REELS. Posey is positive... The police are here for
N: her... and Josh is going to stand by and let the only person
N: that she has left be taken away.

D:           It’s just a disease. And given

D:           Surprise...

D:           They tried recovery camps early

D:           variables trying to keep virulent
D:           psychopaths under control for weeks
D:           on end... It always ended with them
D:           killing everybody.... And the
D:           numbers just kept growing. It
D:           wasn’t sustainable, not at scale
D:           anyway. Those sepratist wingnuts

D:           Plus the odds of surviving as an
D:           infected? Astronomical. You see
D:           them turn on each other? Eat each
D:           other? Meat is meat to them. And if
D:           you somehow survive being one and
D:           turn back? Your body’s been
D:           through the wringer and you’re

D:           survives it.
E:               (then)
D:           You were safe because you were
D:           trapped in here. Away from them,
D:           with steady food... but you

D:           For the range, home protection or
D:           something else?
0:

0: 
N: JOSH LOOKS AT THE BOX as if this small thing might overwhelm
N: him and cause him to dissolve into tears right there.

N: He places a hand on it- hoping it might break the spell.

C:                     JOSH
D:           Yeah, I’ll be honest with you--
D:           things have been tough and the kids
D:           have been going at it and I haven’t

0: 
N: MUSIC as Josh just notices and stares back at her for a

N: MUSIC AND SOUND CONTINUE as we find Bedford and April
N: charging forward through an ABANDONED BURNED OUT CATHEDRAL.
0: 
N: They’re terrified. Gulping air. Stumbling but moving fast.
0: 
N: Suddenly, we see why. A mass of infected BREAK THROUGH THE
N: DOORS of the cathedral and spill forward at monstrous speed.
0: 
N: A few yards AHEAD, April stops short and scans her
N: surroundings. No way out. They’re trapped.
0: 
N: No time to think because the infected are coming quick. Wide
N: eyed and cornered, April’s mind swims-- panic creeping up her
N: spine.
0: 
N: “Is she slipping into shock?” Bedford thinks as he looks at
N: her-- then desperately scans his surroundings.

N: They clamber up just as the infected reach them. Climbing the
N: rickety old scaffolding as fast as they can-- but they are
N: shaken as the vast tide of infected cause the whole structure
N: to BUCKLE as they IMPACT the foundation.
0: 
N: The structure starts to falter- but still the two climb
N: upward, hoping to reach a ROW OF WINDOWS at the top.
0: 
N: Soon they’re half way up.
0: 
N: SCREECH! Metal WAILS as the SCAFFOLDING GIVES WAY and falls
N: slowly to the ground like an ancient tree being felled.
0: 
N: April and Bedford ride it down and somehow manage to escape
N: the wreckage by JUMPING AT THE LAST MOMENT.
0: 
N: But now they’re BACK ON THE GROUND- SURROUNDED BY INFECTED.
0: 
N: WHUMP! A last piece of scaffolding falls onto the infected
N: and cuts a hole through the throng. Bedford and April seize
N: the opportunity and charge through the opening.
0: 
N: Once clear- they spot a SIDE DOOR and slip through.

S: EXT. GRAVEYARD - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: City of the dead. April and Bedford move through an avenue
N: cut through a collection of SMALL MAUSOLEUMS. They’ve managed
N: to pick up ANOTHER PACK OF INFECTED who pursue them like a
N: human avalanche.
0: 
N: They take a sharp corner- jump a short fence and find refuge
N: in one of the smaller funerary structures-- slipping inside
N: and crouched between TWO DUSTY COFFINS as a tide of infected
N: PASS BY OUTSIDE.
0: 
N: Nearly hyperventilating, April coughs out a few words.

C:                     BEDFORD
D:           We’ll wait here for now. Maybe

N: smile.

D:           My youngest. She hates graveyards.
D:           Used to make me go three miles out
D:           of my way just so we didn’t have to

C:                     APRIL (CONT'D)
D:           It wasn’t even a gothic place like

D:           More like a park really, but boy

N: door and pushing through fast. Too fast.
0: 
N: April and Bedford scamper to the back of structure
N: instinctively. TRAPPED AGAIN.
0: 
N: Too fast to think, no time for solutions. They’re flooding in
N: through the only exit.

N: The cause is lost. It’s obvious. It shows on both of their
N: faces.
0: 
N: TIME SLOWS DOWN, THINGS GROW SILENT and SOFT MUSIC PLAYS.

N: Bedford is about to give up when he looks at April- Her face
N: losing that unfaltering faith he saw as the tide of infected
N: begin to envelop them. But--
0: 
N: -another coincidence that brought them together? It has to
N: mean something... and he’ll be damned if he lets it end this

N: THE COFFIN AND PUSHES IT FORWARD-- Instantly creating a

N: his sickened body as they continue drifting past the docked
N: barges still teaming with Infected.
0: 
N: They watch from their safe vantage until--
0: 
N: CLANG! The barge SHUDDERS and April turns to see the front
N: has hit A STEEL PILING. As the current pushes the barge
N: onward, it can do nothing but PITCH AROUND the piling --
N: SENDING THE AFT TOWARD the infected infested docked BARGE

N: INSTANTLY THIRTY INFECTED GET ONBOARD the aft during this
N: moment as April and Bedford scramble to their feet.
0: 
N: And just as the barge hits the MAIN CURRENT and is pushed
N: downriver, the WAVE OF INFECTED HEAD ACROSS THE BARGE FOR
N: THEM.
0: 
N: There’s no way to win. Nowhere to go.   April looks for a
N: weapon.
0:

D:           Your daughter! She’s sick! There
D:           may still be time...

D:           Save her!

N: Bedford TIES OFF THE WEBBING. The tank glows red hot.
N: Bedford gets up to jump, BUT--
0: 
N: HE’S GRABBED AND QUICKLY ENGULFED BY THE HORDE.
0: 
N: April bobs violently as SHE’S SWEPT AWAY- only occasionally
N: getting a glimpse back at the now burning barge-- just enough
N: to see BEDFORD FIGHTING THE INFECTED and trying to muscle his
N: way to the water when--
0: 0:                                                          100.
0: 
0: 
N: BOOOOOOOOM! The tank EXPLODES and sets half the barge and
N: the entire night sky ALIGHT.
0: 
N: Shocked and horrified, April forgets to swim a moment as she
N: watches. However, she is fully clothed and resumes
N: struggling to swim as she moves downriver.
0: 
N: She GASPS while trying to remove her shoes and stay afloat.
0: 
N: With each attempt, she disappears under the water and
N: resurfaces. But the longer it continues, the longer she
N: remains under- until finally the water CONSUMES HER...
0: 
N: UNDERWATER- She is pulled ever downward, looking up at the
N: dull glow of light above. She fights the current and
N: exhaustion, swimming for the light, but gets no closer...
0: 
N: BACK AT THE SURFACE, we wait for her to emerge.    But she
N: never arrives...

N: biological barrier.
0: 
N: SHE IS MOTTLED AND ASHEN.   SWEATING PROFUSELY. DELIRIOUS.
0:

0:

0: 
N: A masked Josh takes a towel, moistens it and tries to cool

0:

S: EXT. RIVERBANK - MORNING
0: 
N: All is peaceful at the RIVERSIDE in the shadow of the wall.
0: 
N: RUSTY old CONCERTINA WIRE snakes along the shoreline. A few
N: long DEAD BODIES AND SKELETONS of infected victims that
N: managed to get across are tangled within it.
0: 
N: Eventually we reveal April- on her side, head on the shore,
N: the rest of her in the water.
0: 
N: She blearily comes to, BAG still slung around her, as she
N: struggles to her feet and assesses. No sign of the BARGE, no
N: sign of anything. All she knows is she’s on the side of the
N: river she wants to be on.
0: 
N: She limps toward the wall-- An interlocking construction of
N: cargo containers stretching up toward the sky like a giant
N: stack of legos-- hastily constructed, but no less ominous,
N: imposing and seemingly impassible.
0: 
N: And to make things worse--
0: 
N: A CRACK from the brush.    Then ANOTHER.
0: 
N: Fuck. They’re here.
0: 
N: And as she turns to face her fate, she is surprised to see--
0: 
N: DOGS. A small pack of muddy, half starved, FERAL DOGS.
0: 
N: They stare at her, sizing her up until-- they conclude she’s
N: not worth their time and turn back the way they came. As
N: they move, they REVEAL A DOG STANDING BEHIND THEM.
0: 
N: And although it’s muddy from its chest to its paws, the
N: MARKINGS on his face and coat make it clear...
0: 
N: IT’S THE DOG THAT INFECTED HER, no question about it. Still
N: alive, probably living off the corpses along the shoreline.
N: But how can he be on this side of the wall?
0: 
N: APRIL IS AGOG. There must be a way through.
0: 
N: And as April sets to following him--

N: submerged in mud- Up close, the wall is not in good shape-
N: Rusty and compromised from the weight.
0: 0:                                                         103.
0: 
0: 
N: She finds a dog trying to squeeze through A RUSTED HOLE of an
N: opening peeking above the mire. It’s not much of an opening,
N: based on the fact that even these emaciated dogs have trouble
N: getting through.
0: 
N: Watching the last dog disappear inside, April drops down on
N: all fours and puts her head through.
0: 
N: Inside the container it’s a world of blackness.
0: 
N: She pulls her head out again and considers the wall. Maybe
N: there’s a better option somewhere el-
0: 
N: SNAP!
0: 
N: She turns her head and SCANS THE TREES. In the distance- a
N: lone infected moves past.
0: 
N: It moves away from her, but its presence is enough to shake
N: her. She senses something is wrong. Quickly she moves toward
N: where it came from- toward the river.
0: 
N: The trees grow less dense and the dark nature of her
N: situation begins to resolve itself when she sees--
0: 
N: THE SMOLDERING BARGE HAS RUN AGROUND nearby and it’s full
N: compliment of infected are SPILLING OFF ONTO THE BANK. They
N: fall over themselves, some of them burned, attacking each
N: other and writhing like a tub of nightcrawlers dropped on the
N: deck of a fishing boat.
0: 
N: Gut punched, she watches them... until she realizes that in
N: fact, she is the one who is being watched.
0: 
N: THEY CHARGE TOWARD HER IN A SUDDEN TERRIFYING SURGE.
0:

N: Diving into the mud before the hole, she can’t move the earth
N: away fast enough. She scans the area for some sort of tool -
N: but this turn of the head reveals a desperate situation.
0: 
N: They are CLOSE. Too close. Moving fast. She has no time. It’s
N: too late.
0: 
N: Desperate, she lies on her belly and tries to wriggle her way
N: though. No longer able to stifle her panic, she SCREAMS as
N: she tries to force herself even an inch forward.
0: 
N: Suddenly something GIVES- and she SLIDES FORWARD.

0: 
N: INFECTED storm the hole, quickly cutting off what little
N: light leaks into the container. They are having as much
N: trouble bridging the hole as April had. She takes this slim
N: advantage to let her eyes adjust and reconnoiter.
0: 
N: She blinks to try to crack the blackness. She can discern
N: the crude volume of the space but little else. She whips her
N: head BACK to see-
0: 
N: TWO GLOWING RED POINTS from the far side of the container
N: draw her attention.
0: 
N: They are a DOG’S EYES, refracting the meager light.
0: 
N: They vanish quickly but she moves toward them- glancing back
N: just as the first infected MAKES ITS WAY THROUGH THE HOLE
N: behind her.

N: disgusting water without hesitation.
0: 
N: She wades forward, chest deep, into BLACKNESS-- stopping only
N: for a moment to gain a clue as to what direction to proceed.
0: 
N: A LOW SCRATCHING SOUND from the corner draws her. The
N: scratching is moving across the roof above her. Is it dog
N: feet? The sound their claws make walking on a hard surface?
0: 
N: She jumps as she BUMPS INTO SOMETHING--
0: 
N: A half-rotted DOG CARCASS bobs to the surface. She notices
N: there are SEVERAL MORE around her- Eyes rotted out, festering
N: with unspeakable corruption- they chide her silently.
0: 
N: How many of these poor creatures died in here swimming around
N: hopelessly until they drowned?

N: A new hell draws her eyes back to the hole she just passed
N: through - SEVERAL INFECTED HAVE MADE THEIR WAY THOUGH--
N: SLIDING INTO THE WATER and making their way toward her.

N: sound-- There has to be way through.

S: INT. SPACE BETWEEN CONTAINERS - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: When the containers settled into the mud, it opened a gap
N: between them, creating a narrow PASSAGE that April now finds
N: herself.
0: 
N: She pulls herself up into the narrow space. Desperately she
N: crawls forward on her belly.
0: 
N: But the infected are right behind her, coming into the
N: passage. Coming her way. Gaining on her!
0: 
N: April has to move faster but has no idea where she is headed.
0: 
N: At the far end of the passage, the space opens up and she
N: finds that she can actually stand up into a NARROWER VERTICAL
N: SPACE. She immediately understands where she is.
0: 
N: The corroded, failing structure of the containers has made a
N: gap-- leading her to a set of CONTAINER DOORS. She feels
N: around searching for what must be there.
0:

N: finds the door slightly ajar-- offering a space for her to

D:           she could make me a little sister.
D:           Every morning. It drove her crazy.
D:           She used to snap at me but it
D:           didn’t stop me. I just kept asking.
D:           But when they finally got around to
D:           it things were different then I
D:           thought. Instead of having someone
D:           I could play with or even a baby
D:           doll I could dress up-- I got a
D:           squirmy squeaker who was either
D:           puking or crapping on me. Mom was
D:           so busy she basically ignored me. I
D:           wasn’t old enough to understand--
D:           but I guess I was wondering how I
D:           fit in. One day when you were
D:           sitting in your high chair. Queen
D:           of the table spitting out anything
D:           Mom gave you. Eatin’ nothin. I made
D:           a funny face and you laughed. Boy
D:           did you laugh. I fed you something
D:           and down it went. Then I knew who I
D:           was. I was the only one who could
D:           get you to eat. It filled me up
D:           because you needed me.
E:               (then)
D:           And I kinda don’t know if you knew

0: 
N: The sound of bodies COLLIDING-
0: 
N: An infected WAILS HUNGRILY and noisily LUNGES.
0: 
N: CHAOS as the sound of WAILING and BODIES flailing in the
N: darkness denote a deadly encounter- but a HIGHER PITCHED
N: wail tells us it’s two infected FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER.
0: 
N: April MOVES AWAY from the scuffle, trying to stay hidden,
N: STOPPING as we hear the other two infected RIPPING THE HIGH
N: PITCHED WAILER APART.

0: 
N: Barely able to see, April has only her ears to illustrate
N: them digging into flesh and unzipping its belly. The
N: unmistakable sound of viscera SPILLING ONTO SHEET METAL and
N: cartilage popping under ravenous teeth.
0: 
N: It shatters April’s mind.   But it’s also one less infected to
N: worry about.

0: 
N: Rapturous light bathes April as she climbs through the hole
N: and rises to her feet in a container severely angled up
N: toward the opened sky.
0: 
N: UP THE SLOPE at the other end she can make out the open door
N: and through them she can see the source of the light. Without
N: taking time to judge the space she climbs up- slipping on the
N: steel floor but finding footholds where she can.
0: 
N: Nearing the top, a SCREAM from the other end draws her eyes.
N: She looks back to see-
0: 
N: ONE OF THE INFECTED HAS FOUND ITS WAY IN. Making a
N: miscalculation, she decides to speed up her ascent,
N: undermining her footing.
0: 
N: She grabs at a RUSTY PIECE OF BRACING, but it BENDS. She
N: LOSES HER GRIP- leaving the sharp piece of metal DANGLING
N: PRECIPITOUSLY.
0: 
N: To her horror she finds herself SLIDING DOWN THE INCLINE AND
N: INTO THE ARMS of her waiting pursuer.
0: 
N: At the last moment she KICKS OUT-- knocking the hunter off
N: its feet. She lands ON HER BACK with a THUD -- but seizes a
N: tiny moment in time to resume her climb.
0: 
N: But just then- the other infected ENTERS AND LUNGES.
0: 
N: IT HAS HER.
0: 
N: She struggles with it as BLOODY TEETH SNAP AT HER EARS while
N: the other one gets up and GETS A HAND ON HER. Adrenaline,
N: already coursing through her blood in pints, surges. She
N: KICKS AND PUNCHES CONVULSIVELY. It does nothing.
0: 
N: If only she had a weapon. She looks up to the dangling piece
N: of bracing and gives one more desperate effort to LASH OUT
N: and PUSH THEM BACK.

0: 
0: 
N: Then, putting her back against the slope - she PUSHES OFF
N: WITH HER LEGS and slides her body up the slope.
0: 
N: She REACHES UPWARD, STRETCHING FOR THE DANGLING PIECE OF
N: METAL BRACING.
0: 
N: She PULLS HERSELF AWAY from the grinding jaws and UPWARD
N: toward salvation.
0: 
N: The infected pursue her- but the slope and their diseased
N: minds inhibit their progress.
0: 
N: She’s so close to grabbing the potential weapon, she
N: stretches, SHE GRABS IT, but--
0: 
N: The last infected makes another spastic LUNGE-- landing a
N: hand on April’s pant leg and PULLING HER DOWN with the
N: BRACING IN HAND.

N: truck and OPENS THE DOOR TO get a good shot on Posey--
0: 
N: Pale, heaving for breath after a coughing jag, her

N: the gun barrel to her head and--

C:                     MATT (CONT'D)
D:           It’s the only way!

N: DIVES FOR MATT and-
0: 
N: COUGH!!!! Posey hacks into Matt’s face-   SPATTERING HIS FACE
N: AND SHIRT WITH BLOOD DROPLETS.
0: 
N: Dumbstruck with shock, he freezes-- calculating the
N: implications until-
0: 
N: COUGH!! She does it again-- this time SPATTERING HIS EYES.
0: 
N: He backs off- semi blinded and full of horror.

C:                     MATT (CONT'D)
D:           NO! No no no-- get it off!

C:                     MATT (CONT'D)
D:           Get something! Get it off!
0: 
N: Seizing the moment, April grabs Isabella’s hand and pulls her
N: back to the truck.
0: 
N: The neighbors can only stare as Matt grows ever more hopeless
N: and panicked- none more so than his own family.

C:                      MATT (CONT'D)
D:           Somebody help me! Why won’t anyone
D:           help me?!!
0:

N: if from a leper, but he keeps coming.
0: 
C:                      MATT (CONT'D)
D:           Help me!
0: 
N: Even Cole and Jen back away from him. Betrayed and
N: desperate, he rushes closer. Everyone lurches backward until
N: RICKY RAISES HIS RIFLE AND HOLDS HIM OFF.

0: 
N: As Matt suffers, Josh motions for Isabella and April to back
N: away toward the truck.
0: 
N: Isabella turns her attention to Cole. He looks at her, lost-
N: aware that she’s leaving but unable to go.

D:           He can survive it...

0:

N: April looks back at Posey as she sleeps. She reaches into her

0: 
N: Isabella looks out to the side of the road. To the passing

0: 
N: April reaches out and grabs Josh’s hand and squeezes it

0: 
N: He’s alarmed.
0:

N: with the blanket.
0: 
N: It’s effective but Isabella is terrified.

S: EXT. CHECKPOINT - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: The truck pulls up to a stop and a YOUNG SOLDIER approaches
N: them. Josh rolls down his window.
0: 
C:                      JOSH
D:           Problem?
0: 
N: Inexperienced, but trying to project an air of authority the
N: soldier leans forward.
0: 
C:                     YOUNG SOLDIER
D:           We have a vector protocol incident
D:           on the river, ‘fraid we’re closed
D:           here.
0: 
C:                     JOSH
D:           We’re just trying to get home.

D:           Where?
0: 
C:                     JOSH
D:           We’re heading to Cooper and they
D:           let us through the last road block
D:           a few miles back so we could get
D:           through before they shut down the
D:           highway. This is the only way to
D:           Cooper so...
0: 
C:                     YOUNG SOLDIER
D:           They didn’t send any information
D:           ahead about you so I really don’t
D:           know what’s...
0: 
N: He looks around to see if anyone outranking him is nearby to
N: give advice. From his expression, all the soldiers milling
N: around are just as inexperienced as him.
0: 
C:                     JOSH
D:           C’mon- it’ll be ok... I just want
D:           to get these sleepy girls home.

N: He considers it a moment.

D:           Then you know what I mean...
0: 
N: The soldier nods knowingly.    It looks like it may go Josh’s
N: way until--
0: 
C:                     YOUNG SOLDIER
D:           I’m gonna have to ask my Colonel.
0: 
N: Josh and April’s faces fall as the soldier backs away and
N: walks to a parked HUMVEE nearby.
0: 
N: The window opens and the body language of the soldier clearly
N: indicates he’s chatting with an unseen ranking officer until-
0: 
N: The humvee door opens and the young soldier steps away from
N: the car as an OFFICER climbs out of the passenger seat.
0: 
N: It’s STENZ. Former aide to Bedford.
0: 
N: Newly minted Colonel insignias are visible on his collar as
N: he heads toward them.
0: 
N: April notices him with shock. Josh and Isabella notice her
N: change in demeanor instantly. Tension begins to fog the air.
0: 
C:                     ISABELLA
D:           What? What is it?
0: 
N: April quiets her with a shake of the head, then turns away
N: and ducks down as Stenz is upon them.
0: 
C:                     STENZ
D:           What’s going on here?
0: 
C:                     YOUNG SOLDIER
D:           Just a family- They’re not locals
D:           so I’m not sure if they’re subject
D:           to...
0: 
N: Stenz examines the truck. April tries to bury her face
N: further. This action itself raises Stenz’s suspicion. He
N: silences the soldier.
0: 
N: Slowly, he walks around to April’s side of the vehicle eyes
N: locked on her.
0: 
N: Josh plays out the scenarios in his mind. His body language
N: seems to indicate that he may jump into foolhardy action
N: which April stiffles with a touch of his hand.
0: 0:                                                           122.
0: 
0: 
N: Isabella sinks back into her seat, overcome with doom.
0: 
N: Stenz arrives at April’s window and now he has a clear view
N: of her face. He can’t quite place her but she definitely
N: looks familiar.   He quickly becomes suspiscious.
0: 
N: He changes his focus, studying everyone-    Josh, Isabella, and
N: finally, Posey.
0: 
C:                      COLONEL STENZ
D:            Lower the window please.
0: 
N: Josh swallows hard as he can do nothing but comply. The
N: motorized window lowers and Stenz stares closely. He notices
N: the faintest trace of her wrist restraint peeking from under
N: the blanket.
0: 
N: He’s about to let it go when he HEARS SOMETHING.
0: 
N: An UNEARTHLY GUTTURAL RATTLE comes from beneath the blanket
N: that covers her face. He pulls back the blanket to see blood
N: spatter on Posey’s mouth.
0: 
N: Sudden alarm climbs up his throat as he looks to April,
N: FINALLY PLACING HER. But before he can act--
0: 
C:                      APRIL
D:            Wait-
0: 
N: April remains very calm and speaks to him in a serene voice.
0: 
C:                      APRIL (CONT'D)
D:            Just wait. Look at me.
0: 
N: Her incongruous tone holds his attention.
0: 
C:                      APRIL (CONT'D)
D:            You know me. You know who I was and
D:            where I was headed.
0: 
N: He does.
0: 
C:                      STENZ
D:            But...
0: 
C:                      APRIL
D:            You’re a colonel now. So you know
D:            what’s possible.
0: 
N: He’s surprised to hear that.
0: 0:                                                         123.

0: 
C:                     APRIL (CONT'D)
D:           We’re taking her east. To the
D:           mountains. I think you know
D:           where...
0: 
N: How does she know that? He looks to her as if to ask.
0: 
C:                        APRIL (CONT'D)
D:           Bedford...
0: 
N: He can’t believe his ears. But before Stenz inquire about him
N: further, April just shakes her head.
0: 
N: He understands, but a moment later, his face tightens up- his
N: thoughts returning to duty.
0: 
N: April notices and looks to her sleeping daughter.
0: 
C:                     APRIL (CONT'D)
D:           Now look at her.
E:               (firmer)
D:           Look at her.
0: 
N: Stenz looks back at Posey. Her bloodied mouth and shallow
N: breaths. Revulsion quivering in his eyes.
0: 
C:                      APRIL (CONT'D)
D:           She’s not a monster. Look at her.
E:               (then)
D:           She’s just a little girl.
0: 
N: Her voice takes on a tone moral certainty.
0: 
C:                     APRIL (CONT'D)
D:            She’s just a little girl.
0: 
N: Stenz tramples down a sudden compulsion to act and wipes his
N: mouth. He looks around, confused and bewildered.
0: 
N: What’s he going to do? It’s anyones guess. He looks April in
N: the eye and speaks and--
0: 
N: --starts BARKING at his surrounding underlings.
0: 
C:                     STENZ
D:           Open up! Let them through.
0: 
N: A cold bucket of relief douses the family. Josh throws the
N: truck into gear and pilots it forward.
0: 
N: MUSIC TAKES OVER as the truck goes through the checkpoint and
N: onto the quiet highway.

0: 
N: As they pass, April shares a glance with Stenz. Something
N: intangible in his eyes lightens her.
0: 
N: And as the car clears frame, WE SEE-
0: 
N: THE DOG-- emerging from woods. And as he trots back toward
N: the town, we can’t help but think about the implications of
