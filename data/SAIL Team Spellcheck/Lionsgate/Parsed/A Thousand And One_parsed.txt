T: FADE IN ON:
S: INT. JAIL CELL, RIKER’S ISLAND, WOMENS’ WARD - DAY
N: CHYRON - NEW YORK CITY, 1994 The grace of a little sun pushes through a barred window. It illuminates four brick walls aging in yellow paint, a toilet, and broken locker with the little desk affixed. A FEMALE INMATE is perched on one of two cots. She’s black, evidently pregnant and so world-beaten that her thirty years of age could pass for forty-five. She closes her eyes. From the opposite cot, another BLACK FEMALE INMATE leans in. She finishes a touch of lipstick delicately, the way one glamorizes a little sister. This is INES DE LA PAZ (22, Black). She’s slim, light brown, and enterprising enough to maintain the arsenal of goods crowding the locker top. There’s also a few posters and fashionable ‘fits strung on a makeshift clothesline. Ines doesn’t recognize how jilted the woman is as she rises, turning to clear the adornments on her wall. But then she turns back, feeling the burn of wanting eyes.
C: INES
D: Go ahead, take it.
N: The older woman giggles as snatches the beauty supplies scattered on the cot, dashing out before a change of mind.
S: INT. RIKER’S ISLAND, WOMENS’ WARD - LATER
N: Ines is back in her element, renewed in street clothes that pop. These pieces are humble, but boyishly on trend. She resigns herself to a bench while a MALE CORRECTIONAL OFFICER finishes processing. Sensing eyes on him, he glances up. Ines returns a devilish smile, as if the goal’s to keep his gaze.
C: CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
D: You’re free to go.
E: not falling, finishing
N: He hands over some scant belongings, including a winter coat.
C: CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
D: Every time I see you, you look different.
E: CONT'D
C: INES
D: Only on the outside.
S: EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET, MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - LATER
N: Ines sprawls the winter coat in her clutches as TWO STREET KIDS weigh the out-of-season bargain. A sea of socio- economically diverse FOOT TRAFFIC surrounds them.
C: INES
D: Right now, $50.
N: STREET KID #1 INES (CONT'D) Where we goin’ with that? What you gonna do this winter? STREET KID #2 INES (CONT'D) Let me see the label first - What you gonna do this winter, lay on your t-shirt? CLOSE UP on the palm of her hand as street kid #1 slides over some cash and subway coins.
C: STREET KID #1
D: That’s all I got.
E: O.S.
C: INES
D: Just give me the tokens -
E: O.S. returning quarters, dimes
S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, BEDFORD STUYVESANT - LATER
N: Ines is a force, rapturous and unfazed by the summertime stick as she jaywalks across the street. A few aggravated beeps. She sashays between cars like they don’t exist. In the backdrop behind her, LOCAL BUSINESSES ONE OR TWO GENERATIONS OLD. They’re not thriving but still standing.
S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD PARK, BEDFORD STUYVESANT - MOMENTS LATER
N: From outside the bordering gate, Ines approaches A GROUP OF CHILDREN–AT–PLAY (ages six to nine). One DAINTY LITTLE GIRL grabs her attention, braids and beads swinging side-to-side.
C: INES
D: Mama!
C: DAINTY LITTLE GIRL
D: Huh?
C: INES
D: A little boy named Terry out here?
N: The little girl shakes her head.
S: EXT. BASKETBALL COURTS - LATER
N: Ines halts FOUR MALE YOUTHS engrossed in a half court game.
C: BOY 1
D: He ya man?
C: INES
D: He’s six.

D: She mean one of Janie’s kids.
E: heading back to the court
C: BOY 1
D: Oh, they not over here.
C: INES BOY 2
D: You see him outside? Nahhh...
C: BOY 3
D: Check on Trinity -
S: EXT. WOMENS’ SHELTER, TRINITY AVE - LATER
N: Idle chitchat with LOITERING RESIDENTS - a few old friends - keeps Ines busy. However, she’s distracted by every car, NEIGHBORHOOD ADOLESCENT, and ADULTS that travels by. She plops down on a hydrant in defeat. Growing limp, she pulls out a Newport cigarette. Her ears perk up when THREE TINY BOYS start yapping near the corner.
S: EXT. BODEGA WALL, THE CORNER OF TRINITY AVE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Ines creeps over, staring down at one child in particular. He’s centered between two other boys, MICHAEL H. (7) and SHAWN (8) eating Marinos and jumbo icees. She smiles, almost too shy now to speak.
C: INES
D: Little bit. You don’t hear me calling you?
E: then
C: MICHAEL H.
D: Yeah.
C: INES
D: It’s him I’m talking to... Remember who I am?
N: TERRY (6), the tiny brown child she’s been looking for, barely looks up, nodding dismissively.
C: INES
D: Let me see your eyes.
E: CONT'D
N: He shrinks further into the bodega wall.
C: SHAWN
D: He not gon’ answer, Miss.
C: INES
D: What’s your name?
E: relenting
C: SHAWN
D: Shawn.
C: INES
D: And you?
C: MICHAEL H.
D: My name Michael “H” - there’s two of us...
N: She peers back at Terry, who eases with the heat off him.
C: INES
D: Let’s keep this between us, a’right?
N: INES (CONT'D) SHAWN & MICHAEL H. Don’t tell anybody I came by. (uncaring) Okay. She hands Shawn and Michael a little change for the store.
C: MICHAEL H.
D: You’re pretty.
C: INES
D: I’m gonna be around more often. Hear that, T? I just wanna see how you doin’.
N: Terry’s eyes glaze over.
C: INES
D: I’ll see y’all around.
E: CONT'D
C: SHAWN
D: Bye!
N: Terry’s the first to run off. The other two follow behind.
S: EXT. PARK - DAY
N: Terry’s getting on the monkey bars when he spots her. Ines on a bench, prioritizing hip hop magazine THE SOURCE over periodicals. Ines waves... he doesn’t.
C: INES
D: Hey!
N: From Terry’s direction, we hear a scuffle -- He’s fallen to the ground, still kicking defensively at Michael. His foster mother MS. JANIE (late 40s) intercedes, yanking Terry up.
C: MS. JANIE
D: Aye, none of that!
E: O.S.
N: Ines resists the reflex to step in... FOSTER SISTER MS. JANIE (CONT'D) They pulled him down! Okay, let’s go. Everybody!
C: MS. JANIE
D: If y’all don’t know how to act, you can stay inside!
E: CONT'D over fuss and moaning
N: The fussy group grabs their belongings. Ines does too.
S: EXT. FOSTER HOME - LATER
N: Ines settles at a bus stop across the street observing the children file into the house. As if he feels her presence, Terry sneaks a glance Ines’ way. He’s then yoked inside.
S: EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY
N: A yard full of CHILDREN engaged in recess. Spotting TWO TEACHERS in the yard, Ines is less brazen in her attempt to get the attention of Terry’s foster brother, Shawn.
C: INES
D: Shawn!
E: low, waving
C: SHAWN
D: Huh? Oh, hi.
C: INES
D: Where ya friend at?
C: SHAWN
D: He not starting school.
C: INES
D: Why?
C: SHAWN
D: I’m not telling you!
C: INES
D: Wow, it’s like that now?
C: SHAWN
D: What you gon’ give me if I do?
N: Shawn looks over at the pack of SOUR POWER STRAWS sticking out of the brown paper bag in Ines’ hand.
C: INES SHAWN
D: That one. Here.
E: CONT'D cross
C: SHAWN
D: He in the hospital.
E: CONT'D
C: INES

D: He fell out the window and hit his head -
E: munching
S: INT. RECEPTION AREA, SHITTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
N: A FEMALE RECEPTIONIST BANGS the phone receiver down. Ines arrives to the desk ready to charm, a cute Teddy in hand.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: Can I help you?
E: unenthused
C: INES
D: I believe my son is here.
N: Other lines ring away, unanswered. The desk is swarmed in paperwork. The waiting room itself is filled with VISITORS, eager to be assisted by understaffed personnel.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: What’s his name?
E: searching
C: INES
D: Terry.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: Last name?

C: RECEPTIONIST
D: We have a Terrance Wallace here. Is that who you’re looking for?
C: INES
D: Yes.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: Do me a favor and fill this out?
N: She picks up the sign-in sheet, handing it over to Ines.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: I need your driver’s license or another form of ID. You said you were who again, his sister?
E: CONT'D
C: INES
D: Damn, I left my wallet at home. Can I come back?
E: lying
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: Visiting hours end at ten.
S: INT. SHITTY HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: INES POV on the officials still in conversation with Janie. She’s settled in a chair beside SHEILA (85) who’s snoring her life away. She casually removes the woman’s visitor’s tag.
S: INT. TERRY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER
N: Donning Sheila’s tag, Ines makes herself at home in the chair across from Terry’s bed.
C: INES
D: You want one?
N: She sticks out a pack of NOW-OR-LATERS. Terry turns it down. She takes one for herself.
C: INES
D: Heard you fell. Let me see?
E: CONT'D
N: Terry pokes out his scabbing lip.
C: INES TERRY
D: It hurt? Uh uh --
E: CONT'D
C: INES
D: You could’ve died doing something like that...
E: CONT'D
N: Terry shrugs, fiddling with action-figures from the bucket of hospital toys, ignoring a small Teddy bear next to him.
C: INES
D: You look just like my sister.
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY
D: No, I don’t -
C: INES
D: What, you don’t believe me? See look.
E: cheesing digging into purse
N: Ines retrieves some photos in her purse, placing them in his eye line. On top of the pile, the image of a HANDSOME BLACK MAN (20s) with a scribble “LUCK ‘92” in the corner. She peels it back, revealing a shot of TWO LITTLE BLACK GIRLS (6,8) with an ELDERLY COUPLE. Renee’s hair is in it’s natural state, a trendy style fit for 70s-era little black girls.
C: INES
D: That’s me and Reneé.
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY
D: Why her hair look like that?
C: INES
D: It was fly back then.
C: TERRY
D: Where she at now?
C: INES
D: I don’t know. Can’t find her. But I found you!
E: then
N: A moment. She looks down at the neglected Teddy bear.
C: INES
D: What’s wrong with the one I gave you?
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY
D: It’s corny.
C: INES
D: Well buy ya own damn toys then. What you like?
E: snatching the Teddy up then
C: TERRY
D: Power Rangers.
C: INES
D: Tell me more about your foster mother. You like her?
N: Terry’s shrug is ambivalent.
C: INES
D: Pro’ly gone now anyway.
E: CONT'D
N: She leans into the bed. Terry squints at the pain of his injury, but keeps playing.
C: INES
D: They tell you anything about me?
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY
D: That you left me on a corner.
C: INES
D: ...Why would they tell you that? Why the fuck would they go and tell you some shit like that?
N: A FEMALE NURSE steps in, but stops short when she sees Ines.

D: I’m sorry, I just need to check his temperature.
C: INES
D: Get that outcha head.
E: to Terry

D: I thought visiting hours ended early today.

C: INES
D: Don’t worry, I’ll be gone soon.
S: EXT. G’S UNIQUE BEAUTY SALON, BEDFORD STUYVESANT - DAY
N: GLAMOROUS BLACK WOMEN, depicted in the awning, gaze down at GEE (late 30s) like guardian hood-angels. The plump salon owner, doesn’t hide his disdain when Ines arrives.

D: Ain’t no damn way you coming back up in here.
C: INES
D: Why not?
E: stepping forward
C: GEE

S: INT. HALLWAY, CHILDREN’S WARD - LATER
N: Ines sneaks through the quiet hallway, stopping when she lands outside of Terry’s room.
S: INT. TERRY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Ines sneaks a Blue Power Ranger toy between the sheets. His chest continues to rise and fall without a stir.
S: INT. TERRY’S HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER
N: Ines, on a bench at the opposite end of the hall, observes Terry’s examination by a DOCTOR. When he sees her, she waves. Terry allows the doctor to check his ears with an otoscope. And then... discreetly... he wiggles a few fingers back. Ines smiles.
S: INT. TERRY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
N: Terry is back in his street clothes watching cartoons next to half eaten breakfast. He’s rocking less bandages now. A few rhythmic knocks. Ines is at the door with a Red Power Ranger toy in hand.
C: INES
D: Look what I got.
S: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER
N: Terry and Ines on a corridor bench. He knocks his action figure into hers, knocking it down to the floor.

D: We going again.
E: nods
C: INES
D: In a sec. Wanna split this?

S: EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Ines holds hands with Terry, strolling.
C: INES
D: T, um... I think they gon’ move you again. In case you don’t see me for awhile, I wanted to come say bye.

C: INES
D: It’s not that simple.
N: They reach the doorway to his room.
C: INES
D: I’ll see you soon, a’right? Chin up.
E: CONT'D releasing his hand
N: He leans his wait against the wall, struggling to hold on to whatever he’s bottling up.
C: TERRY
D: ...Why you keep leaving me?
C: INES
D: You think this don’t bother me too?!
N: Seeing the doubt on his face, Ines gets down on a knee, eye to eye with him. Terry allows her to embrace him.
C: INES
D: It’s not me, I promise. These people don’t a give a fuck without a check.
E: CONT'D
N: She studies the foot traffic in corridor. Then, she spots it - the EMERGENCY EXIT a few yards the opposite way.
C: INES
D: What time ya case worker get here?

C: INES
D: ...No harm in that.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. STREET CURB - LATER
N: Terry’s eyes travel among the PEDESTRIANS moving about, then up Ines. She’s paralyzed in fear.

C: INES
D: He’ll do whatever the fuck he wants!

C: INES
D: Don’t let nobody push you around like that again. Hear me?
E: CONT'D tossing trash
C: TERRY
D: Yes.
N: Terry forces a brave face as Ines drapes him in her windbreaker, adjusting it to look less silly. TERRY’S POV as Ines reveals a reassuring, magical, smile. She yanks Terry’s hand, weaving between paused traffic until they reach a BLACK GYPSY CAB.
S: INT. BLACK GYPSY CAB - CONTINUOUS
N: She ushers Terry in.
C: INES
D: Go.

C: CABBIE
D: The bridge is closed.
C: INES
D: - That’s fine, take tunnel.
N: He complains under his breath, turning the radio up as Ines rummages through her bag for loose cash. She sneaks a look at Terry who’s slumped against his window.
C: INES
D: You sad to leave Brooklyn?
E: CONT'D
N: Terry nods, no... Collecting enough to cover the fare, Ines exhales and rolls her window down. LATER: Then Terry sees them for the first time... the skyscrapers that define the city’s center. He listens to the SOUNDS OF MANHATTAN; the boisterous noise has its own melody. Street scenes passing Ines’ window BLEND TOGETHER IN A DASH OF COLORS, as if moving at the speed of a subway car.
C: TERRY
D: They touch the clouds?
N: Ines leans over to see his view.
C: INES
D: Almost.
C: TERRY
D: Can we see all of it?

C: INES
D: What you wanna eat, boo?
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY
D: Cap’n Crunch.
C: INES
D: I don’t have Captain Crunch. How ‘bout cinnamon waffles?
N: Terry’s still glued to the muted TV screen. Ines brashly switches it off, pulling a box of waffles out the freezer.
C: TERRY
D: We gonna get in trouble?
C: INES
D: When I was your age, I ran away all the time. All they do is check the neighborhood, subways and schools... Not one foot is coming over that bridge.

C: INES
D: You hear?
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY
D: Mhm.
N: SOUND: Heavy feet speeding down the staircase. In pops RUDY (30), a local jack-of-all-seedy-trades who owns the place. He halts in his tracks, startled to see the kid.
C: INES
D: Hey Rudy.
C: RUDY
D: Who’s this?
C: INES
D: My baby.
N: He nods, not fully at ease, but moving on the fridge. TING! from the toaster. Ines gets up again. She lays the plated cinnamon waffles out on the table, then pulling a carton of Cookies ‘n Cream from the freezer.
C: INES
D: You want ice cream with yours?
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY
D: Yeah -
S: EXT. LIVING ROOM, EVERYBODYHOUSE - LATER

N: Rudy leans his weight against a chair, half looking out front, half keeping eyes on Terry and Ines. Ines sits on top of an old cabinet across from him, smoking. Terry’s curled up on the couch. He follows Rudy’s cadence as he eases back up, locking troubled eyes with the child.
C: RUDY

C: INES
D: It’s always changing...

C: INES
D: ...Why ain’t you speak up?
E: to Terry
C: DAVITA
D: Shy... Ha! Look at that.

S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, LOWER EAST SIDE - DAY
N: Ines and Terry stroll towards Rudy’s with bodega goods in hand. He’s masked by a cheap firefighter hat and toy sunglasses. He pulls the eyewear down some, examining the diverse blend of neighbors sprinkle the sidewalk - immigrant, hipster and a few yuppie-types.

C: INES
D: What you scared everybody’s gonna see? See that tall one over there? That’s the Empire State Building. “Empire’s’ like our way of saying, ‘This is the greatest place in the world’. Why you think that is? Why you think so many people love it here? If they can be anywhere else. Aight, look down. You see those two tall buildings that look alike?
E: CONT'D then no response
C: TERRY
D: I think so.
C: INES
D: That’s the Twin Towers. You see how one’s a little shorter. It’s a way of saying, we’re all the same, but still a little bit different, you know?

N: Terry, in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL UNIFORM, enters the sounds of ELEVATED VOICES - but things quiet down as he shuts the door. Sitting at the kitchen table, MARCEL ‘LUCKY’ DIAZ (26) turns to him - a handsome but scruffy-looking man. He’s the same man from the photo Ines first showed Terry in the hospital.

C: INES
D: Lady across the hall walks him home for me. Terry, I want you to meet Lucky.
E: to Lucky then

C: LUCKY
D: What’s up, little man?

Ines grips him even harder for the second horn, thrust and release... Despite her enthusiasm, Lucky pulls away prematurely, leaving her alone on the bed. There’s just not enough life back in him yet.
C: LUCKY
D: Where was he before?

N: She nods, no.
S: EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING, ENTRANCE - DAY
N: Ines and Terry, buried in winter coats, carry grocery bags with zombie-like energy. Just as they reach the steps, the roar of a motorcycle hits the block. Showman Lucky, more alive and refreshed, rounds his way towards the building. He catches Ines’ blushing at the looks of her NEIGHBORS.

S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, HARLEM - MOVING - LATER

N: Quick glance at her back side.
C: LUCKY
D: Do me a favor, walk on this side of me.
E: CONT'D

C: LUCKY
D: That’s not true. Yo shake that off. You’re a blessing. For your mom especially. Everything’s just complicated.

D: What do two crooks know about raising a family?
N: She playfully pops him in the shoulder.
S: EXT. BASKETBALL COURT, NEIGHBORHOOD PARK - DAY

They’re surrounded by a small cluster of NEIGHBORS, still in “wedding attire” as if fresh from the courthouse. Terry takes in the collision of music, noise and people interacting; even voices echoing from a car zooming by. Lucky spots Terry off to the side. He steps away from Ines, kneeling down beside the child.
C: LUCKY
D: T, your mother’s my wife now, but I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that I’m here for the both of you. We’re blood now. You scared I’m gonna take her away from you?

They’re all on bikes - taking ownership of their streets. A few VOICES echo from out the windows, friends stuck at home. Like Lucky’s chain on his neck, Terry gleams more than ever before.

D: She used to work at this coffee shop that closed down a few years ago. I get my hair cut right across the street, so one day, I see her and I’m like “Who’s this fly shorty in the window?” I go in. Order a bagel or whatever. I’m sitting down but still not really sure how to kick it.

C: TERRY
D: Have I ever?
C: LUCKY
D: No, but I’m not stupid. A lot of times it’s not even you, it’s the company you keep. Took me too long to learn that. Nothing worse on a man than not being able to provide for his own family. Keep the power you have over your life.

C: KIM
D: Listen, I’m in New York. I came to get you, but I stopped by the home and nobody knows where you are.
T: INTERCUT:
C: TERRY
D: I’m at a payphone.
C: KIM
D: Want to meet me back here?
E: O.S.
C: TERRY
D: Okay.
C: KIM
D: Okay. I think you should stop by the house first... Pick up any last things you want to take with you...
E: O.S.
S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MOMENTS LATER
N: Terry gazes down the long avenue. Heading for the curb, he waits for a car to pass. He drops his skateboard and kicks away from the QUIET sidewalk...
S: INT. LIVING ROOM, INES’ APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: When Terry steps in, we see the figure of Ines packing a few items into a garbage bag.
C: TERRY
D: Ma?
N: Ines pauses momentarily, then continues on. She’s cut her hair into a shorter pixie style, natural texture competing with remnants of relaxer.
C: INES
D: Hi, Terry.
C: TERRY
D: What are you doing?
C: INES
D: I left some things.
N: Terry tries his best to not side-eye. She continues packing.
C: INES
D: Don’t stand there looking over me. I know they already got to you so... feel free to run along.
E: CONT'D
N: He takes this in.
C: TERRY
D: But can we talk?
C: INES
D: Talk about what?
C: TERRY
D: Are you serious right now?
C: INES
D: Fine, you wanna talk? Let’s talk.
N: Ines drops the bag, sauntering over towards the table. Terry joins, but barely sits down before...
C: INES
D: - Fetch me my Newports.
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY INES
D: You were just over there - Over on the stand.
E: CONT'D dismissive
N: Terry complies begrudgingly - some things don’t change. He returns, slapping the cigs and lighter down on the table.
C: TERRY
D: Is all they’re saying really true?
E: CONT'D
C: INES
D: What you want me to say? That I fucked up? Yeah I fucked up... but life goes on, so.
C: TERRY
D: ...As long as it’s your call -
C: INES
D: - Did I make the choice or did you? Standing there in that hospital.
C: TERRY
D: Thinking you was my fucking mother!
C: INES
D: Don’t you raise your voice at me. I’ll still knock your narrow ass down -
C: TERRY
D: - Did Lucky know?
E: resettling
C: INES
D: Yeah he knew. Didn’t agree with it, but he knew.
E: reluctantly
N: Ines puts the cigarette out on her ashtray.
C: TERRY
D: So why’d you do it -
C: INES
D: I don’t know why, T. I don’t know why I did what I did.
E: MORE
C: INES
D: It was just a little thing that became something else...
E: CONT'D
N: Silence...
C: TERRY
D: ...And that makes it right?
C: INES
D: - Oh shut the hell up! Who made you the chief of right and wrong? You think I don’t have feelings too? Like I didn’t spend all those years taking care of you? - Who the fuck was there to ever take care of me?! You want hear “sorry,” but who’s gonna say sorry to me! God forbid I stand up for anyone else, let alone Ines, you the only we get to feel sorry for.
E: then then
N: Ines finally pulls out a cigarette. Terry gives her the chance to calm back down.
C: TERRY
D: Did you lie about all of it?
N: She thinks, pulling out another cigarette.
C: INES
D: Not the part about loving you, no. Not that you ever cared.
C: TERRY
D: Don’t put words in my mouth -
C: INES
D: Please, nobody gives a shit about black women ‘cept for other black women and even that shit is messy -
C: TERRY
D: - That’s not true!
C: INES
D: - You didn’t give a damn unless you needed me! Not just you, everybody!
N: The sound of a siren elsewhere spills in.
C: TERRY
D: - You were my mother! Now how am I supposed to feel?
N: Resettling by the window, Ines sees a few nosey neighbors gathering across the street.
C: TERRY
D: They not gon’ let you get away.
E: CONT'D
C: INES
D: I’m not going to jail... I’ll miss this smelly little fucked up city. Was only a matter of time.
E: then
C: TERRY
D: Before what?
C: INES
D: Before I figured out that New York lied. Letting us think it was anymore special or different than anywhere else.
E: thinks, then
N: Terry ponders this over.
C: TERRY
D: You never loved me... I was just supposed to replace somebody else.
E: tearing
C: INES
D: That’s really what you think of me? Go through all this, cause of that? I loved you! I tried to tell you, once... but I was too scared to lose you! ...I never left you on a street corner, Terry. I’m the one that found you. You were too young to remember, but I sat with you outside my shelter for hours. In case anyone showed up. Then ACS came. I heard you got placed in some home nearby. I got locked up again... But couldn’t get you off my mind... I am sorry, T. I just wanted to look out for you.
E: a moment then then then MORE
C: INES
D: Make sure you didn’t chewed up by the system like I was. Cause lookin’ at you, I saw myself... Maybe you would’ve found a better home. I didn’t want to take the chance... I was lonely. And I saw someone who needed me... But maybe I’m the one who needed you. Someone to love me. But I don’t want it anymore, not if it’s based on a lie, not if being loved by you or anybody else means not lovin’ myself.
E: CONT'D then then
N: Ines resettles in the chair, soothing some angst.
C: INES
D: They can call me whatever they want. I already know half the shit they gonna say and guess what, I still won. I WON! ‘Cause I know you’re gonna be somebody! Whether or not anyone else wants to see that or see ME, I know who the fuck I am!
E: CONT'D then
C: TERRY
D: And who am I now, huh?! When was I supposed to get the chance to decide that for myself?
C: INES
D: Who are you Terry? What kind of man did I teach you be? Somewhere deep down I hope you know the answer to that.
C: TERRY
D: I don’t...
E: choking up
N: Terry wipes his tears, finally beginning to relieve all that’s tensed up inside of him.
C: TERRY
D: I wish I didn’t know. I wish you did a better job keeping that whole lie to yourself. I wish it could’ve continued, so we
E: CONT'D then
C: could’ve continued. I wish...
E: MORE
C: TERRY
D: I wish I knew how to be better to you, so you never felt like you had to leave me alone. I’m scared that one day I won’t be able to come home anymore. One day I’ll show up and it’ll be like we never happened. Like this wasn’t our home, our living room. I miss laying in my own bed. The one you made for me. Where’s home for me now, Ma?
E: CONT'D then then then
N: Ines remains quiet as Terry stands.
S: INT. TERRY’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Terry gathers his own belongings.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Making his way out, Terry beholds Ines at peace on the couch.
C: TERRY
D: ...War?
C: INES
D: What’s that?
E: not processing
N: He plops down beside her, then reaching over to drag the getaway bag to their feet.
S: EXT. INES’ APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
N: Terry steps out first, then Ines. INES POV on A GROUP OF NEW YOUNG WHITE NEIGHBORS, all spirited as they unload a moving truck. Scattered below on the stoop, A FEW BLACK TENANTS.
C: FEMALE TENANT
D: Cops was lookin’ for you the other day.
C: INES
D: Them and everybody else.
E: stepping down
S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET – LATER
N: Terry and Ines let a few cars rip by. Terry then hails a cab. As one slows down, he embraces Ines for the last time.
C: TERRY
D: Now who’s gonna protect you?
E: still holding
C: INES
D: You should go.
E: releasing
N: The clamor of police car sirens echo from somewhere far, off fighting some other crime. Terry gently kisses her forehead. She dips inside the car.
S: INT. TAXI CAB - CONTINUOUS
N: The CAB DRIVER’s already got the meter going. Through the back window, Ines sees the young child man she raised still standing in the street as the car moves to the light. Cabbie gets a good look at her from the rear view mirror.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Ok, Miss where to?
N: She turns around, contemplating.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
