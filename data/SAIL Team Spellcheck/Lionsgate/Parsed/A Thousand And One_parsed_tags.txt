N: CHYRON - NEW YORK CITY, 1994
0: 
N: The grace of a little sun pushes through a barred window. It
N: illuminates four brick walls aging in yellow paint, a toilet,
N: and broken locker with the little desk affixed.
0: 
N: A FEMALE INMATE is perched on one of two cots. She’s black,
N: evidently pregnant and so world-beaten that her thirty years
N: of age could pass for forty-five. She closes her eyes. From
N: the opposite cot, another BLACK FEMALE INMATE leans in. She
N: finishes a touch of lipstick delicately, the way one
N: glamorizes a little sister.
0: 
N: This is INES DE LA PAZ (22, Black). She’s slim, light brown,
N: and enterprising enough to maintain the arsenal of goods
N: crowding the locker top. There’s also a few posters and
N: fashionable ‘fits strung on a makeshift clothesline.
0: 
N: Ines doesn’t recognize how jilted the woman is as she rises,
N: turning to clear the adornments on her wall. But then she
N: turns back, feeling the burn of wanting eyes.
0: 
C:                     INES
D:           Go ahead, take it.
0: 
N: The older woman giggles as snatches the beauty supplies
N: scattered on the cot, dashing out before a change of mind.

S: INT. RIKER’S ISLAND, WOMENS’ WARD - LATER
0: 
N: Ines is back in her element, renewed in street clothes that
N: pop. These pieces are humble, but boyishly on trend. She
N: resigns herself to a bench while a MALE CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
N: finishes processing.
0: 
N: Sensing eyes on him, he glances up. Ines returns a devilish
N: smile, as if the goal’s to keep his gaze.
0: 
C:                     CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
E:               (not falling, finishing)

S: EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET, MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - LATER
0: 
N: Ines sprawls the winter coat in her clutches as TWO STREET
N: KIDS weigh the out-of-season bargain. A sea of socio-
N: economically diverse FOOT TRAFFIC surrounds them.

N:         STREET KID #2                         INES (CONT'D)
N: Let me see the label first -     What you gonna do this
N:                                  winter, lay on your t-shirt?
0:

S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, BEDFORD STUYVESANT - LATER
0: 
N: Ines is a force, rapturous and unfazed by the summertime
N: stick as she jaywalks across the street. A few aggravated
N: beeps. She sashays between cars like they don’t exist.
0: 
N: In the backdrop behind her, LOCAL BUSINESSES ONE OR TWO
N: GENERATIONS OLD. They’re not thriving but still standing.

0: 
S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD PARK, BEDFORD STUYVESANT - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: From outside the bordering gate, Ines approaches A GROUP OF

0: 
S: EXT. WOMENS’ SHELTER, TRINITY AVE - LATER
0: 
N: Idle chitchat with LOITERING RESIDENTS - a few old friends -
N: keeps Ines busy. However, she’s distracted by every car,
N: NEIGHBORHOOD ADOLESCENT, and ADULTS that travels by.
0: 
N: She plops down on a hydrant in defeat. Growing limp, she
N: pulls out a Newport cigarette. Her ears perk up when THREE
N: TINY BOYS start yapping near the corner.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. BODEGA WALL, THE CORNER OF TRINITY AVE - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: Ines creeps over, staring down at one child in particular.
N: He’s centered between two other boys, MICHAEL H. (7) and
N: SHAWN (8) eating Marinos and jumbo icees. She smiles, almost
N: too shy now to speak.

D:           who I am?
0: 
N: TERRY (6), the tiny brown child she’s been looking for,
N: barely looks up, nodding dismissively.
0: 
C:                     INES (CONT'D)
D:           Let me see your eyes.

C:                     INES
D:           Let’s keep this between us,

S: EXT. PARK - DAY
0: 
N: Terry’s getting on the monkey bars when he spots her. Ines on

D:           Hey!
0: 
N: From Terry’s direction, we hear a scuffle --

0: 
S: EXT. FOSTER HOME - LATER
0: 
N: Ines settles at a bus stop across the street observing the

S: EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY

D:           times it’s not even you, it’s the
D:           company you keep. Took me too long
