S: EXT. REMOTE VIRGINIA AIRPORT - DAY
N: A small prop plane taxis toward the runway. It’s a serene scene, with a beautiful mountainous backdrop, until... SEBASTIAN bursts from the airport, sprinting to the plane. Two overweight TSA OFFICERS chase after him, calling out:
C: TSA OFFICER
D: Sir, stop! You can’t be out here!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: All due respect, Officer Man Boobs! But I gotta stop that plane!
N: As they lumber after him, we hear Sebastian in Voice Over...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: At this point, you’re probably asking two questions: One, “don't the guys in charge of protecting our airports from terrorists have to pass some sort of physical?”
E: V.O.
N: The TSA Officers double over with cramps. One starts to dry heave as Sebastian races ahead, heading off the plane.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And more importantly, “did we really just drop a bunch of cash to watch some typical American run-to- the-airport rom-com?” Well you can relax ‘cause the answer is no.
E: V.O.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Stop the plane! Please! I need to tell you something!
N: The plane grinds to a halt. The door opens and lowers to the ground, but before we see who’s getting off, we hear...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So put your damn Instagram away, go light on the popcorn crunch and just sit back and enjoy the ride. ‘Cause while this is a love story, I promise it’s anything but typical.
E: V.O. CONT’D
N: Sinatra music swells, as we see the following traditional Italian menu course appear on a title card over black... “APERITIVO”
T: FADE IN:
N: We lift high out of this airport scene into “Google Earth” imagery, as Sebastian begins his tale...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Like most American stories, my family’s started a long time ago on another continent... specifically, the magical island of Sicilia.
E: V.O. CONT’D
N: We cross the Atlantic, then push in toward the map of Italy.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Lot of folks like to call Sicily the big ball in front of the boot of Italy, which makes sense ‘cause the world’s been trying to kick our ass since the dawn of time.
E: V.O. CONT’D
N: We show footage of the following real life catastrophes...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: For generations, our people have been threatened by wars, volcanoes, testicle-crushing Speedos...
E: V.O. CONT’D
N: ...ending with slo-mo close-ups of Italian men’s beachwear.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: But we’ve survived it all through with one unstoppable force: FAMILY.
E: V.O. CONT’D
N: We show actual video footage of Sebastian’s family eating...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: This is actual footage of my Sicilian ancestors. All those clothes? Hand- stitched by my great-grandmother. And that food on the table? Harvested from a garden planted by my great- grandfather.
E: V.O. CONT’D
N: An NFL-style telestrator circles Sebastian’s grandfather.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Note the signature Maniscalco look, with the curved spines and the resting bitch face -- like a bunch of pissed off candy canes.
E: V.O.
N: We see a long sequence of Maniscalco men, family-tree-style.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: For centuries, the hunchbacked men in my family have operated with one goal: Do everything you can to give your family a better life than you had. Now this doesn’t mean spoiling ‘em like the kids I see today slapping their parents in the neck so they can play more Fortnite...
E: V.O.
N: We see iPhone footage of U.S. kids throwing tantrums.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It means working your ass off to provide, while also giving them love, and tough life lessons so that they grow up to be good people who never embarrass themselves.
E: V.O.
N: We start to flip through photos, family-album-style, starting with these actual pictures of Sebastian’s family in the ‘80s.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: For my father, this meant leaving his beloved Sicily for Chicago so he and my mother could give me opportunities he never got... like learning how to dance like Michael Jackson... growing a mullet... and blowing three hundred bucks on professional glamour photos...
E: V.O.
N: As we sift through several pages of ACTUAL sexy shots...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: My mother was right -- screw all those modeling agencies that never called me back -- I’m beautiful. So while my modeling career failed to materialize, my father busted his literal hump to support us and to instill in me certain rules of how a man should live his life... Like, always look people in their eyes when you’re talking to them...
E: V.O. then
S: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - QUICK POP
N: YOUNG SEBASTIAN makes intense eye contact with the OWNER.
C: YOUNG SEBASTIAN
D: Good morning, Mr. Mascarella. My father would like another pack of your finest Jewel Cigars.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: If you’re awake, you should be working...
E: V.O.
S: INT. SEBASTIAN’S CHILDHOOD HOME - QUICK POP
N: YOUNG SEBASTIAN, eats cereal and watches cartoons when YOUNG SALVO (30s, slick, pony-tailed, with an accent that’s half- Sicilian, half-condescending) enters and shuts off the TV.
C: YOUNG SALVO
D: If you’re old enough to turn on a TV, you’re old enough to fill out a job application!
N: As Young Salvo marches off, Young Sebastian calls after:
C: YOUNG SEBASTIAN
D: But Dad, I’m only eight!
C: YOUNG SALVO
D: Hey, look who can count! Maybe you should be a bookie!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Always be resourceful...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. SEBASTIAN’S CHILDHOOD HOME - QUICK POP
N: Young Sebastian shows a picture of a super cute dog to Young Salvo, who shakes his head, not having it.
C: YOUNG SALVO
D: For the last time, we’re not getting a damn dog! You wanna pet an animal? Go three houses down; I think they got a ferret!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And save your money...
E: V.O.
S: INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - QUICK POP
N: Young Sebastian looks over a menu. Young Salvo leans over and uses his hands to block the top and bottom portions.
C: YOUNG SALVO
D: No apps, no dessert, and if you don’t finish your main, I’m taking it out of your lawn mowing money.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: ...wherever you can...
E: V.O.
S: INT. SEBASTIAN'S CHILDHOOD HOME -- CHRISTMAS MORNING
N: Young Sebastian opens a present and stares warily at a small rolling pallet with some 2x4’s nailed on top.
C: YOUNG SALVO
D: You wanna me to buy you a skate board? I build you one instead!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Except on your signature scent...
E: V.O.
S: INT. SEBASTIAN'S CHILDHOOD HOME -- QUICK POP
N: Young Salvo and Young Sebastian spray fancy colognes into the air, then close their eyes and POP THEIR BODIES DRAMATICALLY through the mist. Sebastian’s ADORING MOM claps for her men.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: As a boy, I looked up to this man like he was a God...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. SEBASTIAN'S CHILDHOOD HOME - WINTER - QUICK POP
N: Young Sebastian struggles to skate up to the house on his shit wooden skateboard. He finds Young Salvo aggressively shoveling snow from a snow bank back onto their driveway.
C: YOUNG SEBASTIAN
D: Dad, aren’t you supposed to shovel the snow off the driveway?!
C: YOUNG SALVO
D: I pay the man five hundred to clear our drive for the whole winter, but it’s barely snowed. So I’m gonna get my damn money’s worth!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And for forty years, I lived my life by his immigrant gospel.
E: V.O.
N: Convinced, Young Sebastian grabs a shovel to help and looks up at his father, adoringly.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And it was all working out perfect, until I grew up and fell for someone who was my complete opposite...
E: V.O.
S: INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - MODERN DAY - EVENING
N: SEBASTIAN settles in with his dream girl, ELLIE (30s, relaxed, radiant, blessed with the charm to constantly mess with people yet still have a 5.0 UBER passenger rating).
C: SEBASTIAN
D: A cool and confident girl whose parents were so supportive, they let her be an artist. Imagine that. And her name... was Ellie.
E: V.O. in love
C: ELLIE
D: Wait, you parked nine blocks away? That’s crazy. And clearly a lie. You sweat just getting the mail.
E: feels his forehead
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Soon as I read that the valet cost fifteen bucks, I put on the merino. It’s all wicking away.
E: fun, sexy
N: Ellie laughs and they kiss. She starts tossing olives in the air, catching them in her mouth, and spitting out the pits onto a plate. Sebastian stares at her with stars in his eyes.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I mean, look at this girl –- the good pedigree, the positivity, the blatant disregard for basic manners... she’s everything my father raised me not to be... and I couldn’t be more in love with her.
E: V.O.
C: ELLIE
D: Well while you were finding a space pretty much back in our driveway, I ordered up a bunch of random apps.
N: Ellie grabs some bread and reaches for the butter.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Whoa, whoa, whoa...
N: Sebastian pulls out a special flask from his blazer.
C: ELLIE
D: Annnd of course you brought your own olive oil. Does it really make that much of a difference?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Does it make a-- Ellie! This stuff is the real deal, pressed, by hand, on my great grandfather’s farm. If you close your eyes, you can taste the soil from the Sicilian fingers that plucked these olives from the trees.
E: dramatically acting out
N: He does this and encourages Ellie, who does the same.
C: ELLIE
D: Holy crap, I totally can! Which is why I asked our waiter for hand-churned Irish butter.
E: kinda grossed out
N: Sebastian isn’t sure, but Ellie forces him to try it.
C: ELLIE
D: Come on. I won’t tell your dad.
E: CONT’D
N: Sebastian reluctantly tries it, but it’s clearly amazing.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Wow.
C: ELLIE
D: Right?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: This is unbelievable. Screw the bread. I’m gonna take this thing down like a popsicle.
E: grabbing the butter
C: SEBASTIAN
D: She’s amazing. And since the day I met her, Ellie’s been opening my eyes to all kinds of amazing experiences. Like “Lazy Sundays”...
E: V.O.
S: INT. SEBASTIAN AND ELLIE'S TOWNHOUSE - QUICK POP
N: Ellie is snuggled up in bed, as we reveal Sebastian next to her, fully dressed and ready to start his day.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So we just... “go back to sleep”?
C: ELLIE
D: That’s right.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: But when do we get up?
C: ELLIE
D: Whenever we want.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Huh. This is incredible.
N: Sebastian lays back down in bed, trying to enjoy it. Then:
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’m gonna set my alarm for six just in case.
E: CONT’D
N: As Sebastian reaches for his clock, we see it’s only 5:43.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And beauty treatments...
E: V.O.
S: INT. SEBASTIAN AND ELLIE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Ellie watches TV, in a green mud mask. Sebastian exits the bathroom, wearing a similar mask, looking super angry.
C: ELLIE
D: Hey, looking good, babe! Wait, are you pissed off?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yeah. That it took me forty-two years to discover avocado masks. My pores have never felt tighter.
E: super into it
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And a melange of tight-shorted games she calls “racket sports”...
E: V.O.
S: INT. INDOOR TENNIS COURTS - DAY
N: A TENNIS PRO feeds balls to Ellie and Sebastian, who are dressed in all whites. Ellie hits first, grunting loudly like Maria Sharapova. Then Sebastian hits, grunting the same way.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And last but not least: smiling.
S: INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - BACK TO PRESENT
N: Sebastian looks at Ellie and awkwardly tries his best smile.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Man, this is what life’s all about, huh? I’ve got the delicious food, the incredible girlfriend, and--
N: A fun Australian, BRETT, stands up, dinging his glass. He’s surrounded by people ready to dance and holding signs.
C: BRETT
D: Hiya guys! My soon-to-be-fiancé Derick will be here any sec, so can everyone please take your places?!
E: O.S.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: --your art school pal forcing us to be a part of his flash mob proposal.
E: disgusted
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Life with Ellie was pretty much perfect. But I couldn’t ever stop feeling like my father was there, watching and judging me.
E: V.O.
N: Everyone cheers as Brett and his friends get set to perform.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Ellie, I’m sorry. I don’t think I can be a participate in this.
C: ELLIE
D: Come on, Sebastian! You promised.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I know. You’re right. I did. But look at your friends! Dancing around this nice restaurant like we’re in the cafeteria from Grease?! It’s embarrassing!
E: can’t help himself
N: Ellie watches Brett and his friends doing a choreographed dance for a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN, who has entered.
C: ELLIE
D: I think it’s sweet that they want to show their love like this.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Of course it’s sweet! But it’s way too early in a relationship to set the bar this high! I mean what are they even celebrating? Two years of great sex, a few vacations, and successfully syncing their Netflix queues? I mean, you gotta build up to a gesture this big. Like, you should only qualify for a grand gesture after you’ve survived fifty years of mortgage fights and raised four bratty kids who disappoint you, but you’re still somehow managing to mash your saggy old privates together like two heavyweight boxers!
C: ELLIE
D: And I no longer want this burrata.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: All this? It’s just a celebration of having too much time on your hands! Trust me, when I propose to you, it’s gonna be intimate, just us. No one else. The way it should be.
E: then, lower
N: Ellie breaks into a smile, directed at Sebastian.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What? What’s that look mean?
E: CONT’D
C: ELLIE
D: You just said “When I propose.” It used to be “If”. Now it’s when.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’m aggravated. Words are flying out of my mouth. Now can we please get out of here?
E: caught
C: BRETT
D: Uh Ellie, what’s happening? I kinda can’t do this without you two.
N: He points to some dancers, who hold signs that spell out: “M-A-R-R-Y M-E D-I-C-K”. Ellie turns back to Sebastian.
C: ELLIE
D: I love being alone with you too. But we promised we’d help my best friend, so you better ignore that angry Dad voice in your head and get your ass up and dance with me.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: El. You know I don’t like dancing.
C: ELLIE
D: Pfft. That’s such a lie.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You’re right. I love it.
N: As Sebastian breaks, Ellie lights up -- so pleased this guy will do anything for her. She pulls out two cardboard signs and hands one to Sebastian. They fall into the routine with an “E” and an “R”, turning the “D-I-C-K” into “D-E-R-I-C-K”. Brett’s fiancé lights up and says an emphatic yes! And as confetti blasts out, Ellie laughs and kisses Sebastian.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So, clearly I was conflicted. But while my father represented my past, this gorgeous girl was my future. And now I just needed to find the right time and place to make that transition official...
E: V.O.
N: As Sebastian and Ellie keep dancing, cracking each other up, the Sinatra music fades back up as we fade back out into the next part of the journey... “ANTIPASTI”
S: INT. SEBASTIAN AND ELLIE’S TOWNHOUSE - THE NEXT DAY
N: Sebastian drinks coffee at the living room window, mocking a hipster with a topknot who walks his dog out front.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: His name is Bruce and he’s a rescue? But really, he’s the one who rescued us.
N: The dog drops a deuce on the lawn. The owner looks around and goes to leave, but Sebastian bangs on the glass.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yo! Guy! Pick that up or I’m gonna follow you home and stuff it into your vape pen! Thank youuuu.
E: CONT’D
N: Ellie enters, covering the mouth of her phone, with a curious but excited look on her face.
C: ELLIE
D: Hey babe. Making more friends with the neighbors?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Just marking our territory. Wait, that’s the same face you made when you backed into that cop car. Should I be calling a lawyer?
E: off her look
C: ELLIE
D: I’m actually on the phone with my parents and they’re, uh, inviting us to their 4th of July weekend...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Hold up, did you just say “us”? I’m getting the nod? Ellie, I thought this trip was for family only...
C: ELLIE
D: I know! I’m so torn between thinking this great news or that I might be dragging you into an Italian version of “Get Out”. Yeah, hold on, I’m asking him now! What do you think, dude?
E: into the phone to Sebastian, excited
N: Sebastian stares at Ellie, super intensely. It’s hard to tell what he’s thinking, then a single tear rolls down his cheek.
C: ELLIE
D: Hup, he’s man-crying again. That means it’s a yes. Gah! Mom, this is so exciting! We can’t wait!
E: CONT’D
N: Sebastian watches Ellie exit, as the tears keep flowing.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So yeah, I’m a big crier. I love to marinate in my own tears. But this was a huge deal. Ellie’s summer place wasn’t just the perfect spot to propose to her -- it also meant her family was starting to accept me. Which meant a lot, ‘cause -- how do I put this eloquently -- these people got class up the ass.
E: V.O.
N: Sebastian crosses to a framed photo of a gorgeous, WASP-y family gathered on the steps of their fancy summer place. They’re all dressed impeccably in red, white, and blue.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I mean, look at these perfect people with their perfect postures and perfect teeth. I swear, if you get close enough to the picture? You can smell the fresh lobster on their breath.
E: V.O. Sebastian huffs it
N: We push into the scene of the photo, as Ellie’s delightful family comes to life, giggling and posing...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And they intimidated me. Which didn’t make total sense as their story was also an immigrant story...
E: V.O.
N: We drift out of the scene and up into “Google Earth” imagery, then race across the Atlantic ocean toward Plymouth, England.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: But for some reason it’s considered more respectable as it started four hundred years ago, on a little boat called The Mayflower. Yeah, that one.
E: V.O.
N: We show a portrait of a stern-looking Pilgrim standing with his family, with the famous boat in the background.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: This is an actual painting of Ellie’s tenth great grandfather...
E: V.O. MORE
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Francis Love Collins -- taking his family to America. My family only ever took one portrait together -- after my Dad got a free coupon from Sears. Ellie’s family’s been taking ‘em for half a millennium.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: An NFL-style telestrator shows the following on the portrait:
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And unlike my parents, who left for America with nothing, her people came with everything -- money, furniture, even other people. This hacked off Irish dude was their “indentured servant.” That’s right. Ellie’s ancestors were so WASP-y, even their slaves were white.
E: V.O.
N: At Ellie’s summer house, we push down a long hall of stern- looking portraits of men all named “Francis Love Collins”...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So while my father came to chase the American dream; the Collins were the American dream... and they’ve been living it all the way up to Ellie’s dad: Francis Love Collins The Twelfth.
E: V.O.
N: ...ending on Ellie’s Dad “Francis Love Collins XII” (aka ”FRANK” -- kind, well-educated, can dominate a board room but may have trouble pumping his own gas).
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Crazy, right? Only Italian guy I ever knew with Roman numerals after his name was Rocky Balboa.
E: V.O.
N: We quickly flip through posters of the many “Rocky” movies.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Anyway, her dad goes by “Frank” and he’s the Chairman and CEO of the luxurious Collins Hotel Group...
E: V.O.
N: A “Collins Hotel Group” portfolio book opens and flips through old school properties, ending on a gorgeous one.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: ...which was awkward, as I happened to run a cool new boutique hotel that was stealing a lot of his Chicago business...
E: V.O. MORE
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So yeah, his baby girl was dating the enemy...
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: We then spin across the street to find Sebastian, wearing a nice suit, opening the doors to a newer, trendier hotel.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: But Frank wasn’t even the scary parent. That honor belonged to Ellie’s mom, whose actual birth name was, “Tigger MacArthur”.
E: V.O.
N: We see TIGGER (60s, old money, Ivy-educated, like Plutonium -- she’s thrilling to be around but also might kill you) engaging in a CNN talking head yell fight with ANA NAVARRO.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And that kitty’s got claws. As an Ivy League grad turned senator for the State of Maryland, it took her a long time to wrap her mind around her beloved daughter dating some working-class hotel manager.
E: V.O.
C: TIGGER
D: Maybe start taking those chill pills as suppositories, Ms. Navarro! If I was as anti-immigrant as you say I am, would I really let my daughter date the son of one?!
E: ON TV
C: SEBASTIAN
D: But this invite meant I was finally breaking through. And a long weekend away was my chance to finish charming the pleated pants off these people, and then ask for their daughter’s hand in marriage.
E: V.O.
N: Ellie reenters and moves flirtatiously into Sebastian’s arms, dabbing the tears from his eyes with some Kleenex.
C: ELLIE
D: I can’t believe it, babe! You’re gonna love it so much out there. In fact, you may not want to leave.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Pfft. You know these kinda places aren’t really my scene.
C: ELLIE
D: I dunno. It’s right on the lake...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: In my house, water was for drinking or wetting down hair before a cut. I barely know how to swim.
C: ELLIE
D: The tennis courts are all grass...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’m still getting used to the hard.
C: ELLIE
D: My parents bend over backwards to show us kids a good time.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: With all my issues? I won’t be comfortable with any of it.
C: ELLIE
D: Which is what I love about you.
E: snuggling into him
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So I had the girl I wanted to marry, the perfect spot to propose to her, and now I just needed the ring. Which should’ve been easy to get...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. SALVO’S HOUSE - BACKYARD GARDEN - DAY
N: Annoyed, Sebastian peers into an overgrown vegetable garden.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What do you mean, you won’t give me the ring? Grandma left it for me to use when I’m ready to get married.
C: SALVO
D: No! She left it with me, so I can make sure you don’t just give it away to some random girl.
E: O.S.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Can you please come out of the damn garden so we can talk about this?!
N: Salvo emerges from the plants, like a sniper. He’s now older -- with his spine even more curved, and his pony-tailed hair balding in the front -- but arguably prouder than ever, as he rises, sweaty and shirtless, with a bandana tied around his head, and dirt caked into his face and chest hair.
C: SALVO
D: Keep your voice down, son. We’re under attack.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Jesus, Dad. I shouldn’t have to keep telling you this, but ‘Nam ended like fifty years ago.
C: SALVO
D: Pfft. I was a combat tracker for two tours and believe me, the Viet Cong ain’t got nothing on these varmint son-of-a-bitches.
N: Salvo carefully follows some tracks over to his cucumbers.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Well, can’t you at least track them down with a shirt on? Your neighbors are gonna call the cops when they see you dressed like “Rambo of the Radicchio”.
C: SALVO
D: This bastard is a threat to my garden! And this garden feeds our family! What are you gonna do in winter if we ain’t got no vedge?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I dunno! Drive to the Shop ‘n Save?
C: SALVO
D: Don’t no Maniscalco man pay for vegetables. Vegetables are free! Now watchu think made these bites? Is it a rat? Maybe a raccoon? Possum. Oh, I’m gonna murder this thing the family way: by soaking some baloney in the antifreeze!
E: looks at cucumber licks it, then, sinister
N: Salvo opens some baloney and pours antifreeze on it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: When I was a kid I thought every- thing my dad did was normal. Like protecting our garden at any cost. If some string beans went missing? I’d wake up the next morning to a yard full of poisoned squirrels, birds, chipmunks...
E: V.O. MORE
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Basically anything that ever helped Cinderella get dressed, dead in our backyard.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: As Salvo tosses baloney slices, Sebastian notices some neighbors starting to watch and tries to block their view.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And whatever crazy he had back then, exploded after my mom passed away. Their once pristine house was now littered with old suits, records, and bottles of wine -- giving me a nice picture of what Frank Sinatra would’ve looked like as a hoarder.
E: V.O.
N: Sebastian goes over to his dad, keeping his voice low.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Hey, before you commit possum genocide, can you just admit that Ellie ain’t some “random girl”? I love her, you love her, just give me the ring so I can propose!
C: SALVO
D: Of course I love her! She’s perfect. In fact, her only red flag is choosing to be with you.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Thanks for the confidence boost.
N: Salvo considers for a beat, then turns to this son.
C: SALVO
D: Sebastian, I will give you the ring.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yes! Thank you, Dad!
C: SALVO
D: But first I gotta meet her family.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What?! Why?!
C: SALVO
D: Non mangi il frutto, finché non sai che l'albero non è malato.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Totally! What’s that mean?
C: SALVO
D: You got no respect for your roots. “You don’t eat the fruit, ‘til you make sure the tree ain’t sick.” Per tradition, I need to meet her parents so I can stare into their eyes and look for the rot.
E: translating explaining
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh Dad, trust me, there’s no rot in Ellie’s family. They’re classy, plus they don’t live anywhere near here. Can’t I just get set you guys up on a Skype date so you can “taste-test” them over the phone?
C: SALVO
D: No way. Needs to be face-to-face.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Well here’s the thing: I was kinda hoping to propose next weekend. At her family’s house in Virginia.
C: SALVO
D: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. It’s the first summer since we had to say goodbye to your poor mother... Ti amo amore mio! And you’re gonna leave me alone for the goddamn Fourth of July?!
E: kissing, to sky back to Sebastian
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Well it’s just, her parents invited me out to their summer place and--
C: SALVO
D: Summer place, huh?! Most people got one home, these people have ‘em for different seasons?! Must be nice!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So they got more money than us, who doesn’t? And it’s just one weekend--
C: SALVO
D: Oohhh just one weekend he says! ONE WEEKEND! Fifty years ago, I come to America to give a better life FOR
C: YOU!
E: MORE
C: SALVO
D: Skip EVERY weekend in Sicily FOR YOU! I fight in US Army to give freedoms FOR YOU! What thanks I get?! YOU GO TO CELEBRATE THIS DAY OF FREEDOM WITH SOME OTHER FAMILY, LEAVING ME TO BURN THE SPARKLERS AND EAT THE HOT DOGS, ALL ALONE! YOU SHOULDA LET ME LEAVE HIM AT THAT ORPHANAGE SO HE COULD GROW UP TO BREAK SOME OTHER FATHER’S HEART!
E: CONT'D to sky, in Italian
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Okay, I’m pretty sure I just heard the word “orphanage” in there, so I guess I’ll go tell Ellie I can’t make it this time. Jesus.
C: SALVO
D: Ok. If that’s what you want to do.
N: Sebastian rolls his eyes. As Salvo happily goes back to his poisoning, Sebastian exits, passing the gathered neighbors.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Nice to see ya, Mrs. Aquavella. If I were you, I’d keep those ferrets inside for the next week or so.
S: INT. SEBASTIAN AND ELLIE'S TOWNHOUSE - LATER
N: Dressed from work, Sebastian talks to Ellie, who looks upset.
C: ELLIE
D: What do you mean you’re not coming?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I just can’t leave my father. He’s been so lonely since my mom passed and, you know, the Fourth of July was always their favorite holiday.
C: ELLIE
D: Because of his military background?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: More because it’s the one holiday you don’t have to buy gifts and watching fireworks is free.
N: Ellie nods like she’s disappointed but really she’s thinking.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’m sorry babe. We’ll find another--
E: CONT’D
C: ELLIE
D: Why don’t we just bring him?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What’s that now?
E: taken aback
C: ELLIE
D: If your dad’s into the Fourth, he’d love it at our place. There’s fireworks, a parade, we even host a mini American Revolution with paint- ball guns in case he wants to light up some rich kids. It’s perfect!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: My father? Getting a close-up look at my new life while I try to seal the deal with Ellie’s parents? What an incredible idea!
E: V.O.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yeah, I don’t think so. I should probably just stay here with him.
C: ELLIE
D: What? No way! Don’t you want our families to meet?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yeah! Of course I do!
E: high-pitched
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I really didn’t.
E: V.O.
C: ELLIE
D: Oh come on, Sebastian! What, are you, like, embarrassed of him?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Me? No! Noooo. No! What? No!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Okay, maybe I was a little scared to bring my father into a country club environment where he’d see me playing fancy sports, eating meals out, and sleeping in past five am.
E: V.O.
N: Sebastian stares at Ellie, knowing what he needs to do.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: But I also knew that the stubborn bastard wouldn’t give me the ring without a face-to-face meeting. So I realized if I could just get through one weekend with everyone together, I’d be on my way to marrying Ellie and never have to worry about this issue again...
E: V.O.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Alright. You win. I’ll go ask him.
N: Ellie squeals with delight and jumps into Sebastian’s arms.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: But don’t get excited. My dad’s big on tradition; I doubt he’ll say yes.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. SALVO’S SALON - THE NEXT DAY
N: Salvo cuts an older lady’s hair, holding court in a fun and loud ‘90s salon. Sebastian stands sheepishly before him.
C: SALVO
D: HELL YES! I would love to come!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Wait, seriously?
C: SALVO
D: What are we gonna do instead... Spend the whole weekend, just the two of us, alone in my house, burning the sparklers and eating the hot dogs?
E: ”so depressing”
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You used that same exact example to guilt trip me into not going!
C: SALVO
D: What can I say, I got a way with words. Ladies, get your ‘dos done by Thursday ‘cause I’m closing the salon for the first time since ‘94!
N: The salon crowd cheers for Salvo, who is in his absolute element here. As Salvo dances around and has animated chats with his clientele, Sebastian looks at his him, concerned.
C: SEBASTIAN (V.O.
D: Did I not mention my dad runs a salon? With the Army and the tough life lessons, most people assume he’s a cop or a bricklayer. But no, he’s a hair stylist. And don’t you dare call him a barber. This man don’t cut hair; he creates styles.
N: Salvo lifts a dryer and spins a FEMALE CLIENT to the mirror so she can see her feathery new hairdo.
C: FEMALE CLIENT
D: Oh, Salvo! It’s beautiful!
C: SALVO
D: I knew you had some cheek bones under there -- you just needed Michelangelo to dig them out!
N: Salvo then blasts her with double barrels of hairspray. As she fades into a fog of CFC’s, Sebastian steps over to Salvo.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Okay, Dad. If we’re actually gonna do this, I gotta ask you to please be on your best behavior.
C: SALVO
D: What do you mean, my best behavior?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Well, Ellie’s family is pretty uptight and conservative and--
C: SALVO
D: Hold on-- are you, the son, telling me, the father, how to behave?
N: The salon crowd boos Sebastian as Salvo turns back to him.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Just remember: the main goal is for you to meet the family so I can get the ring and propose to Ellie. It’s not for you to price check their antique coffee tables!
C: SALVO
D: Oh, come on! How fancy can a stupid coffee table be? Seriously, how much we talking?
E: then
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Dad.
C: SALVO
D: I’m kidding! Ingrato son-of-a--.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: All I’m asking is for you to dial it down a little with all the...
N: Sebastian does a spot-on impression of his flamboyant dad judging people around him. Oblivious, Salvo does the exact same motions as he complains about Sebastian to his clients.
C: SALVO
D: Ah, I see. He’s worried about his immigrant father making him look like some kind of Goomba.
N: Salvo slaps Sebastian on the neck, affectionately.
C: SALVO
D: You probably forget this ‘cause I’m your dad, but the rest of the world finds me pretty damn charming. Isn’t that right, ladies?!
E: CONT’D
N: The crowd cheers for Salvo as he turns back to Sebastian.
C: SALVO
D: Trust me, these stuck-up rich people have a word for people like me...
E: CONT’D
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Loud? Obnoxious? Over-cologned?
C: SALVO
D: It’s “refreshing!” I promise you Ellie’s parents are gonna love me! In fact, they might want me to marry their daughter!
N: The crowd laughs and cheers as Salvo does his classic Salvo dances toward Sebastian, forcing him out the door.
C: SALVO
D: Now get the hell out of here and go pack your bags! Ya hear that, honey? The Maniscalco men are going on vacation!
E: CONT’D to sky
N: On Sebastian’s somewhat hopeful smile, the Sinatra music kicks up as we dissolve into the next leg of our journey... “PRIMI”
S: EXT. REMOTE VIRGINIA AIRPORT - DAYS LATER
N: A small prop plane grinds to a halt. As Ellie, Sebastian, and Salvo disembark, we hear the following VO:
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Growing up, my father took me on exactly one “vacation” -- a three- day trip to Memphis where we spent two hours looking through the fence at Graceland... and the rest of the time filling up a U-Haul with used salon equipment he’d bought from a bankrupt hairdresser. So, going on a trip with him was kinda fun...
E: V.O.
N: Ellie takes a big huff of the country air, invigorated.
C: ELLIE
D: Oh my gosh, the air is so fresh!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: ...but mostly it was strange.
E: V.O.
N: Sebastian goes to breathe it in, but coughs on a big cloud of smoke. REVEAL: Salvo trailing, having just lit a Jewel Cigar.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Dad, you can’t smoke here.
C: SALVO
D: Pfft. You sound just like that uppity stewardess.
N: Salvo takes another big drag and Sebastian dodges the exhale.
C: ELLIE
D: Isn’t this so beautiful, Salvo?
C: SALVO
D: It’s a lotta trees.
E: shrugs
C: ELLIE
D: Trust me, you’re gonna have so much fun. There’s tennis and swimming and horseback riding.
C: SALVO
D: Sounds like a white collar prison.
N: Salvo looks for an ally in Sebastian, who smiles back.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: The guy was clearly uncomfortable, so I tried to put him at ease by speaking his language: cheap.
E: V.O.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So Dad, I got some good news. Through one of my hotel connects, I was able to secure us a luxury sedan for the price of a compact.
C: SALVO
D: Nice work. But makes me wonder what you could’ve got the compact for--
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And then! I used that price to get us the compact on the house.
C: SALVO SEBASTIAN
D: Heyyyyy! Heyyyyy!
E: CONT'D loving that loving him loving that
N: Proud, Sebastian then puts an arm around Ellie.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So how long’s the drive, babe?
E: CONT’D
C: ELLIE
D: About three hours.
C: LUCKY
D: Unless y’all want to ride with me?
E: O.S.
N: They turn to see LUCKY (30s, cocky, well-groomed, kinda like a purebred horse brought to life). He’s dressed in a flight suit and holds a helicopter helmet under his arms.
C: ELLIE
D: Oh my god, LUCKY!!!!
N: Ellie runs and jumps into Lucky’s arms, spread-eagling her legs around his torso. Salvo lean into Sebastian.
C: SALVO
D: Whoa. Is this an ex-boyfriend?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Worse. It’s her brother.
N: Salvo cringes as they watch Ellie and Lucky repeatedly kiss each other on the cheeks...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: While I’d made some progress with Ellie’s parents, I’d made none with her older brother. His name was Frances Love Collins the 13th, so everyone called him “Lucky”. And that’s exactly what this dude was.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. IVY LEAGUE COLLEGE - FLASHBACK
N: We pan from a library to an Eating Club where Lucky finishes sucking down his share of a three-story beer bong...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: After graduating from Princeton, back when you could safely bribe your way into college, Lucky was on deck to take over the Hotel Group. In the meantime, he was working as a “Client Liaison.” Which meant traveling around the world entertaining wealthy clients with all the rich kid hobbies he’d had time to master while I was busy mowing lawns to pay off unfinished chow mein. We’re talking skiing...
E: V.O.
S: INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - QUICK POPS
N: -- Lucky carves a perfect powder trail, as others follow.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Sailing...
E: V.O.
N: -- Lucky leans off the port side of a sailboat, balancing it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: All the country club sports...
E: V.O.
N: -- Lucky hits a pure four-iron, then turns to the group...
C: LUCKY
D: Shit, I better change my shoes...
N: As the ball lands behind him on the green, he pumps his arm.
C: LUCKY
D: ...‘cause I’m on the dance floor!
E: CONT’D
N: The rich dude foursome all Golf-Laughs hard together.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: But I’d say his over all best skill was... being a prick.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. REMOTE VIRGINIA AIRPORT - BACK TO PRESENT
N: Lucky finally puts Ellie down and turns to Sebastian.
C: LUCKY
D: So happy you’re here, sis! I see you’re still banging the bellboy. I’m just joking, Sea Bass. Como estai, amigo?
E: laughs, to Sebastian
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Hey, Luck. How ya doing, man?
N: Lucky shakes Sebastian’s hand and turns it into a bro hug.
C: LUCKY
D: Ah, so great. Just got back from shredding pow in Zermatt. It was a huge winter so they still had snow in freaking June, man. It’s like global warming, my ass, right? You must be Sebastian’s brother.
E: then, to Salvo
C: SALVO
D: I’m Salvo. His father.
C: LUCKY
D: What?! No way. Seriously?! Man, it’s so hard to tell the age of anyone over forty. Let me goose you boys some free samps...
E: to Ellie
N: Lucky pulls two fancy bottles of lotion from his bag.
C: LUCKY
D: I’m an angel investor in this new anti-aging cream for men and, as you can tell, I’m also a client.
E: CONT’D
N: Salvo and Sebastian share a look like: fuck this guy.
C: LUCKY
D: Shall we saddle up?
E: CONT’D
N: Lucky straps on his helmet and struts to a helicopter. Ellie excitedly follows. Salvo does too, but Sebastian is nervous.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Ellie, you sure you don’t want to take the car I reserved?
C: ELLIE
D: No way! The helicopter takes twenty minutes plus the views are magical.
N: Ellie kisses Sebastian and pulls him to the helicopter. Salvo takes one last drag, apprehensive, then genuflects.
C: SALVO
D: I might see you soon, my love!
E: to sky, in Italian
S: INT. LUCKY’S HELICOPTER - MINUTES LATER
N: Lucky talks into his headset, as Ellie rides shotgun.
C: LUCKY
D: Alright boys and girl, we have lift off. Next stop: Mom and Dad’s!
N: Ellie whoops as the chopper rises away from the airfield.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: My whole life, I’d heard that rich people have “grace.” And I thought it was a load of crap, until I started spending time with them.
E: V.O.
C: LUCKY
D: If you look out to the left, you’ll notice the Blue Ridge Mountains.
N: Lucky and Ellie lean out, so comfortable, as we pan around the cockpit to find Salvo, who is far less comfortable.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Truth is, they are graceful with certain things ‘cause they’ve had so much time to get used to them. Like, using chopsticks, or knowing what to do with those hot napkins they give you on airplanes... and of course staying calm while flying through the sky in a hot metal box.
E: V.O.
C: SALVO
D: Good god, son. Are you okay?
N: REVEAL: Sebastian, clearly in a panic, breathing heavily and sweating through his multiple layers of clothing.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yah. Just getting used to the altitude. And the open doors.
N: Sebastian starts to hyperventilate and tug at his clothes.
C: SALVO
D: Hey Ellie, I think we might have a problem back here!
N: Ellie turns around and sees Sebastian suffering.
C: ELLIE
D: Oh my god, babe! Are you okay? You look like you’re melting.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yeah. It’s just a little hot. And I’m having some trouble breathing.
N: Sebastian gasps, sweating more. Lucky turns around, sees him.
C: LUCKY
D: Dude! Don’t you dare vom in my bird!
C: ELLIE
D: Lucky, maybe we should turn back.
C: LUCKY
D: What?! It’s only nineteen more minutes! Can’t he tough it out?
C: ELLIE
D: Babe, do you think you can make it--
N: Sweat now pours off his body as he aggressively sheds layers.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I can’t breathe! I’m gonna die! I’M GONNA DIIIIIIII--
S: INT. A VERY PEACEFUL RENTAL CAR - LATER
N: Ellie drives as Sebastian rides. Salvo sits in the back.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Soooo, that was my first time in a helicopter.
C: ELLIE
D: No way. Really? You seemed so calm!
C: SALVO
D: It’s embarrassing. I knew I should have forced you to join the Army.
C: ELLIE
D: Look at the bright side: If my parents ask you to be in the big family photo, you just shed about forty pounds of water weight.
N: Salvo and Ellie share a laugh at that.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yuk it up, guys. But I feel much safer down here on the ground.
C: ELLIE
D: I know, babe. And the drive is just as nice. In fact, here we are! Gentlemen? Welcome to “White Oak”!
N: They round a bend, and take in an elegant country club vista, which has been tastefully decorated for the Fourth of July.
C: SEBASTIAN / SALVO
D: Wowwwwww!
C: ELLIE
D: Right? So this is the golf course, down there are the tennis courts.
C: SALVO
D: What the hell are those guys doing? Besides dressing like pieces of a stained glass window...
N: Salvo points to GUYS in pastel clothes who are converting their golf cart into a hot dog in front of a large estate.
C: ELLIE
D: They must be building their float for the parade on Saturday.
C: SALVO
D: A parade celebrating what -- having too much time on their hands?
C: ELLIE
D: Hey! That voice sounds familiar. And awwww, look! It’s Sgt. Feathers and his family! What up, dudes?!
E: poking Sebastian then, braking
N: Ellie stops next to a pond, where a family of peacocks waddle across the road. A nearby sign shows: “Peacock Crossing.”
C: SALVO
D: Virginia’s got peacocks?!
C: ELLIE
D: No. My grandfather’s friend brought them here as pets years ago, but they didn’t like their cages so he just decided to let them roam free. Now, they’ve pretty much become the official mascots of our club.
N: As Ellie drives on, Salvo watches the peacocks waddle away.
C: SALVO
D: How much a peacock cost anyway?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Don’t answer that, El.
C: ELLIE
D: Copy that. And this is our house!
N: Sebastian and Salvo lay their eyes on a small structure, then share an unimpressed look.
C: SALVO
D: Huh. No offense, but I expected something a little bigger.
C: ELLIE
D: Oh, sorry, no. That’s just my little brother’s converted barn. That is the main house.
N: Sebastian and Salvo turn to see a magnificent property.
C: SEBASTIAN / SALVO
D: Wowwwwww!
S: EXT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - MINUTES LATER
N: Ellie parks in front of a huge house, where Frank and Tigger (in golf clothes and tennis whites, respectively) wait for them with Lucky and DUKE, an energetic Irish Wolfhound. Frank and Tigger rush over and greet Ellie, enthusiastically.
C: FRANK TIGER
D: Ellie-bellie! Come to papa! My little cuddle monkey!
N: They wrap each other up, giving each other all kinds of hugs and kisses. Salvo leans into Sebastian, concerned.
C: SALVO
D: Family’s a little handsy, huh?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Lotta parents hug their kids, Dad. Unlike you, who first saw me in the delivery room and chose to shake my hand.
C: SALVO
D: You were covered in placenta! Plus, I didn’t want to burn you with my cigar.
N: Duke the dog charges over and starts jumping on them.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Looking back, this all had to be a little overwhelming for my father. Unlike him, I’d had time to realize that there’s a certain formula to wealthy families. Starting with the tough mom who’s always dressed for the sport she’s about to play...
E: V.O.
N: Tigger (in tennis whites) turns to Sebastian and Salvo.
C: TIGGER
D: Sebastian! Hi babe! Sorry I’m not dressed up, but I’ve got a doubles match after lunch.
N: Tigger turns to Salvo, as they size each other up with their respective, domineering Type-A energy. And like two magnets, they’re riding a fine line between attraction and repulsion.
C: TIGGER
D: And you must be the charming father who gets to spend way more time with my daughter than I do!
E: CONT’D
C: SALVO
D: Nice to finally meet you in person, Tigger. Just last week, I was checking out your highlights on TV.
C: TIGGER
D: Oh fun! The CNN or FOX ones?
C: SALVO
D: The blonde ones. Your hair... It’s like a block of marble I just want to sink my tools into. Have you ever thought about--
E: touches her head
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Okay, Dad. Please stop touching other people’s heads.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Next up is the self-deprecating father who’s usually still dressed from the sport he just finished.
E: V.O.
C: FRANK
D: Yes, we’ve heard you’re quite the stylist, Salvo! Anything you can do to help me?
N: Frank removes his golfer’s hat to reveal his bald head. He laughs hard at his own joke. Salvo doesn’t really think it’s that funny, but the others join in. Especially Lucky.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: ...then their oldest kid who still gets an allowance from the family, so he treats his father like most of us would treat a boss.
E: V.O.
C: LUCKY
D: Good one, sir! Alright, I’m gonna go hit the links. Hit me up on my private line if you need anything.
N: Lucky salutes Frank, then speeds off in a golf cart, nearly hitting Sebastian.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Also, a second, more independent child who both parents wish would spend more time with the family...
E: V.O.
N: Ellie leans into Tigger and Frank, holding them tight.
C: TIGGER
D: Awww, it feels so good to have our baby girl back in the nest!
C: FRANK
D: The artist formerly known as our little princess. Haha!
E: MORE
C: FRANK
D: This finally feels like a vacation.
E: CONT'D hugs her tight
N: As they all hug, Salvo leans into Sebastian.
C: SALVO
D: I never treated you like that. I didn’t want you to get a big head.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Mission accomplished.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And then there are some fun bonus options, like a giant dog the family refuses to discipline...
E: V.O.
N: Duke keeps jumping up on Sebastian and trying to jam his nose in his crotch. No one does anything to try and stop him.
C: FRANK
D: Don’t mind Duke. He likes attention ‘cause he’s a millennial!
N: Frank laughs at his bad joke. Ellie and Tigger join in. Salvo looks at Sebastian like -- what the fuck are we laughing at?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And a weird third kid that everyone treats like an overgrown toddler.
E: V.O.
N: Tigger sees Salvo staring at DOUG (20s, out-of-shape, thinks it’s cool to have a beard, but really he’s just too lazy to shave) as he meditates by his house in full yoga gear.
C: TIGGER
D: That’s our Doug. He’s meditating.
C: FRANK
D: Supposed to be great for his ADHD.
C: DOUG
D: I can fucking hear you.
E: without opening his eyes
C: FRANK
D: We’re so proud of him. You! We’re so proud of you, dude.
E: to Doug
N: Sebastian notices Salvo watching, incredulously.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yup. This was gonna be a lot for my old man to handle. So much like the old waterbed he slept in at home, I was gonna have to help ease him in.
E: V.O.
C: TIGGER
D: So is anybody hungry for lunch? We could go down to “The Shack.”
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What do you think, Dad? I could eat.
C: SALVO
D: Thanks, but I already had some food I brought on the flight. Packed enough for three, but these guys didn’t want any.
C: ELLIE
D: Yeah, for some reason I wasn’t in the mood for sardines and taleggio cheese. Possibly ‘cause it made the whole plane smell like a wet sock.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: He used to send me to school with meals like that. I was the only kid in first grade who had to refrigerate his lunchbox.
N: Everyone chuckles, as Sebastian gives Salvo a pointed look.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: But we’d love to go, right Dad? Might be nice for us all to get to know each other over a meal?
E: CONT’D
C: SALVO
D: Yeah, okay. That sounds nice.
E: getting the hint
C: DOUG
D: I’ll drive!
N: Doug jumps up and runs to another golf cart, as Salvo and Sebastian avert their eyes from his Spandexed moose knuckle.
S: INT. COUNTRY CLUB DINING ROOM - LATER
N: Sebastian sits between Salvo and Ellie across from Frank, Tigger, and Doug in this big, impressive clubhouse.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: This club is huge, Frank!
C: FRANK
D: Yes, I suppose it has been built up over the years, but to us? It’ll always be “The Shack”.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And Dad... what do you think?
N: Everyone turns to Salvo, who’s preoccupied by the menu.
C: SALVO
D: This menu. It ain’t got no prices.
C: ELLIE
D: Oh, don’t worry about it, Salvo. They just put it on our account.
N: Confused, Salvo looks to Sebastian, who nervously pivots:
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And wow, these tables are gorgeous!
C: TIGGER
D: Yes! If you look underneath, they’re actually wagon wheels salvaged from the original carts that brought all the materials up to build White Oak.
N: Sebastian nods, politely impressed, then Doug butts in:
C: DOUG
D: This whole place was built by slaves.
C: FRANK
D: Douglas.
C: DOUG
D: What? I can’t tell the truth now? They’ll never admit it, but we’re dining in a house of oppression.
E: to Sebastian
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Ohhhh-kay.
C: FRANK
D: Sure, a lot of the south has a... checkered past, but that was long before we bought our place here.
C: DOUG
D: I can’t even bring my girlfriend, because I’m so ashamed. She’s African.
E: explaining
C: TIGGER
D: “She” is a person emailing you from Africa, and to whom you are sending back money. We have yet to confirm whether she’s a girl or a friend.
C: DOUG
D: They just can’t stand that I’m in an interracial relationship.
E: proud
N: A plucky waitress, GLORIA, shows up.
C: FRANK
D: Oh thank god. Afternoon, Gloria!
C: GLORIA
D: Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Collins! What can I get for you guys today?
C: DOUG
D: Chocolate milk and chicken nuggets.
C: FRANK
D: “Please,” Dougie. And you know we always let guests order first. Know what you want, Sebastian?
E: then
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’ll just take a Cobb salad please.
C: ELLIE
D: Ho-ho! Cool order, Carrie Bradshaw! Don’t you want a starter? They have tuna carpaccio! My baby loves a nice raw fish.
E: poking his tummy
N: Sebastian can feel Salvo watching and gets self-conscious.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Thanks, but I’m just gonna stick to the middle of the menu.
C: ELLIE
D: Alright. What about you, Salvo?
C: SALVO
D: Uh, yeah, hi there Gloria. This BLT that comes with onion rings... how much we talking for that dish?
N: Everyone else is a little embarrassed, as it gets quiet.
C: SALVO
D: What? What’d I say?
E: CONT’D
N: Gloria looks for help from Tigger and Frank, who steps in.
C: FRANK
D: Salvo, I know this sounds silly but the ethos of this place is “getting away from regular life”. That’s why we have no cell towers or Internet or newspapers, and we don’t like to put prices on things as that’s just an annoying reminder of money.
N: A long beat as Salvo tries to process this impossibility.
C: SALVO
D: So... all this food is free?
C: FRANK
D: Well, no, it’s not free.
C: SALVO
D: Then what, they just make up a price?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Dad stop, it’s not--
C: SALVO
D: Son, I’m talking to Frank here.
C: FRANK
D: No, they do have a set price. But at the end of the week, they just tally it all up and send me a bill.
C: SALVO
D: I get it. Gloria, if you don’t mind, I would love to have... a chat with whoever knows the prices?
N: Sebastian throws his hands up, frustrated.
C: TIGGER
D: Salvo, please, it would be our pleasure to treat you.
C: SALVO
D: No way. You’re already doing too much by putting us up in your home.
N: Sebastian leans into Salvo, trying to be discreet.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Dad, stop. It’s not a big deal.
C: SALVO
D: I know it’s not! You’re the one making a big deal out of it!
N: Other diners start to notice the rising commotion. Salvo is un-fazed and smiles nicely to the waitress.
C: SALVO
D: So Gloria, be a doll and find out how much it is for a BLT and a-- What’d you get again?
E: CONT’D to Sebastian
C: SEBASTIAN
D: A cobb salad.
E: small
C: SALVO
D: A cobb salad!
N: Everyone jumps in, trying dissuade Salvo:
C: ELLIE TIGER
D: Just let my parents pay. Just let us pay.
C: FRANK SEBASTIAN
D: Salvo, please let me pay! Just let him pay!
C: DOUG
D: If you guys want to pay for something, what about reparations?!
N: As they all overlap on each other, we SMASH CUT TO...
S: INT. SEBASTIAN AND SALVO’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
N: Salvo arranges his array of colognes, as a grumpy Sebastian finishes putting his clothes into the bureau.
C: SALVO
D: I don’t get what you’re so upset about. A real man pays his own way.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You’re supposed to be getting to know Ellie’s family and instead you made a big scene! Didn’t you notice that everyone was watching us?
C: SALVO
D: Who cares? These people are strange.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Maybe to you.
C: SALVO
D: Pfft, to me, and everyone else in the world! They like to “take a break from thinking about money”? Are you kidding me? Where I come from, that’s called dying.
N: Sebastian breaks a little, chuckling. He knows this is weird.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’ll admit it’s a different life.
C: SALVO
D: Hell yeah it is! Everyone dresses like we’re on a cruise. The men got hands so soft, I thought my callouses were gonna draw blood. And you notice how they downplay how fancy everything is? Like I can’t see with my own eyes.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh I’ve definitely noticed that. The house is sixty thousand square feet and has thirteen bedrooms, but we like it ‘cause it’s cosy.
E: doing an impression
N: Salvo laughs, as Sebastian further softens.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Then they do the opposite with the furniture -- making it all seem way more important than it is.
E: CONT’D
C: SALVO
D: I know! It’s like you can’t just have a regular chair to sit in. It’s got to have a backstory.
N: Sebastian goes over to an old chair and fake-presents it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: The wooden frame is built from pieces of an old Spanish galleon, and the canvases are harvested from androgynous whale butts.
N: They share a laugh, Sebastian goes back to normal.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: The only story behind the furniture in our house was, “You saw a La-Z- Boy out on the street, then pulled me out of school to go get it and now I don’t know geometry.”
E: CONT’D
C: SALVO
D: Hey. In my experience, how to spot a good deal is way more useful than knowing how to draw a triangle. Night cologne?
E: then
N: Sebastian nods and they spray their respective colognes, then step dramatically through the clouds. As they climb into bed:
C: SEBASTIAN
D: But Dad, I just want to remind you that we’re here because I want to marry Ellie. So try to give her family a chance tomorrow, okay?
C: SALVO
D: I know. Don’t worry, I will.
N: Sebastian switches off the light. A beat, then:
C: SEBASTIAN
D: These lamps are actually made from glass in the lighthouse where Ernest Hemingway first masturbated.
N: As they both crack up some more, we...
S: INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - LIBRARY - SAME TIME
N: Tigger, Ellie, Lucky, and Frank sip cocoa in pajamas by a fire, while Doug plays a shooter game on his Nintendo D.S., wearing bulky headphones with a built-in microphone.
C: DOUG
D: Sergeant Doug to Private O’Connor. You ready to kick some ass and take some dames?!
N: Dough laughs as Tigger pulls a blanket up over her and Ellie.
C: TIGGER
D: Mmm, we finally get you all to ourselves. So tell us -- what’s new in Chicago? How’s the art?
C: ELLIE
D: It’s great. All the pieces from my last show sold out in eight days.
C: FRANK
D: Attagirl! Your mom showed me the website. Just wonderful. We loved your subtle use of all those... uh--
C: ELLIE
D: Vaginas?
C: FRANK
D: That’s it! Such good fun.
C: ELLIE
D: Thanks, Dad. There’s a big interior designer who’s become a huge fan and she keeps buying up my work.
C: TIGGER
D: That’s so awesome, Ell! So now that you’re getting the contacts... you could pretty much start working from anywhere, right?
E: then, leading
C: ELLIE
D: Mom.
C: TIGGER
D: What?! We miss having you in DC.
C: FRANK
D: It’s true. These cheeks aren’t as fun to kiss on FaceTime.
N: Frank kisses Ellie and hugs her tight. Doug yells.
C: DOUG
D: Ah what the shit, dude? Don’t bail on me now! You know I can’t take this base without my wingman!
C: ELLIE
D: I totally miss you guys, too!
C: LUCKY
D: Her voice went up; that’s a lie. Dad, remember this moment whenever you sit down to revise the will.
C: ELLIE
D: Stop, Lucky. You know I’d love to live closer to home, but Sebastian has his dad and a great job--
C: FRANK
D: Yeah, working for those damn Hiltons!
C: LUCKY
D: Such a good gig. Do you still have to have herpes to work there?
C: ELLIE
D: The point is, he loves it and I couldn’t just ask him to leave.
C: TIGGER
D: We know. It’s just sometimes we worry you’re giving up too much of your old life to be there.
C: ELLIE
D: We have a lot of fun, Mom.
C: TIGGER
D: Sure, but... that house you guys live in, it’s so cramped.
C: ELLIE
D: We prefer modest.
C: FRANK
D: You like never go on vacations.
C: ELLIE
D: Because we’re working!
C: LUCKY
D: And all that cologne? They made my chopper smells like a Nordstroms.
C: ELLIE
D: You get used to it over time.
C: LUCKY
D: Right. Like if you were dating a fishmonger or a garbageman.
C: DOUG
D: Dude, just tell her you’re the man of the house! I doubt Martha Washington ever made George get off the Delaware to go take out the damn trash.
E: into mic
C: FRANK
D: And you’re such a cheery person, Ell. Both of them seem so... angry.
C: ELLIE
D: No, they all just suffer from ‘resting bitch face’. You should see their family tree -- it looks like the back of the line at a Sicilian DMV.
C: LUCKY
D: Haha, they do kinda remind me of the snow monkeys we saw bathing in those Japanese hot springs...
N: Lucky points to a gorgeous photograph of those mean looking monkeys soaking with just their angry faces poking out of the steamy water (look it up). Lucky gets up and does an impression of an angry-looking Sebastian and Salvo, rising behind the couch slowly so that just his head is showing.
C: LUCKY
D: How much is a Cobb Salad?
E: CONT’D as a grumpy Maniscalco
N: Everyone laughs. Frank gets up and joins him in doing the impression, also rising from behind the couch.
C: FRANK
D: What do you mean I can’t smoke a cigar near that baby!
C: LUCKY
D: Can I borrow an extension cord for my hair dryer?
N: Everyone is laughing now. Ellie stifles herself.
C: ELLIE
D: Guys, stop! I’ll admit Salvo can be... a little intense, but just spend more time with Sebastian. You’ll see he’s totally opened his mind up to my interests too.
N: Tigger and Frank smile, willing, as Doug wraps up his game.
C: DOUG
D: Yeah, I can hear her yelling. Sorry if I got you in trouble, bro. Good luck on that social studies test!
S: EXT. THE WHITE OAK GROUNDS - THE NEXT MORNING
N: Sebastian (in an athletic track suit) and Salvo (in an all black outfit with matching scissor purse), walk. They repeatedly pass happy people -- jogging, walking, and on beach cruisers -- who say good morning.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Look at us, huh? The Maniscalco men walking through a gated community -- as guests, not groundskeepers.
C: SALVO
D: Feels odd.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I know what you mean. Whenever I’m in places like this, I constantly feel like someone’s gonna come up and ask me to bartend.
N: They chuckle as a PASSING JOGGER approaches.
C: PASSING JOGGER
D: Beautiful day, isn’t it?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Sure is!
C: SALVO
D: Everyone here is so happy. What the hell’s wrong with ‘em?
E: beat
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I dunno, maybe their fathers let them sleep in past five forty-five.
C: SALVO
D: I couldn’t stop thinking about how much work I’m missing. Could’ve done four dyes and a perm by now. That’s two electric bills.
E: checks watch
N: A FRIENDLY WOMAN bikes toward them, wearing a bathrobe.
C: SALVO
D: Look at this one, riding around in a damn bathrobe.
E: CONT’D
C: FRIENDLY WOMAN SEBASTIAN
D: Morning! Morning!
C: SALVO
D: What, no job?
E: calling after her
C: SEBASTIAN
D: She’s probably got her money working for her in stocks. And not a bunch of old mayonnaise jars she buried in the backyard.
C: SALVO
D: You know I don’t trust no banks.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’m just saying, these people may be odd but they’re smart. And they got connections. You know if I marry Ellie, there’s a good chance your grandson goes to Princeton.
C: SALVO
D: A Maniscalco at an Ivy League?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It’s possible! And why you came to this country, no? So just try to relax and enjoy your time here.
C: SALVO
D: I am relaxed. See? I got sandals on.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Well the rest of you looks like Paul Mitchell on his way to a funeral.
N: They approach the courts, where people play. Salvo scowls.
C: SALVO
D: I can’t believe you’re gonna play tennis. What a stupid game.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I only said I’d play so you’d have time to talk to Frank. Have you ever even tried playing?
E: then
C: SALVO
D: Why would I? It’s just a dumb game for stuck up people who, instead of working for a living, want to dress up in tighty whities and moan like they’re having sex.
N: They hear two women playing and grunting like that.
C: SALVO
D: You see that? If this was a porno movie, the director would be like “can you two take it down a notch?” It’s embarrassing.
E: CONT’D shakes head
N: As they climb the steps to the tennis courts, Sebastian self- consciously zips up his jacket to cover his white clothes.
S: EXT. TENNIS COURTS - LATER
N: In the stands, Salvo watches with Frank and Doug, dressed in overalls as he draws in a notebook. On the court, Ellie and Lucky play doubles against Sebastian and an intense Tigger.
C: TIGGER
D: So, Ellie tells me you’re becoming quite the player.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Eh, I’ve taken a couple lessons.
C: TIGGER
D: Well get ready to bring it. I love my family everywhere, except on the tennis court. Chest bump!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh, I don’t know if--
C: TIGGER
D: CHEST BUMP!
N: Tigger chest bumps Sebastian, weirding him -- and Salvo -- out, then takes her position at net. Lucky prepares to serve.
C: LUCKY
D: I hope you’re wearing oven mitts, big boy. Cuz here comes the heat!
N: Sebastian readies to return, but feels Salvo watching him and plays it cool, not wanting to show that he can play. Lucky serves. Sebastian swings lamely and hits a lousy shot.
C: LUCKY
D: Aw yeah! Call me “The Concierge”, bro -- cuz you just got served!
E: CONT’D
N: Ellie looks at Sebastian curiously, as Tigger comes over...
C: TIGGER
D: What the hell was that, Sebastian?! Ellie told me you had game!
N: Sebastian looks at Salvo for a body language chat. Sebastian: “Talk to Frank!” Salvo: “What am I supposed to say?” Sebastian: “Just figure it out!” Salvo: “Vaffanculo!”
C: SALVO
D: So Frank, how long have you been-- Excuse me, Doug, but what is that?
E: distracted by Doug
C: DOUG
D: It’s an adult coloring book.
C: SALVO
D: “Adult coloring book”? Those words don’t make no sense together.
C: FRANK
D: It’s a little relaxation technique prescribed by our doctor to help him combat his stress and anxiety.
C: SALVO
D: Hey I know that feeling! Stress and anxiety is why I spend so much time in the office of Dr. Budweiser.
N: They share a laugh, then Salvo looks back at Doug.
C: SALVO
D: What’s got your goat, kid?
E: CONT’D
C: FRANK
D: For him, it’s all job-related.
C: SALVO
D: Hey me too! What do you do, Doug?
C: DOUG
D: Me? Oh... nothing.
C: SALVO
D: Hey! You should always feel proud of any job, so long as you’re getting out there and working.
N: Doug starts coloring more intensely.
C: FRANK
D: Um, Doug actually means “nothing.” I’m hoping he’ll come work for the Hotels, but right now he’s pursuing a career in video games.
C: DOUG
D: I’m nationally ranked in Overwatch.
C: FRANK
D: And we’re all so proud.
C: SALVO
D: But I thought you said he was doing this adult coloring to fix the stress and anxiety of a job?
C: FRANK
D: I meant of trying to find a job. Which is fine! He’s only 26; plenty of time to figure it out.
N: Frank rubs Doug’s back, but Doug shakes it off petulantly. Frank chuckles very awkwardly for a beat, then:
C: FRANK
D: You know what, why don’t you give papa one of those pages.
E: CONT’D
N: Douglas rips out a page for Frank, who grabs some markers. Disgusted, Salvo looks back out at Sebastian who is changing over courts with the others. Lucky hands Sebastian the balls.
C: LUCKY
D: Three-love. We’re smoking your asses like a Bolognese sausage. Haha, yeah! Crushed him with a classic stereotype burn.
E: fist pump
N: Ellie takes Sebastian aside, concerned about his play.
C: ELLIE
D: Babe, what’s going on with you?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What do you mean?
C: ELLIE
D: You love tennis and it’s like you’re not even trying!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Who cares? It’s just a game.
C: ELLIE
D: What?! At least take off that track suit. You must be sweating your tits off in there.
N: Ellie tries to unzip his jacket but he aggressively stops her. She notices Sebastian staring up at his father.
C: ELLIE
D: Wait a sec. Are you embarrassed to play because your dad’s watching?
E: CONT’D
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What? No! Okay, he’s not the biggest fan of sports like this and I really don’t feel like explaining to him that I’ve been paying a guy to teach me.
E: then, lower
C: ELLIE
D: Well do what you want, but you should know that my mom isn’t the biggest fan of losing. Yeah.
N: She points to Tigger, who is angrily using her racket to jam an empty water cup deep into a trashcan.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: At least she stopped chest bumping me. The only breasts I ever wanted to feel in your family are yours.
N: Ellie smiles thinly and joins Lucky on his side, as Tigger comes over to Sebastian, showing him a photo on her phone.
C: TIGGER
D: Did Ellie ever tell you about the guy she dated during her semester abroad in Scotland?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Is that Andy frickin’ Murray?!
C: TIGGER
D: Never lost a match with him on my team. I wonder what he’s up to...
N: She jogs up to net, leaving Sebastian to think as he readies to serve to Lucky, who mocks him.
C: LUCKY
D: Tell you what, bud! I’ll play lefty so this is at least a competish!
N: Sebastian looks from his sweet girlfriend to her smug brother to an annoyed Tigger to a judgmental Salvo, clearly torn.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Up until then, my worst nightmare had been my father seeing me enjoy this life, but at that moment I realized I still had to prove I could be a good addition to Ellie’s family. So thanks to the topspin kick serve I’d learned from a Swedish pro named Johannes... this would be the point of no return.
E: V.O.
N: Defiant, Sebastian takes a deep breath then rips off his tear- away track suit to reveal he’s dressed in the same tiny white tennis clothes Salvo mocked. Salvo’s jaw drops, as Sebastian lines up to serve, picking out his wedgie like Nadal.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Buckle up, Luck. These are live.
N: Sebastian throws up the ball, bends his knees, and hurls his body up into a serve, GRUNTING. It surprises Lucky, who slaps at the ball, sending it sailing over a charging Sebastian, who doesn’t even look back as he knows it’s out.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Fifteen love.
E: CONT’D
C: TIGGER
D: WHOO! There’s my big man!
N: As Sebastian fully throws himself into a powerful chest bump with Tigger, we begin a series of shots... --SEBASTIAN SERVES A ROCKET INTO ELLIE’S BODY, JAMMING HER. --SEBASTIAN AND LUCKY RALLY CROSSCOURT, GRUNTING LOUDLY LIKE A PAIR OF SHARAPOVAS. WE RACK FOCUS TO FIND SALVO WATCHING, BEYOND DISGUSTED. --AFTER AN INTENSE VOLLEY BATTLE AT NET, TIGGER PUTS THE BALL AWAY. SHE AND SEBASTIAN HIGH FIVE, THEN LET THEIR HANDS SWING ON TO SMACK EACH OTHER HARD IN THEIR RESPECTIVE ASSES. SALVO DOES NOT ENJOY SEEING HIS SON BOND WITH ANOTHER PARENT. --SALVO WATCHES HIS SON HITTING A SERIES OF GORGEOUS GROUND STROKES. EVEN DOUG HAS STOPPED TO WATCH THE GLORY. AT ONE POINT, SEBASTIAN CHASES A BALL DOWN AND HITS A “TWEENER”.
C: SALVO
D: Is this a game you can pickup fast?
C: FRANK
D: Not this fast.
N: --SEBASTIAN RIPS AN OVERHEAD THAT CRASHES INTO THE PLATES OF SOME NEARBY COUNTRY CLUB DINERS. HE POINTS TO LUCKY.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I will call you “The Concierge”, Luck -- cuz you just sit there while every one else has all the fun! Haha, yeah -- crushed him with a reality check burn!
E: fist pump
S: EXT. TENNIS COURTS - LATER
N: The players line up for a final point. Lucky goes to serve.
C: LUCKY
D: Ad-out, match point.
N: Lucky serves. Tigger slices the ball back and a brief rally ensues. Lucky hits a slight lob over Sebastian’s head.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I got it, I got it!
N: Sebastian backpedals, jumps, and CRUSHES AN OVERHEAD. Lucky tries to spin away, but the ball drills him in the space just below his ass. Lucky YELPS and goes down, IN PAIN.
C: ELLIE
D: Ohmigod, Lucky! Are you okay?
C: LUCKY
D: No, I’m not okay! Your boyfriend just broke the back of my sack!
C: TIGGER
D: Someone get him some ice!
N: Tigger scampers over the net and runs to Lucky. Everyone circles around him as Frank trots over with ice. Doug laughs.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’m so sorry, Luck!
C: TIGGER
D: It’s okay, Sebastian. I’m sure it was an accident.
N: Tigger takes Lucky into her arms, then surprises Sebastian by flashing him a wink and a thumbs up. She turns back to Lucky.
C: TIGGER
D: Easy, son. We’ll go cool my future grandbabies down in the lake.
E: CONT’D
S: EXT. MARINA - LATER
N: As Frank, Tigger, Ellie, and Doug walk down to the boat dock, Sebastian hangs back with a confused Salvo.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: My tennis victory should’ve been a proud moment for our family. But while most parents are happy when their kids win in sports, my father just wanted answers.
E: V.O.
C: SALVO
D: You looked like a moron. Why do the damn shorts have to be so tight?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh, come on. They’re not that bad.
C: SALVO
D: “Not that bad”?! I’ve seen veal wrapped in twine that looks more relaxed than your legs. Seriously. I shouldn’t be able to tell that you’re circumcised.
E: pointing to his crotch
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Whenever you’re done with the insults, I’d love to know how it went up there with Frank.
C: SALVO
D: I don’t know, son. I tried to talk to him, but he was too busy doing art projects with the world’s chubbiest train conductor.
N: Salvo gestures to Doug (still in overalls), who is busy decapitating dandelions with a series of karate kicks.
C: SALVO
D: When in the hell did you learn to play tennis like that anyway?
E: CONT’D
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’ve taken a few lessons. To play with Ellie. It’s not a big deal.
C: SALVO
D: Right. And how much those cost you?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: To the immigrant kids watching, you know when you get that question? You always give the “parent price.”
E: V.O.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Uh, about forty bucks an hour.
C: SALVO
D: Forty bucks?! You’re telling me you fork over the price of a long hair blow-out so some asshole can teach you how to play a kid’s game?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Now imagine how he’d react if I told him the actual price was eighty.
E: V.O.
C: SALVO
D: Lemme ask you something... You sure you want to be a part of this family?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It’s just a hobby, Dad! Lotta people have them. So stop acting like I’m joining some kind of cult!
N: Salvo scoffs, not convinced, as they arrive at a large boat dock where Tigger and Frank pass out champagne flutes.
C: FRANK
D: Welcome everybody to the S.S. Collins! It’s so nice having you all with us in “White Oak.”
N: They all toast and take sips. Tigger and Frank are beaming.
C: TIGGER
D: Now Frank and I have been talking, and we were gonna wait until the end of the weekend to do this, but now we’re just too excited!
C: FRANK
D: Sebastian? As a lifelong hotelier and father of the greatest girl in the world, I have to say it kills me that you’re working for my biggest competitor. So...
N: Frank looks over at Tigger, who nods eagerly.
C: TIGGER
D: Yes! Go! We could use a forehand like his closer to us.
C: FRANK
D: On behalf of the Collins Hotel Group, I’d love for you to join our side and become the new face of the luxurious five-star experience that is... “The Barrymore Hotel”?
N: Frank holds up “The Collins Hotel Group” portfolio, which features a gorgeous Barrymore Hotel with a DC backdrop. Sebastian’s mouth drops, as does Ellie and Salvo’s.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Frank, are you serious? That’s your signature property. And the most prestigious hotel in DC!
C: FRANK
D: It is! IT IS!
E: laughing hard
C: ELLIE
D: Wow, guys. That’s a huge offer.
N: Tigger, smiling big, notices that Salvo isn’t so pleased.
C: TIGGER
D: Yes. And we know this would be a big move for everyone, so please take your time, talk it over--
C: FRANK
D: And tell us what day to send the moving trucks!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Wow. Thank you! I’m so flattered.
C: ELLIE
D: Yeah, thanks Mom and Dad.
C: FRANK
D: Well we’d love to have our baby closer to home. And you too, Ellie!
N: Frank laughs at his joke and puts an arm around Sebastian. Ellie and Salvo are clearly processing the development, and Lucky is irate to see his father hugging another son-type.
C: LUCKY
D: This is so cool! So. Cool. Hey, as a possible future member of our family company, should we celebrate with a little jet-booting?
E: to Sebastian
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Sounds great! Count me in. What the hell is jet-booting?
E: then
S: EXT. LAKE - LATER
N: Out on the water, Lucky tries to teach Sebastian how to jet- boot (look up the clip of that guy wiping out at that San Diego pier). He hovers unsteadily trying to make it work.
C: LUCKY
D: There you go, buddy! You’re up!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Wow. This is unbelievable.
C: LUCKY
D: Right? Now lean very gently in the direction you want to go.
N: Lucky does that and moves. Sebastian copies him, loving it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Haha! I feel like I’m flying!
C: LUCKY
D: You are! Now come out a little deeper and we’ll practice turns.
N: They move out into the lake amidst some recreational boats.
S: INT. COLLINS BOAT - SAME TIME
N: Salvo watches them with incredulity as he struggles to stand on the rocking boat. Tigger approaches, way more nimble.
C: TIGGER
D: Salvo, would you like to borrow a bathing suit? You look... warm.
C: SALVO
D: I’m fine.
N: Salvo stubbornly takes a hand towel from his scissor-purse and wipes off the profuse sweat gathering on his face.
C: TIGGER
D: Hey, I just wanted to thank you for looking after Ellie in Chicago. We feel so lucky she’s met your son. You did a great job raising him.
C: SALVO
D: Yeah. He’s a good kid.
N: They look out where Lucky is teaching Sebastian how to dive.
C: LUCKY
D: Now just lean forward, then throw yourself headfirst into the water.
N: Lucky does this and pops back up, then Sebastian prepares to try. It’s not as easy for him and he looks kinda dumb.
C: SALVO
D: ...when he’s not making an ass of himself.
N: They share a chuckle.
C: TIGGER
D: And I know you guys are close so if they end up coming to DC, I promise we’ll take good care of him. We’ll help them find a house, they can join our clubs, use our tickets to all the sports teams -- plus, we’ll be retiring soon so if they ever kids, BOOM! Free babysitters.
C: SALVO
D: Ha! My retirement plan is to work until I drop dead, while still trying to style the hair of the EMT who’s fighting to revive me. But honestly I wouldn’t get your hopes up. I can’t imagine Sebastian ever leaving Chicago, or me. I’m the only family he’s got.
E: then
C: TIGGER
D: I used to say the same thing about Ellie. But then she fell in love and ended up living happily without me in a totally different city.
N: Tigger gestures to Ellie, who’s yelling support to Sebastian.
C: TIGGER
D: I know how hard it can be, so just know we’d be happy to fly you down anytime to visit. We’ll do whatever it takes to make Sebastian feel like he’s at home with our family.
E: CONT’D
N: Tigger pats Salvo on the back. As the reality of this lands with him, he turns to watch his son executing some dives.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Check it out, pops! I can dive!
N: Sebastian finds his balance then dives, and executes the move fairly well, and pops back up!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh my god, this is incredible!
E: CONT’D
C: ELLIE
D: Whoo! Nice one, babe!
N: Sebastian does another one, gaining confidence. Salvo watches, realizing -- maybe this is the place for him.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What do you think, Dad? Should I become the first Italian Aquabat?!
N: Sebastian does another dive and comes up, happy. Everyone on the boat -- including Salvo -- GASPS. Lucky starts laughing.
C: TIGGER / ELLIE.
D: Oh my god. / Oh shit.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Not bad, huh?
C: ELLIE
D: Sebastian! Your suit!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It’s Gucci. Why, you like it?
C: SALVO
D: No, you moron! It’s not... up!
N: Sebastian looks down and, we reveal that that force of the water has ripped Sebastian’s suit down to his ankles.
C: ELLIE
D: The water must’ve ripped it off!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh my god!
C: SALVO / ELLIE
D: Pull it back up! / Sebastian!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’m trying, but I can’t--
N: Sebastian tries to bend down to grab it, but every movement he makes causes the jet boots to propel him in a weird way. As he struggles, he can’t stop twisting and turning and crashing into the water, all the time fully showing his full (unseen to us) penis to the family and other boaters.
C: DOUG
D: Hey Sebastian! Your penis is showing!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yeah I realize that, Doug!
N: Sebastian keeps trying to pull up his suit, but only does more dives, splashes, and at one point hits the boat, his bare ass slowly smearing its way up a boat window. As Sebastian panics, Lucky laughs his ass off and films with his phone. Ellie yells at Lucky to help him. Everyone else yells to try and help. This goes on and on, until we...
S: INT. SEBASTIAN AND SALVO'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
N: Sebastian exits from the bathroom with his toothbrush, to find Salvo packing up his suitcase.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Dad? What the hell are you doing?
C: SALVO
D: Packing. It’s time for us to go back home to Chicago.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Are you crazy?! We’re not leaving. You haven’t given me the ring yet.
C: SALVO
D: Trust me. What I saw today? You don’t come back from that.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Stop bring so dramatic. I was far away. No one saw that much.
C: SALVO
D: That’s for damn sure! Look, I know I haven’t really seen you naked since the delivery room, but is it possible that your ding-a-ling hasn’t grown since then?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Come on, that lake water is cold! Now put the damn suitcase away.
C: SALVO
D: Nope. I’m gonna bring you home, set you up on a couple dates with some nice Italian girls, help you start over fresh. I’ve already got a new hairstyle picked out for you.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You kidding me right now? Dad, I’m in love with Ellie. That wouldn’t change if I accidentally showed my balls to the entire world.
C: SALVO
D: Oh, is that what you have planned for tomorrow? I’m sorry Sebastian, but you need to stop pretending that you fit in with these people.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Guy, I’m not pretending!
C: SALVO
D: Please! With the helicopter and the jetboots and those weird chest bumps you keep doing with Tigger -- it’s embarrassing!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Maybe, but I got news for you, Dad. I love the stuff I do with Ellie!
C: SALVO
D: You can’t be serious right now. You’re making an ass of yourself!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Only because you raised me to be afraid of ever trying anything new! And honestly, I was nervous to bring you here ‘cause I knew you’d just sit here judging me, with your black clothes and the scissor purse and your resting bitch face.
C: SALVO
D: I don’t have resting bitch face!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: We all have resting bitch face!
N: Salvo and Sebastian square off with dueling “bitch faces”.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Your problem is you’re so damn negative, you don’t let yourself enjoy anything, and so you think I can’t either. But my future is with Ellie, so I’m gonna keep trying to have open mind! ABOUT EVERYTHING!
E: CONT’D
C: SALVO
D: COME ON! EVEN THE JOB OFFER?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: MAYBE! IT’S A PRETTY GOOD ONE!
C: SALVO
D: UNBELIEVABLE! FIRST, YOUR MOTHER IS TAKEN FROM ME! NOW YOU WANNA LEAVE! WHY’S EVERYONE GOTTA ABANDON ME?!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’M NOT ABANDONING YOU, DAD! IT’S JUST, ELLIE IS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME AND WHEN I MARRY HER -- NOT IF -- HER FAMILY’S GONNA BE A BIG PART OF THE PACKAGE! SO YOU NEED TO START MAKING AN EFFORT HERE, YOU KNOW? BE THE CHARMING GUY PEOPLE SEE EVERY DAY IN YOUR SALON OR YOU’LL GIVE ME NO CHOICE BUT TO LEAVE YOU BEHIND!
C: SALVO VAFFANCULO, WITH THE ULTIMATUMS!
D: YOU’VE NO RESPECT FOR OUR FAMILY!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I GOT ENOUGH RESPECT TO KNOW WE’RE ALLOWED TO GO BED ANGRY... BUT NOT STINKY. SO QUIT YOUR BITCHIN’ FOR A SECOND AND GET OVER HERE FOR A SPRAY!
N: Sebastian grabs his night cologne. A beat, then Salvo begrudgingly grabs his. As they both spray, then dramatically jump through mist, full of unresolved tension, we...
S: EXT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Salvo walks outside, inhaling a Jewel Cigar in the cool night air, looking up at the stars. He blows out a long hit.
C: SALVO
D: ...and you should taste the food here. It’s just like the people -- cold, white, and dry. Amore, I wish you were here for so many reasons. Number one, to show these uppity snobs how to make a sauce. I mean, their bread tastes like a cardboard box. And I feel like I got paper cuts up and down my throat. But more to tell me if I’m being an asshole. Is this really the life we want for our son? I could really use a sign... Anything to let me know what you think about all this?
N: Salvo looks around the sky for any message from his late wife. Finally, a gentle wind starts blowing. The leaves in the trees start to rustle. There’s a scratching in a nearby bush. Salvo smiles, bracing for an answer, then... BRAAAAAAACCCCHHH! Sgt. Feathers and his family of peacocks bursts from the bushes, scaring the shit of Salvo, as they waddle past.
C: SALVO
D: Stupid peacocks! Bunch of goddamn showoffs if you ask me!
E: CONT’D
N: As Salvo flicks his burning cigar after them, still unsure what to do, the music kicks back up as we fade into the next part of the journey... “SECONDI”
S: INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING
N: Sebastian enters to find Frank and Lucky eating breakfast.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: After our fight, I woke up nervous. That was the first time I’d yelled at my father like that and I was scared to see how he’d respond.
E: V.O.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Hey, good morning, gents.
C: FRANK
D: Heyyy! There he is.
N: Lucky gets up and introduces himself.
C: LUCKY
D: Hey man, how ya doing? I’m Lucky.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What? Lucky, it’s me. Sebastian.
C: LUCKY
D: Oh, right. You look so different without your crotch on display.
C: FRANK
D: Ignore him. How’d you sleep, buddy?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Not bad. Have you seen my dad?
C: FRANK
D: I think he’s still out on a walk with Ellie, Doug, and Tigger.
N: Sebastian laughs, then stops when he sees Frank is serious.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Wait, for real?
C: FRANK
D: Yeah, they should be back any minute. Sit down and eat.
N: Sebastian looks outside the house and sees a whole new Salvo power-walking toward them with the others. He’s now dressed in vacation wear -- shorts, flip-flops, and a Polo shirt with the giant logo -- as he holds the leash strapped to Duke.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Holy mother of God...
N: Sebastian opens the door to meet them. Salvo is mid-story.
C: SALVO
D: ...so I says to him, I say, “Why would I buy you a skateboard, when I can build you one instead!”
N: They all laugh hard as they enter the house. Sebastian takes in the marvel that is Salvo in vacation-mode.
C: SALVO
D: Hey there, sleepy-head! I was just telling them about the time I gave you a skateboard for Christmas.
E: CONT’D
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Let me guess -- you skipped the part where the wheels locked up and I had to have skin from my ass grafted onto my face?
N: Salvo reaches over and rubs Sebastian’s cheek affectionately.
C: SALVO
D: That’s how it stays so smooth!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: When did you get up anyway?
C: SALVO
D: Early! But I didn’t want to wake you, so I snuck out, watched some news, did my laundry, fixed the bannister, reorganized the spice rack... and then the sun came up, so I started cooking breakfast. And then I went for a walk so I could get to know the family. Good people these Collins. Even the weird one.
N: Doug stops chewing a cinnamon roll to wonder if that’s about him. Still processing, Sebastian takes in his “new dad”.
C: SALVO
D: What’s the matter? I’m just trying to make an effort.
E: CONT’D
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And I appreciate that. It’s just... the shorts.
C: SALVO
D: What about ‘em?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You’re wearing them. I don’t think I’ve ever seen your legs before.
C: SALVO
D: Oh yeah, they’re a little pale.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And so many veins. I can’t tell if those are your legs or the map your platoon used to find Ho Chi Minh.
C: SALVO
D: All I know is, I feel great, it’s a sunny day, and Frank, I’d love to make you guys a proper Italian dinner tonight. As a thank you for letting us stay at your place.
C: FRANK
D: Oh, Salvo. That’s not necessary. We don’t keep a lot of food here and the market’s closed for the holiday.
C: SALVO
D: Don’t worry -- a Maniscalco always finds a way to feed his family.
C: FRANK
D: Well, alright then. That would be lovely. Thank you, Salvo!
C: SALVO
D: My pleasure! Now you kids go have fun, play your tennis, sail your boats, do whatever you need to do to work up an appetite for the best meal of your lives.
N: Salvo gives Sebastian a look “See, I’m trying.”
C: DOUG
D: Just know I don’t eat pork.
C: SALVO
D: Don’t worry, kid. I think we’ve all had our fill of sausage for the weekend.
E: re: Sebastian
N: Salvo gestures to Sebastian with his thumb, and everyone but Sebastian does a hard country club laugh together.
S: INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT
N: Sebastian, Salvo, and the Collins enjoy a delicious meal. They’re making pleasure noises like intense flav-or-gasms.
C: FRANK
D: Salvo, this is delicious. I can’t believe you put this all together with what we had in the house.
C: SALVO
D: I told you I could make it happen!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: My guess is he raided the kitchen at “The Shack”. You might wanna ask Gloria to check the inventory.
N: Salvo loudly shushes Sebastian. Everyone laughs.
C: TIGGER
D: What do you call this dish? It tastes like gourmet chicken parm.
C: SALVO
D: It’s called: “Carciofi y pavone.”
C: TIGGER / FRANK
D: Carciofi y pavone.
E: loving it
C: LUCKY
D: It’s genuinely good. If I wasn’t balls deep in this Keto diet, I’d totally be swallowing these bites.
N: Lucky finishes chewing, then spits his food into the trash.
C: SALVO
D: It’s the least I could do, given all you’re offering my son. La famiglia non è una cosa
E: raises his glass
C: importante. È tutto.
D: Family isn’t just one important thing; it’s everything.
E: then, translating
C: FRANK
D: Here, here!
N: As they clink and drink, even Sebastian has to admit it’s a nice moment. He then notices that the bottle is empty.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’ll grab some more vino.
C: FRANK
D: When in Rome! You know, because you guys are Italian.
N: He laughs and even Salvo joins in. As Sebastian heads out, he gives a “thank you” sign to Salvo, who winks back.
S: INT. GARAGE - MINUTES LATER
N: Sebastian pulls out a bottle of wine and as he turns, he gets pinned against the wall and kissed by an excited Ellie.
C: ELLIE
D: Let’s run away together!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What, now?
C: ELLIE
D: Yeah! Let’s move to Maine and open a bed-and-breakfast. You could run it, I’ll build a studio, and in between we could work on populating the world with happier Maniscalcos.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I definitely like the lots of sex part but where’s this is coming from? It’s going so well in there. Like, our families are actually getting along.
C: ELLIE
D: I know! And that makes me think something must be wrong.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Heyyyy. Look at you, acting all paranoid like a mini-Maniscalco. And normally I’d be with you on this, but I think you’re just weirded out ‘cause my dad’s acting all nice.
E: Ellie laughs
C: ELLIE
D: Oh my god, I think you’re right. This honestly might be the first time I’ve ever seen him smile.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It’s very off-putting! He looks like someone’s pulling his mouth back with two fish hooks.
N: Sebastian imitates what his dad looks like. Ellie laughs.
C: ELLIE
D: Yeah, he’s clearly never used those muscles before. Like the corners of his mouth just woke up from a coma.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So, yes, I do want to run away with you, but I also kinda want to enjoy this good mood while it lasts.
C: ELLIE
D: Okay, that’s fair. Our B&B was probably haunted anyway. But speaking of good things that don’t last very long...
E: then, flirty
N: Ellie puts her hands on Sebastian’s waist and raises her eyebrows suggestively. Sebastian laughs, into it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Here? This garage is pretty echo-y and you know I’m a screamer.
N: Ellie laughs. They start to make out, but as they step back, Ellie accidentally knocks the lids off some trashcans. Behind her, Sebastian squints as he sees what looks like two eyes staring back at him. He looks closer and sees it’s actually: FUCKING PEACOCK FEATHERS! ...sticking out from the top of the trash can. His eyes go wide and he starts to panic as he realizes...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Pavone.
E: CONT’D
C: ELLIE
D: What, is it on my breath?
N: Sebastian’s world starts to close in on him as he processes what his father has done, while simultaneously trying to keep Ellie from also making this discovery.
C: ELLIE
D: Babe? What’s wrong with you?
E: CONT’D
N: Ellie starts to turn, but Sebastian keeps her facing forward as he stages a hug to grab the trashcan lid and replace it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Nothing! I just... don’t want this wine to get more room temp. We better go back inside.
N: Sebastian grabs the wine and pulls her away.
C: ELLIE
D: Aw. Right when you got me all excited for garage sex.
S: INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - DINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
N: Sebastian returns with Ellie to see everyone getting along famously. The world moves in slow motion for Sebastian, as everyone takes HUGE BITES and feasts on Sgt. Feathers. They obliviously chew the peacock, toasting their glasses and repeating the name of the dish in Italian accents.
C: FRANK
D: Carciofi y pavone!
C: TIGGER
D: Carciofi y Pavone!
C: LUCKY / DOUG
D: Pavone! / Pavone!
N: As Salvo smiles broadly at a still spiraling Sebastian, we...
S: INT. THE WOODS - TWO A.M.
N: Sebastian pushes Salvo into the woods, carrying a bag of what we can presume is the peacock carcass, and two shovels. They repeatedly slap mosquitos and bugs that are biting them.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I can’t believe you fed them a peacock!!! How could you do this?!
C: SALVO
D: Easy. My recipe called for chicken, the store was closed, so like any great chef I improvised.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: By murdering their beloved mascot?!
C: SALVO
D: They still got three left! And I don’t see the big deal. You eat chicken, don’t you? And turkey and duck and other birds?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Of course!
C: SALVO
D: Well a peacock is just a chicken with a fancy coat on. What, we’re supposed to have more respect for a bird because it dresses like Elton John?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You’re a goddamn monster!
C: SALVO
D: No, I’m a survivor! Where we come from, you do whatever you need to keep the family fed! It’s called the peasant mentality.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: This ain’t where you came from and these ain’t peasants! So just shut up and help me dig!
N: Sebastian tosses a shovel to Salvo. They both start digging, as Sebastian slaps at the large mosquitos on his neck.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Man, these bugs are all over me.
E: CONT’D
C: SALVO
D: It’s our cologne. They can’t resist it. These country mosquitos got a lot in common with girls on the beaches of Palermo.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Pfft. And you said I was “ingrato” for worrying you might make us look like some bad Italian stereotype.
C: SALVO
D: Pfft yourself. I’m not doing that!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Are you blind? We’re literally out in the woods, in the middle of the night, trying to get rid of a fuckin’ body!
C: SALVO
D: Okay, I’ll admit this does have a bit of a Casino vibe. But I was just trying to help you win the family over with an amazing meal!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: If this is your idea of help, I think I’m good from now on!
C: SALVO
D: Hey, what happened to “making an effort here”? If you did it, you’d see this as a fun bonding moment. Kinda reminds me of when we used to dig snow together in our driveway.
E: warmly
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Dad, we aren’t bonding! We’re getting rid of evidence! If Ellie’s family finds out about this, they’re gonna kill us.
E: then, freaking
C: SALVO
D: Nah. Whether they like it or not, they’re a part of this now.
N: As an exasperated Sebastian goes back to digging, we...
S: INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY
N: Tired and covered in bug bites, Sebastian enters with Salvo. They find Frank standing at the island, eating from a plate.
C: FRANK
D: Morning, gentlemen! Hey, thanks again for dinner last night. Mmm. This is one of those dishes that’s even better as leftovers.
E: takes another bite
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Please put down the plate, Frank! We have to tell you something.
E: takes a deep breath
C: SALVO
D: No, we don’t.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yes, we do.
N: Frank puts down the plate, concerned.
C: FRANK
D: Whoa! Look at all those bug bites! Is the screen in your room broken?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Well it’s a funny story. Hopefully. See, last night, my father, he...
N: Ellie runs in, looking concerned.
C: ELLIE
D: Sebastian, there you are! My mom needs to talk to your dad!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Is this about the bird? I swear we were about to tell you guys.
C: ELLIE
D: What? No. MSNBC just called her to do an interview and she has no one to do her hair and make-up. Can you help her get ready?
E: to Salvo
C: SALVO
D: Ha! That’s like asking Van Gogh if he can draw a smiley face. But Sebastian, are you sure it’s okay if I try to help?
E: then
N: As everyone turns to Sebastian for an answer, we...
S: INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - LIBRARY - TWO HOURS LATER
N: Salvo finishes styling Tigger, then spins her around in a chair to face the mirror. Her hair has been straightened, trimmed, and slicked back into a tight boyish ponytail. She studies the cut and can’t quite make sense of it. Neither can Ellie, Sebastian, or Frank. Only Salvo looks proud.
C: SALVO
D: So what do you think, Tig?
C: TIGGER
D: Well, for starters, this isn’t at all what I asked you to do!
C: SALVO
D: Yeah, I don’t really do requests. The way I work is I look at your face and get a sense of your aura, then let that dictate the style your personality demands.
C: TIGGER
D: I’m about to go on TV! I just want to look like myself! Oh my god! Frank, do I look horrible?
E: fusses with her hair
C: FRANK
D: Well no, it’s not horrible. It’s... Ellie?
E: bailing
C: ELLIE
D: No! I’m still trying to figure out... exactly... what it is.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Dad, can’t you just ditch the aura crap and do what she wants?
C: SALVO
D: Son, that’s like asking Caravaggio to go back in and touch up “The Beheading of Holofernes.” When it’s done it’s done!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: That what of who?
C: TIGGER
D: Oh my god. Okay. It’s just one appearance. I guess it’ll be--
N: Lucky barges in, looking at his phone...
C: LUCKY
D: Anyone want to see a slo-mo vid of Sebastians’s floppy...
N: Lucky stops when he sees Tigger and starts laughing.
C: LUCKY
D: Holy shit, Mom! Why do you have the same exact haircut as Salvo?
E: CONT’D
N: Everyone turns to look at Tigger and Salvo in the mirror and realizes for the first time that Salvo has indeed given her an almost identical female version of his slicked ponytail. ELLIE / FRANK / SEBASTIAN I see it now. / Yup. / Jesus, Dad!
C: LUCKY
D: You look like those weird boy girl twins who dress up like each other.
C: TIGGER
D: Salvo! How could you do this to me?
C: SALVO
D: I mean, I didn’t realize I was doing it, but even now I gotta say... you look incredible!
C: TIGGER
D: What?! In ten minutes, I’m supposed to go on TV to discuss the crisis in Israel and you’ve made me look like a bitter old Italian man!
N: Salvo shrugs. Tigger closes her eyes, eerily calm.
C: TIGGER
D: Everybody please get out.
E: CONT’D
C: ELLIE
D: Mom, maybe we can--
C: TIGGER
D: OUT! DO YOU HEAR ME? GET! OUT!
N: Everybody starts to file out... except Salvo, who lingers.
C: TIGGER
D: What?! What do you want?!
E: CONT’D
C: SALVO
D: I don’t mean to be a stickler, but after I provide a style to someone it’s customary to offer me a--
C: TIGGER
D: I’M NOT GIVING YOU A STUPID TIP!
S: INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - KITCHEN - LATER
N: Sebastian and Salvo watch “ALL IN WITH CHRIS HAYES” on live TV as Tigger gives a very heated talking head interview.
C: TIGGER
D: All due respect, Chris, but the existing policy has been working for two decades! Why change now?!
E: ON TV
C: SALVO
D: Damn she’s really kicking some ass.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yeah, because she’s pretty much talking to you!
C: CHRIS HAYES
D: But sometimes change is necessary.
E: ON TV
C: TIGGER
D: You don’t just make MAJOR decisions based on INSTINCT! You gotta LISTEN to people you’re servicing, or someone’s gonna end up DEAD!
E: ON TV
C: SALVO
D: Yeah, okay, maybe a little.
N: Sebastian lowers the volume and turns to Salvo.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: As soon as this is over, you need to go apologize to her.
C: SALVO
D: “Apologize”?! For what?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: She asked you for a touch up and you made her look like Dom DeLuise!
C: SALVO
D: That style gives her a dignity that’s more age-appropriate. If anything she should be thanking me!
N: Ellie enters, hearing this.
C: ELLIE
D: I wouldn’t hold your breath.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Is she really that hacked off?
C: ELLIE
D: She keeps saying you guys will settle this on the paintball field, so I think maybe a little?
C: SALVO
D: Most women consider it an honor to get their hair cut by East Chicago’s three time stylist-of-the-year.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: That was back in the Eighties, Dad.
C: SALVO
D: Which was the golden age of hair!
N: Salvo throws up his hands in frustration and exits as Sebastian turns back to Ellie.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’m really sorry, babe.
C: ELLIE
D: Whatever, it’s just hair. It’s not like he killed a pet or something.
N: As Ellie reaches for a nibble from Frank’s plate, Sebastian grabs it and dumps it in the trash. We then overlap LOUD REVOLUTION-ERA “FIFE & DRUM” MUSIC...
S: EXT. THE WHITE OAKS GROUNDS - THAT AFTERNOON
N: ...as we come up on Frank marching in an authentic Continental Army Captain’s uniform. The music goes quiet and tinny as we reveal Doug ambling ahead of him, playing it from a small bluetooth speaker. Frank stops at a stockade of paintball weaponry, where our family members and other CLUB MEMBERS are drawing red or blue notecards from a vintage tricorn hat.
C: FRANK
D: Welcome everybody to the ninth annual “White Oak Paintball American Revolution”!
N: People whoop and holler in support.
C: FRANK
D: Now if you’ve drawn a red card, you will be representing the Bastardly British Forces. Booooo! And if you have blue, you’ll fight with me for the Continental Army, represented by this actual uniform worn by my forefather Captain Frank Collins the Sixth, whose blood has soaked into this very collar.
E: CONT’D chuckling
C: DOUG
D: He cut himself shaving!
C: FRANK
D: DAMMIT, DOUGLAS! THE MAN WAS STILL
C: INJURED ON THE BATTLEFIELD!
D: Okay, Lucky. Be a sport and take us through the rules.
E: gathering himself
N: Lucky steps forward, holding up his paintball gun.
C: LUCKY
D: Alright folks, it’s pretty simple. Everyone gets a gun and a mask, which should be worn at all times. Red will fight blue. One hit means you’re injured...
N: Lucky fires at Sebastian, who recoils from the pain.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Ow!
C: LUCKY
D: Two means you’re dead.
N: Lucky fires two more bullets into Sebastian’s butt cheeks.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Dude! Ugh! Come on already!
C: LUCKY
D: When we’re not fighting, always keep your safeties on by making sure this switch is set to black. Can you handle that, Sea Bass?
N: Sebastian sets his safety to black, then pulls the trigger to check it and fires a bullet straight into the underside of his chin, sending him flailing backwards. Salvo immediately pulls his gun on Lucky!
C: SALVO
D: Stop messing with my son, you son of a bitch!
C: TIGGER
D: Who you calling a bitch, bitch!
N: Tigger pulls a gun on Salvo, causing several others to pull guns on each other! It looks like a lowest possible stakes version of the end to a Quintin Tarrantino movie.
C: ELLIE
D: Whoa, whoa! Everybody calm down.
N: Everybody stands down with their weapons, as Lucky laughs.
C: LUCKY
D: Most important rule of all: never trust your enemies! The safety is on when the switch is set to red. Now, the team with the last man standing wins the war. Good luck!
N: Everyone gears up. Team Blue includes Frank, Tigger, and Lucky. Salvo, Sebastian, Doug and Ellie are on Team Red.
C: ELLIE
D: Alright boys, we ready for this?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’m feeling okay for a guy who’s already been shot four times. Everything good with you, Dad?
N: Salvo looks over at Tigger, who stops prepping her gear to smile and make an “I’m gonna cut your throat” sign to him.
C: SALVO
D: They ain’t gonna know what hit ‘em.
N: As Salvo smears eye black under his eyes, we...
S: EXT. THE WHITE OAKS GROUNDS - LATER
N: Sebastian trots through the woods with Ellie trailing.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So what should we do -- camp out or stay on the run?
C: ELLIE
D: Um... how about we do this?
N: Ellie shoots him twice in the stomach.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Jesus! Is there anyone in your family who doesn’t want to shoot me?
C: ELLIE
D: In our defense, the fourth time you shot yourself. But don’t worry...
N: Ellie turns the gun and shoots herself twice in the stomach.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What the hell, Ell? We’re trying to win a war and now we’re both dead!
C: ELLIE
D: Do you really want to keep playing this kid’s game? Or should we go have sex in my childhood fort...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Why are we just standing here? You still haven’t shown me your childhood fort!
E: beat
N: As they laugh and head off, we...
S: EXT. THE WHITE OAKS GROUNDS - SAME TIME
N: Salvo and Doug sneak through another part of the woods, sniping soldiers from the BLUE TEAM as they go.
C: DOUG
D: Rebels on your left!
N: Salvo whips around as they snipe two guys twice in the chest.
C: SALVO
D: Nice shot, kid.
C: DOUG
D: Thanks, Salvo. You too.
N: They trot on, using military signs as they go.
C: DOUG
D: I saw you made my mom look like an Sicilian cab driver. S’up with that?
E: CONT’D
C: SALVO
D: Pretty sure you’re not allowed to criticize other people’s work unless you’ve got a job yourself.
C: DOUG
D: You don’t think I want a job?
C: SALVO
D: No I don’t. Cover me!
N: Doug provides cover as Salvo ducks and snipes a BLUE TEAMER.
C: DOUG
D: I do want to work. It’s just, my dad wants me to come to the hotel company but I want to do something more in line with my skills.
C: SALVO
D: And what are those -- masturbating all winter while your parents pay your phone bill?
C: DOUG
D: That’s not all I do here! I mean, obviously it happens. But only at the beginning of the month when the new catalogues get delivered...
C: SALVO
D: Right, no Internet. ON YOUR RIGHT!
N: Doug drops to a knee and Salvo shoots a BLUE TEAMER over him.
C: SALVO
D: You think my dad wanted me to be a hair stylist? No way. But growing up, I looked at him and thought -- why am I gonna bust my back laying bricks when I could make twice as much hanging out with a buncha hot broads in an air-conditioned salon.
E: CONT’D
C: DOUG
D: I can’t just piss off my parents. They’ll drop me from the payroll.
C: SALVO
D: And that’s the problem. You act like a little kid, so they treat you like one. But at some point you gotta man up and do something.
C: DOUG
D: I don’t act like a little kid!
C: SALVO
D: Yes you do!
C: DOUG
D: DO NOT!
C: SALVO
D: DO TOO! And to be honest? If you were my son, I’d spank that bad attitude right out of you.
N: Doug stares at Salvo like he’s going to say something tough, then starts looking like he’s going to cry and runs away.
C: SALVO
D: Oh for the love of God! Are you seriously running away? Wait! At least slow down! You’re gonna get a cramp!
E: CONT’D calls after him
S: EXT. THE WHITE OAKS GROUNDS - SAME TIME
N: Frank and Lucky catch their breath behind a log.
C: FRANK
D: Okay... I think we lost them.
C: LUCKY
D: Lemme check.
N: Lucky takes off his hat and raises it over the log. It’s immediately pelted by a stream of paintballs.
C: LUCKY
D: Shit, Dad! We’re trapped!
E: CONT’D
C: FRANK
D: Don’t worry, Son. In moments like these, I like to ask myself -- what would our ancestors do?
C: LUCKY
D: Call our friends at the Embassy and see if they can bail us out?
E: thinks, then
C: FRANK
D: I mean the older ones, who actually fought in wars. They would suck it up and face our enemies head on!
C: LUCKY
D: Got it. Dad, have you ever, I dunno, thought about ignoring our ancestors and carving your own path?
C: FRANK
D: Not once, Son. I know the American dream is all about rolling up your sleeves and getting dirty, but tell me something...
E: MORE
C: FRANK
D: When you’re walking in the woods, would you rather tear through the uncut brush or do you prefer to follow the footsteps of those who’ve walked there before you?
E: CONT'D
N: Lucky smiles, understanding.
C: FRANK
D: Be grateful for the path, son. Because a lot of people aren’t lucky enough to have one.
E: CONT’D
C: LUCKY
D: Let’s make our ancestors proud and lay waste to these sons of bitches!
N: Frank and Lucky share a look, then scream and rise up to kick ass... then immediately get lit up by Salvo who is coming out at them with two weapons like John Wick. Frank and Lucky look at their bodies, covered in paint, then each other and shrug.
C: FRANK
D: Or we could go have a scotch.
S: INT. ELLIE’S CHILDHOOD FORT - SAME TIME
N: Sebastian rolls off Ellie. Both are happy and breathing hard.
C: ELLIE
D: Wow. That was... splintery.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’m just glad the mouse left. Guy wouldn’t stop staring me in the eyes.
N: Ellie laughs and cuddles up next to Sebastian.
C: ELLIE
D: Babe, I’m sorry I was acting all crazy yesterday.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You mean after I got offered the chance to run the nicest hotel in America and your first instinct was to run away to Maine?
C: ELLIE
D: Yeah. It’s just my parents, you know? Sometimes they like to wrap their hands around us kids and just squeeze until we can’t move.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Now you’re complaining about having a family that hugs too tight?
C: ELLIE
D: My point is, life could be really good for us in DC. So if you want to move there, I say we do it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Thanks, Ell. I can’t imagine ever leaving my Dad, but... maybe it is time to try something new.
C: ELLIE
D: Well, he does seem to be making more of an effort. Maybe our parents will all end up friends and he’ll end up moving with us?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yeah. Maybe.
E: high-pitched
S: EXT. THE WHITE OAKS GROUNDS - SAME TIME
N: Tigger, in full battle mode, charges through the woods sniping RED TEAMERS as she goes with surprising expertise.
C: TIGGER
D: Sallllvoooo! You can run, but you can’t hide... your cologne.
N: Tigger sniffs the air and finds a jacket poking out from behind a tree. She jumps around the corner and fires...
C: TIGGER
D: Got ya, sucker!
E: CONT’D
N: ...but the bullet hits an empty jacket he’s propped up. As Tigger inspects it, annoyed, the leafy ledge behind her comes to life as Salvo emerges from amidst them, rocking a homemade Ghillie suit he’s put together with moss and leaves. His gun emerges as Salvo takes aim, but Tigger senses the activity and ducks just as he fires. The paintball splatters against the tree as Tigger rolls around and fires back... just as Salvo also jumps to safety behind a tree.
C: TIGGER
D: I’m gonna kill you, buddy!
E: CONT’D
C: SALVO
D: Not if I kill you first!
N: Salvo runs to a new hiding spot as Tigger fires at him. Salvo keeps popping up from different places to fire back. They call to each other during the fight.
C: SALVO
D: Tell me something -- where’d a girl like you learn to fight like this?
E: CONT’D
C: TIGGER
D: Well, I grew up stag hunting with my father in Scotland!
N: She jumps out and fires! He fires back!
C: TIGGER
D: Then I captained the biathlon team at my boarding school!
E: CONT’D
N: She fires again! He fires back!
C: TIGGER
D: But I probably learned most of this from my stint in... THE NAVY!
E: CONT’D
N: Tigger runs across the woods, emptying a clip on the way. Salvo tries to hit her the whole way. Then silence.
C: SALVO
D: Wiat, you’re military? I thought you went to Princeton.
C: TIGGER
D: I enlisted after graduation because I felt I owed it to our country. But mostly to piss off my parents.
C: SALVO
D: Well then... HAPPY FOURTH TO YOU!
N: Salvo jumps out and fires just as she does the same. They both have a perfect shot, but in slo-mo we see their two bullets collide and EXPLODE in a splash of blue and red. It’s amazing. They both look at each other, then can’t help but smile. It’s a fun moment. Maybe in another life...
C: TIGGER
D: To you as well, sir.
N: They salute each other, then instantly fall back into fight mode, chasing each other through the woods, as we...
S: EXT. THE WHITE OAKS GROUNDS - LATER
N: Back at the starting place, the “killed” RED and BLUE TEAMERS sip lemonade and talk about the battle. Lucky and Frank drink scotch as Sebastian and Ellie watch the field.
C: ELLIE
D: There they are! I see them.
N: Ellie points to Salvo and Tigger approaching from afar, both gesticulating wildly.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Ah crap, they’re fighting. Wait, are they fighting?
C: ELLIE
D: I honestly can’t tell. The line between good moods and bad moods is so thin for both of them.
N: ANGLE ON TIGGER AND SALVO: They’re both dirty and covered in paint splotches and definitely in good moods.
C: SALVO
D: Damn, Tigger. That was one hell of a fight.
C: TIGGER
D: I’ll say. I’ve never seen an old man scramble up a tree like that. You sure you’re not half raccoon?
C: SALVO
D: Ha! Where were you when I was planting bombs on North Korean radio towers? You’re twice the man of any soldier in my platoon.
C: TIGGER
D: Yeah, I get that a lot.
N: They laugh, then Salvo softens a bit.
C: SALVO
D: Hey Tig, I just want to say... I’m sorry. For giving you such a high quality style, without permission.
C: TIGGER
D: That’s nice of you to say. Even if your apologies sound more like compliments to yourself.
C: SALVO
D: Well, if I’m being honest, I’ve never given that style to anyone else before. So, really, I think your aura commands a respect I typically only reserve for myself.
C: TIGGER
D: Mm. I guess I’ll take that.
N: As they approach the others, Ellie and Sebastian cross over.
C: ELLIE
D: Where were you guys? We were getting worried.
C: SALVO
D: Eh, just duking it out. Your mom’s quite a fighter.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Look at you guys. It’s like Jackson Pollack started painting on people. Who actually won?
N: Salvo and Tigger look at each other, unsure.
C: TIGGER
D: I’m actually not sure who hit the other person first.
C: SALVO
D: Then let’s say me! No, I’m kidding.
C: TIGGER
D: Yeah, unlike the actual Revolution we may have to call this one a draw.
N: Everyone celebrates that verdict, except Frank.
C: FRANK
D: Well, wait a minute. Where’s Doug?
N: They all look around, not seeing him.
C: TIGGER
D: Is he not here with you guys? I haven’t seen him since the start.
N: Frank and Tigger start calling for him. Others start helping them look around. Salvo goes to the snack table.
C: SALVO
D: Yeah, I’d save your breath. That kid took off a while ago. Are these donuts for everyone?
E: then
C: TIGGER
D: What do you mean he “took off”? Where’d he go?
C: SALVO
D: No clue. We were just talking about his job, or lack thereof, and then he just...
N: Salvo makes the sound and motion of a missile shooting off. He goes to bite the donut, but Tigger bats it away.
C: TIGGER
D: Are you saying he ran away?!
E: concerned
C: SALVO
D: Well, I wouldn’t say “ran.” It was more of a labored trot. Like an old lady trying to beat a walk signal.
C: TIGGER
D: Oh my god. Frank! I think Dougie ran away!
C: FRANK
D: Oh good lord, not again.
C: SALVO
D: “Again”?!
C: FRANK
D: He does this every once in a while. But usually only in the winter, when we forget something on his Christmas list.
C: SALVO
D: Are you kidding with this family?
E: to Sebastian
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Dad, what’d you say to him!
C: SALVO
D: Nothing bad! Just that maybe it was time to start acting like a man and stop mooching off his parents.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Why the hell would you do that?!
C: SALVO
D: The kid needed to hear it!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: No! He didn’t!
C: TIGGER
D: How could you not tell me about this when we were out in the woods?
C: SALVO
D: Didn’t seem like that big of a deal.
C: TIGGER
D: Not that big of a-- Oh I see what’s going on. You think I’m trying to take your son, so you’re trying to drive mine away.
C: SALVO
D: Oh gimme a break. The kid just went somewhere to pout. And at the speed he was moving, he won’t get far.
C: TIGGER
D: Frank, this is a disaster! Our sweet baby boy could be in danger.
C: SALVO
D: I think you’re overreacting. We’re in a gated community! What’s gonna get him -- the HOA fees?
C: FRANK
D: Okay, everyone better spread out!
C: TIGGER
D: Yeah, we gotta find Doug before he gets hurt or kidnapped!
C: SALVO
D: Kidnapped?! The guy’s twenty-six! I was already bald by that age.
N: Sebastian covers Salvo’s mouth as the groups canvases the area. Tigger and Frank look pissed. Ellie’s also worried.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Okay, nobody panic! My dad was a tracker back in the war.
E: MORE
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I promise we’ll find him and bring him home before his bedtime. Right, Dad?
E: CONT'D
C: SALVO
D: Yeah, we’ll find him. But for the record a grown man should not have a bedtime!
E: can’t help it
N: Salvo grabs another donut and walks away, but before he can take a bite, an angry Tigger shoots it out of his hand.
S: EXT. THE WOODS - HOURS LATER
N: It’s now dark as Salvo and a tired, grumpy Sebastian use phone-lights to search. Salvo checks the ground for clues.
C: SALVO
D: I’m pretty sure he went that way.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What, you can tell from footprints?
C: SALVO
D: No. From the Almond Joy wrappers.
N: Salvo points to one and they start moving in that direction. He slaps at bugs that are biting him throughout.
C: SALVO
D: This is unbelievable. What kind of adult man runs away from home?
E: CONT’D
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Drop it, Dad. This is your fault. Try to take some responsibility.
C: SALVO
D: My fault?! I just said what people should’ve said to him years ago.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yeah, well, you don’t have to say what you’re thinking all the time.
C: SALVO
D: It’s ruder not to say it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: No, it isn’t! Jesus, Dad. Why do I feel like you’re doing everything you can to wreck this for me?
C: SALVO
D: “Wreck it? I’m just making an effort, like you asked me to.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yeah, well, that’s my bad. Turns out the only thing worse than you not trying, is you actually trying. Man, I never should’ve let Ellie convince me to bring you here.
E: shakes his head
C: SALVO
D: What do you mean? You invited me!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Because it was the only way I could get my grandma’s ring! I didn’t realize you’d spend the whole time trying to sabotage me.
C: SALVO
D: Sabotage?! What are you-- Every- thing I’m doing, and have ever done, is to give you a better life!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yeah, you like to say that, but now that I’m about to get one, it’s like you’re trying to stop it!
C: SALVO
D: I’m just trying to make sure you don’t make a fool of yourself! By becoming one of these people. I mean, they’re embarrassing!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Don’t you see that this is your problem?! You’re so focused on other people embarrassing them- selves that you can’t see the most embarrassing person... is you.
C: SALVO
D: Pfft. That ain’t true.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Dad, you cooked their mascot, drove their son to run away, and made Tigger look like a drag queen Marlon Brando! I don’t know what’s going on with you, but honestly? I wish I’d never brought you here.
N: This hits Salvo like a ton of bricks. He gets real quiet.
C: SALVO
D: That really what you think?
N: Sebastian’s silence says it all. Salvo nods, forcing a smile, then slaps a big mosquito on his neck.
C: SALVO
D: Damn bugs. They ain’t getting you?
E: CONT’D
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Nah. I, uh... I decided not to go with the signature scent today.
N: Salvo nods again, realizing just how much his son is changing for this new family. Dejected, he then reaches into his pocket and pulls out a beautiful diamond engagement ring. He looks at it for a beat, then offers it to Sebastian.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: No, Dad, you don’t have to--
E: CONT’D
C: SALVO
D: Take it. It’s what your grandma wanted; it’s what you want. And if you mom was still here, she’d tell me to just give you the damn thing.
N: Sebastian takes the ring and studies it in his hand.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Wow. It’s beautiful.
C: SALVO
D: And so is Ellie. You two are lucky to have each other.
N: Salvo forces a smile, then turns to go.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Wait, Dad...
N: Salvo turns back around and looks at Sebastian.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: We still have to find Doug.
E: CONT’D
N: Salvo points to where Doug is sitting lamely up in a tree, using his phone. As Sebastian looks at Doug, back to the ring and to Salvo walking off. It’s truly a bittersweet moment and as Sebastian cradles the ring in his hand and goes to Doug. And as the Sinatra music swells, we... “FORMAGGI E FRUTTA”
S: INT. ELLIE’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
N: Sebastian awakes, then turns over as we see he’s spent the night with Ellie in her bed. She’s still fast asleep.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: The morning after my father gave me the ring, it was the Fourth of July. Which was fitting as I was finally getting my independence...
E: V.O.
N: Sebastian quietly gets dressed and sneaks out. As he opens the door, however, Duke barks loudly. Sebastian hustles by.
S: INT. SEBASTIAN AND SALVO'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Sebastian peeks in to look for Salvo, but see his Dad’s bed is made with his vacation clothes folded neatly nearby.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It was an amazing feeling that I’d looked forward to for a long time. But much like my signature scent, it was also a little bittersweet...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - LATER
N: Sebastian finds Lucky on the porch doing sit-ups.
C: LUCKY
D: Hey. What’s shaking, Sea bass?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Have you seen my father?
C: LUCKY
D: Not for a couple hours. He took off pretty early in your rental car. Said he was going to the airport.
N: Sebastian expected this, but is a little bummed to hear it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Right, yeah. He said he might try to catch an early flight, so he can be at work first thing tomorrow.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Sure, I was ready to spend the rest of my life with Ellie. But could I really enjoy that life if it meant leaving my father behind?
E: V.O.
N: Sebastian crosses off to watch folks jogging and biking by...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And then I got my answer.
E: V.O.
N: Sebastian sees the three remaining peacocks playing together. He shakes his head, recalling this horror.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: If other species could survive without their beloved patriarchs, I suppose I could too. And as odd as it felt, it was time to start preparing for the transition.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - LIBRARY - DAY
N: Sebastian sits across from Frank and Tigger, smiling.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: ...so on top of accepting your very generous offer to run The Barrymore I would also love to ask for your permission to propose to Ellie.
N: Sebastian unearths the ring to show his intention. Frank and Tigger share a nervous “I don’t know” look. Sebastian starts to panic, then Frank and Tigger break, laughing.
C: FRANK
D: Dude, we’re kidding! You should’ve seen the look on your face.
C: TIGGER
D: Honestly, Sebastian? This makes us both so happy.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Serious? Don’t mess with me.
C: FRANK
D: Our answer is an emphatic yes! We love you and can’t wait to have you and Ellie join the party in DC.
C: TIGGER
D: This is perfect! We’re doing our family photo in an hour. You can propose there and then be in it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Thank god! I was genuinely nervous about how you’d react after, you know, everything that happened with my father this weekend.
C: FRANK
D: Oh, don’t be silly! We’ve enjoyed having him.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You don’t have to say that. He’s been such a disaster. With Doug, and your hair and...
N: Sebastian eyes the peacocks still crossing the lawn.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Everything else.
E: CONT’D
C: TIGGER
D: Eh, he’s a bit like sambuca -- a pretty strong taste that’s bearable if you brace yourself for it. And this probably sounds crazy, but the hair’s kinda growing on me.
E: then
N: Sebastian laughs, then stops.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Wait, you’re serious?
C: TIGGER
D: I am! It’s less maintenance, I feel tougher, and I didn’t have to wear a visor at tennis this morning...
C: FRANK
D: Also helps that she’s been getting an incredible online response from her last spot on MSNBC.
C: TIGGER
D: I didn’t get to say this before he left but... I feel like I’ve been waiting my whole life for this cut.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: His ego would literally explode if he heard you say that, but he still should’ve asked you.
E: MORE
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I honestly don’t know what’s been going on with him. Since my mom passed, he’s just been acting crazier and crazier.
E: CONT'D
C: TIGGER
D: Well, the guy really prides himself on family. My guess is he’s just nervous to lose you.
N: This lands with Sebastian, who thinks on it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yeah. But maybe it’s time for him to move on, too. I mean, you should see the number of women who hit on him back in the salon. Guy could make a killing as a gigolo.
N: They all chuckle at that, then Doug knock/enters, excited.
C: DOUG
D: Mom, Dad, I have an announcement!
C: FRANK
D: What is it, son?
N: Doug takes a deep breath, then proclaims:
C: DOUG
D: I don’t want to work for the family company.
C: FRANK
D: That’s the announcement? You’ve made that pretty clear over the years by, you know, not doing it.
C: TIGGER
D: Yeah, it’s a beautiful day. Why don’t you go outside and play?
C: DOUG
D: Argh, stop talking to me like I’m a little kid when I’m not! God!
N: Doug stomps his foot, petulantly, the resets himself.
C: DOUG
D: I’ve actually decided I want to do something important with my life.
E: CONT’D
C: FRANK / TIGGER
D: What? / Really?
C: TIGGER
D: Dougie, did something happen to you while you ran away?
C: DOUG
D: I didn’t “run away”, Mom! For a while now I’ve been feeling lost and like a loser and, well, after talking to Salvo, I realized I want to do something real, you know? Something that makes a difference. So, I ran to the only spot in this stupid resort where you can get cell reception so I could...
N: Doug takes a deep breath as Frank and Tigger.
C: FRANK
D: Please don’t say masturbate.
E: under his breath
C: DOUG
D: ...sign up for the Army.
C: TIGGER / FRANK
D: What?! / Oh my goodness.
C: FRANK
D: Douglas! Are you serious?
C: DOUG
D: Yes! I chatted with a recruiter and they said I can use my video game skills to fly drones and other shit that might help our country, just like Mom did, and all the other great Collins men who have served.
N: Frank and Tigger share a look, then turn back to Doug.
C: FRANK
D: Well, Doug, that’s... wonderful!
C: TIGGER
D: It really is, sweetie. I’m so proud of you for finding a calling.
C: DOUG
D: Right? I’m already a natural at blowing shit up online; now I’ll get to do it in real life!
N: Doug turns to leave, then turns back to Sebastian.
C: DOUG
D: You know, your dad’s kind of a dick, but man... He really tells people what they need to hear.
E: CONT’D
N: As Doug exits, Sebastian further contemplates the effect his father seems to have had on this family. Then shakes it off as Frank pops a bottle of champagne to celebrate the moment.
S: EXT. THE COLLINS ESTATE - DAY
N: A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER sets up his equipment as Lucky and Doug prepare for the photo. Sebastian paces, nervously, near Frank and Tigger, who spots Ellie.
C: TIGGER
D: Here she comes! Here she comes!
N: Tiggers point to Ellie, who approaches with a head of steam. Frank pats Sebastian on the back, encouragingly.
C: FRANK
D: You got this, big guy! Everybody else act natural.
E: to the others
N: Frank and Tigger act so unnatural, as Sebastian reaches into his pocket to hold the ring. The photographer starts taking pictures as Ellie gets closer and Sebastian tries to smile.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: This was moment of truth. I’d originally wanted to come to Virginia without my dad, so I could propose to Ellie and start my new life with her. But now that I was there, something was just... off.
E: V.O.
N: Ellie arrives. She’s carrying the fancy “Collins Hotel Group” portfolio and does not look happy.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Hey, Ell! I--
C: ELLIE
D: The answer is no, Sebastian!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What?! I haven’t even asked you anything yet!
C: ELLIE
D: Well, we’re not doing it. We’re not taking the job, we’re not moving to DC, we’re not going to spend any more time with these manipulators!
N: Frank and Tigger are completely taken aback.
C: TIGGER
D: Honey, what are you talking about?
N: Ellie holds up the portfolio, flipping through pages.
C: ELLIE
D: Oh, I don’t know -- The Tunbridge Hotel in Mayfair! The Dresden in Geneva! The Shangri-La in Sydney! What do they all have in common?
C: FRANK
D: A five star experience at a three star price? Why are you so angry?
C: ELLIE
D: The answer is: THEIR LOBBY ART!
C: TIGGER
D: Uh oh.
N: Frank and Tigger look busted, while Sebastian is confused.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Babe, what’s going on?
C: ELLIE
D: Look at these pictures. You notice anything familiar about the walls?
N: Ellie flips through them again for Sebastian to see.
C: ELLIE
D: My painting! My painting! My painting! Oooh, what’s this one? Oh yeah, MY PAINTING!
E: CONT’D
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh my god.
C: TIGGER
D: Ellie, we can explain.
C: ELLIE
D: What, that I thought I’d been selling my work to this cool new designer when really you two just hired her to buy my pieces?
C: FRANK
D: That’s technically accurate, but we do think your work is amazing! And what could be better to hang in our family hotels than paintings done by an actual Collins daughter?
C: LUCKY
D: Wait a sec, aren’t your paintings all pretty... vaginal?
C: FRANK
D: Sure, if you hang them vertically. But on their side they look more like sunsets.
N: Frank shows the Portfolio pictures. Lucky nods, convinced.
C: ELLIE
D: Ugh! Here, I thought I was kicking ass in the art world -- selling out my shows to private buyers -- but turns out I’m just getting the same allowance I got my whole life in a much more screwed up way. I might as well have just hung out and played video games all day!
C: DOUG
D: Feels like an unnecessary shot at the ol’ Dougster.
C: TIGGER
D: Baby, we’re sorry we didn’t tell you. It’s just... the art world can be so cruel. We wanted to help you get a jumpstart.
C: ELLIE
D: And that’s what you’ve done our whole lives -- bribing our way on to sports teams, rewriting our college essays, hiring rappers to emcee our birthday parties.
C: LUCKY
D: You’re great parents! Don’t let her guilt you into changing your ways!
C: ELLIE
D: All I want is to feel like I’m accomplishing stuff on my own, you know? Like you did, Mom. When you joined the Navy and then stormed your way into politics.
C: TIGGER
D: That was hard though. My parents never supported me. And we just hate to see our kids suffer.
C: ELLIE
D: Sometimes suffering can be good! You know, one of the many reasons I love being with Sebastian is because he’s such a hard worker and when we’re together, I feel like we’re tackling life on our own terms. And now I feel like this whole weekend has just been one big elaborate ruse to get us to move into back into your bubble and I’m sorry but I just don’t want this kind of help.
E: takes Sebastian’s hand
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And that was the moment everything finally started to make sense.
E: V.O.
N: This lands with Tigger and Frank, who smile sympathetically.
C: TIGGER
D: We’re so sorry, Ellie. We should’ve told you what we were doing.
C: ELLIE
D: Yeah. You should’ve.
N: Ellie sighs and turns to Sebastian, who is deep in thought.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Here I was, the son of an Italian immigrant, about to propose to the girl of my dreams, and join one of the most prominent families in America, and I was going to do it without the man who’d raised me to be the guy Ellie fell in love with.
E: V.O.
C: ELLIE
D: I’m sorry, babe -- did you have something you wanted to ask me?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yeah, I uh... do have a question.
N: Sebastian plays with the ring inside his pocket...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Standing there, I realized I had everything I wanted; but not what I needed. And that was my lifelong hero by my side while I made the most important decision of my life.
E: V.O.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What time does the evening flight leave for Chicago?
C: TIGGER
D: I think it takes off at six.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I want to continue this convo, Ell. But right now I need to go talk to my father.
C: ELLIE
D: But it’s 5:30. There’s no way you can get to the airport in time.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: There is one way. Lucky?
N: Sebastian takes a huge deep breath, then turns to Lucky and channels the intensity of Arnold Schwarzenegger as he says...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Get me to the chopper.
E: CONT’D
N: As the Sinatra-music kicks on, we...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: “DOLCE”
S: EXT. RURAL VIRGINIA - ESTABLISHING SHOT
N: A helicopter soars over a gorgeous mountainous vista.
C: LUCKY
D: How you doing back there, Sea Bass?
E: O.S.
S: INT. LUCKY'S HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
N: Lucky turns around to see Sebastian absolutely dying, as he wheezes and tries to shed layers while buckled in.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Not good, Luck! NOT GOOD!
C: LUCKY
D: Want me to turn around?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: No! It’s just so hot! And I can’t breathe! Keep going, I’m fine!
N: As he turns and vomits out the window, we...
S: EXT. REMOTE VIRGINIA AIRPORT - DAY
N: As the chopper blades slow, Sebastian jumps out in underwear. He puts his clothes back on as he races toward the entrance.
S: INT. REMOTE VIRGINIA AIRPORT - DAY
N: The two overweight TSA AGENTS from the beginning take turns throwing donut holes over the x-ray machine, trying to land them in each other’s mouths. A GATE ATTENDANT cleans up the gate after what is clearly a completed boarding process as Sebastian (now dressed but still sweaty) bursts in..
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Has the plane left for Chicago?!
C: GATE ATTENDANT
D: No, but that flight is closed. It’s already taxiing on the runway. Sir, would you like a towel?
E: off his appearance
C: SEBASTIAN
D: No! Please! I need to talk to someone on that plane!
C: GATE ATTENDANT
D: Yeah, that’s not gonna happen.
N: The TSA Agents step behind her to reinforce her point.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Okay, I’m sorry. Thanks.
N: Sebastian turns away and as they all stand down, he does a Michael Jackson-style dance move to spin around the metal detector, then sprints past them out onto the tarmac.
S: EXT. REMOTE VIRGINIA AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS
N: SEBASTIAN bursts from the airport, sprinting to the plane. The TSA Officers chase after him, calling out:
C: TSA OFFICER
D: Sir, stop! You can’t be out here!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: All due respect, Officer Man Boobs! But I gotta stop that plane!
N: The TSA Officers double over with cramps. One dry heaves as Sebastian races ahead, heading off the plane.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Stop the plane! Please! I need to tell you something!
E: CONT’D
N: The plane grinds to a halt. The door opens and lowers to the ground, and it’s Salvo who gets off.
C: SALVO
D: What are you doing, son? And why does it look like you swam here?
N: Sebastian looks at his father and takes a deep breath.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Look, Dad. I came here to say that I know you can be stubborn, cheap, obnoxious and severely judgmental. And for the past year, I’ve been wondering if I should check you into a mental institution.
C: SALVO
D: Son, if you don’t bend this around to a compliment soon, I’m gonna get back on that plane.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: But the truth is, those quirks are part of what makes you the greatest Dad I ever could’ve ever hoped for.
C: SALVO
D: I’m listening...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Sure, it ain’t always easy being your son, but the way you raised me... it’s why I’m the man I am today. The same man who, for some reason, Ellie seems to love.
C: SALVO
D: Yeah, I’ve never been able to put my finger on that one either. But you got my mother’s ring. You can propose to her. What else do you need from me?
E: then
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I need you to be a part of our lives.
C: SALVO
D: But you said I was embarrassing.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Whatever you are, I love it. And the truth is you haven’t changed since I was a kid; but I have. Which is why I’ve stopped realizing that... that... you’re my hero.
E: getting emotional
C: SALVO
D: Stop it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It’s true, Dad. You’ve sacrificed so much and everything that’s good in my life, I owe it to you.
C: SALVO
D: No. It’s because good things happen to good kids. And honestly I have been acting crazier, because... I brought you to America to give you a chance at a better life, but now that you’re about to get it...
E: also getting emotional fully choked up MORE
C: SALVO
D: I’m afraid once you gonna marry Ellie, I’m gonna lose the last family I’ve got.
E: CONT'D
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Dad, don’t you cry or I’m gonna...
E: starting to cry
C: SALVO
D: I can’t help it.
E: also starting to cry
N: Both men fully start crying, standing stoically face-to-face, marinating in the thick tears rolling down their cheeks.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You’re never gonna lose me, Dad! I want you to be in my life forever! Whether it’s Chicago or D.C. or wherever, so you can help me instill the same values in my kids that you instilled in me.
C: SALVO
D: That’s all what I want, too!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I love you, Dad!
C: SALVO
D: I love you too, Sebastian! You hear that, my love! I told you we couldn’t leave this beautiful boy in that orphanage!
E: to sky, in Italian
N: Salvo and Sebastian hug each other, still fully crying, as we reveal the TSA Agents watching, both way freaked out.
C: GATE ATTENDANT
D: Back-up is on its way. What’s the situation out there, guys?
E: O.S. over Walkie-Talkie
C: TSA OFFICER
D: I’m not sure. Do we have an emergency code for “Two Grown Men Crying on the Tarmac”?
N: As Salvo and Sebastian continue the emotional embrace, we... “DIGESTIVO”
S: EXT. THE VILLAGE OF WHITE OAK - THAT EVENING
N: The town is abuzz with a patriotic parade, as wealthy people dressed in red, white, and blue walk and ride on firetrucks, convertibles, and golf-carts-turned-parade-floats. Frank, Doug, and Tigger (all in military uniforms) ride atop their golf-cart-turned-Navy-ship with Frank steering. Tigger leans into Ellie, who smiles, but is clearly still annoyed.
C: TIGGER
D: You wanna do the honors?
N: Ellie shrugs and presses a button, cuing a big navy FOGHORN. Several parade viewers fall over from the blast.
C: DOUG
D: Oh snap! Here they come!
N: Doug points to Lucky’s helicopter drop from the sky and prep to land in front of the parade, with Sebastian and Salvo leaning proudly out of it. As it lowers, Sebastian jumps off and walks confidently to Ellie, with Salvo close behind.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Eleanor Mallory Collins! Can I please have a word with you?
N: Ellie can’t help but be a bit embarrassed as she goes to him.
C: ELLIE
D: What the heck are you doing, babe? You’re making such a big scene.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: We’ve earned it, babe. Now...
N: Sebastian gets down on one knee, as everyone watches, including Frank, Tigger, Doug, and Lucky who venture over.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Ellie, I’ve recently come to appreciate the fact that nothing in life is more important than family. Sure, they may be embarrassing. And smothering. And sometimes express their love in a way that’s pretty--
E: CONT’D
C: ELLIE
D: Fucked up?
N: Frank and Tigger take each other’s hands, feeling guilty.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Exactly. But at the end of the day, they’re not doing it because they’re malicious; they’re just trying to do what’s best for us, no matter what, with the tools they inherited from their own parents.
N: This makes sense. Ellie looks over at her parents. They mouth sorry. She smiles, forgiving them a bit.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So in this moment, surrounded by our beautiful families -- and these complete random strangers -- would you make me the luckiest man on Earth and marry me? So we can make our own family, full of tiny kids who will one day think we’re the most embarrassing people on Earth?!
E: CONT’D
N: Sebastian offers his grandmother’s ring. Ellie smiles huge.
C: ELLIE
D: Yes! Of course I will, YES! WE’LL BE THE MOST EMBARRASSING PARENTS THEY CAN EVER IMAGINE!
N: Everyone cheers. And as Sebastian slides the ring over her finger, Salvo, Frank, and Tigger come over to give them congratulatory hugs. As they do, the village fireworks start going off in the background. It’s a huge display.
C: TIGGER
D: Oh my god, the fireworks! This will make the perfect family photo!
C: DOUG
D: I’m on it.
N: Doug hands his phone to a stranger, then joins the others for a big group photo. It’s an amazing scene as both families gather together and the camera captures a series of shots.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And there you have it, folks: An a- typical American love story about a man reconnecting with his hero of a father, and two different brands of immigrant families coming together.
E: V.O.
N: In the family photo, Sebastian finds himself right where he wants to be -- with an arm around his father and Ellie.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So you can start crunching that popcorn and grab your phones to check how few people texted you, because there’s nothing left for us to do but start planning a wedding. Which should be easy enough...
C: FRANK
D: Congratulations, guys. Of course, Tigger and I would love to have the wedding at our chapel in D.C.
C: SALVO
D: D.C.? I was thinking Sicily. We could have the whole ceremony in my grandfather’s garden.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: There’s a lot of time to figure it out. And all that matters is we’re all together.
N: They all share a happy moment, then Doug notices something.
C: DOUG
D: Is that Duke over there? And what’s he carrying?
N: The whole town looks to see the Collins’ large dog coming out of the woods dragging... As he gets closer, everyone sees he’s carrying THE FUCKING PEACOCK CARCASS!
C: FRANK
D: Oh my god, is that Sgt. Feathers?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Holy shit!
N: Sebastian and Salvo share a terrified look, then yell:
C: SALVO SEBASTIAN
D: Duke murdered a peacock! Duke murdered a peacock!
E: CONT'D
N: And on our father and son Maniscalco back in sync and surviving yet another disaster via FAMILY, we...
T: FADE TO BLACK.
