S: EXT. REMOTE VIRGINIA AIRPORT - DAY

N: A small prop plane taxis toward the runway. It’s a serene
N: scene, with a beautiful mountainous backdrop, until...
0: 
N: SEBASTIAN bursts from the airport, sprinting to the plane.
N: Two overweight TSA OFFICERS chase after him, calling out:
0: 
C:                      TSA OFFICER
D:            Sir, stop! You can’t be out here!
0: 
C:                      SEBASTIAN
D:            All due respect, Officer Man Boobs!
D:            But I gotta stop that plane!
0: 
N: As they lumber after him, we hear Sebastian in Voice Over...
0: 
C:                      SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
D:            At this point, you’re probably
D:            asking two questions: One, “don't
D:            the guys in charge of protecting
D:            our airports from terrorists have
D:            to pass some sort of physical?”
0: 
N: The TSA Officers double over with cramps. One starts to dry
N: heave as Sebastian races ahead, heading off the plane.
0: 
C:                      SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
D:            And more importantly, “did we
D:            really just drop a bunch of cash to
D:            watch some typical American run-to-
D:            the-airport rom-com?” Well you can
D:            relax ‘cause the answer is no.
0: 
C:                      SEBASTIAN
D:            Stop the plane! Please! I need to
D:            tell you something!
0: 
N: The plane grinds to a halt. The door opens and lowers to the
N: ground, but before we see who’s getting off, we hear...
0: 
C:                      SEBASTIAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
D:            So put your damn Instagram away, go
D:            light on the popcorn crunch and just
D:            sit back and enjoy the ride. ‘Cause
D:            while this is a love story, I
D:            promise it’s anything but typical.

D:            Like most American stories, my
D:            family’s started a long time ago on
D:            another continent... specifically,
D:            the magical island of Sicilia.

N: We cross the Atlantic, then push in toward the map of Italy.
0: 
C:                      SEBASTIAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
D:            Lot of folks like to call Sicily
D:            the big ball in front of the boot
D:            of Italy, which makes sense ‘cause
D:            the world’s been trying to kick our
D:            ass since the dawn of time.

N: We show footage of the following real life catastrophes...

C:                      SEBASTIAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
D:            For generations, our people have
D:            been threatened by wars, volcanoes,
D:            testicle-crushing Speedos...
0:

C:                      SEBASTIAN (V.O.)(CONT’D)

D:            ancestors. All those clothes? Hand-
D:            stitched by my great-grandmother. And
D:            that food on the table? Harvested
D:            from a garden planted by my great-
D:            grandfather.

D:            resting bitch face -- like a bunch

D:           For centuries, the hunchbacked men
D:           in my family have operated with one
D:           goal: Do everything you can to give
D:           your family a better life than you
D:           had. Now this doesn’t mean spoiling
D:           ‘em like the kids I see today

D:           For my father, this meant leaving
D:           his beloved Sicily for Chicago so
D:           he and my mother could give me
D:           opportunities he never got... like
D:           learning how to dance like Michael
D:           Jackson... growing a mullet... and
D:           blowing three hundred bucks on
D:           professional glamour photos...

D:           My mother was right -- screw all
D:           those modeling agencies that never
D:           called me back -- I’m beautiful.
E:               (then)
D:           So while my modeling career failed
D:           to materialize, my father busted
D:           his literal hump to support us and
D:           to instill in me certain rules of
D:           how a man should live his life...

D:           and now I just needed the ring.
D:           Which should’ve been easy to get...

C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           What do you mean, you won’t give me
D:           the ring? Grandma left it for me to
D:           use when I’m ready to get married.

C:                     SALVO (O.S.)
D:           No! She left it with me, so I can
D:           make sure you don’t just give it
D:           away to some random girl.

D:           Can you please come out of the damn
D:           garden so we can talk about this?!

N: Salvo emerges from the plants, like a sniper. He’s now older --
N: with his spine even more curved, and his pony-tailed hair
N: balding in the front -- but arguably prouder than ever, as he
N: rises, sweaty and shirtless, with a bandana tied around his
N: head, and dirt caked into his face and chest hair.

N: Sebastian does a spot-on impression of his flamboyant dad
N: judging people around him. Oblivious, Salvo does the exact
N: same motions as he complains about Sebastian to his clients.
0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           Ah, I see. He’s worried about his
D:           immigrant father making him look
D:           like some kind of Goomba.

N: A small prop plane grinds to a halt. As Ellie, Sebastian, and
N: Salvo disembark, we hear the following VO:

C:                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
D:           Growing up, my father took me on
D:           exactly one “vacation” -- a three-
D:           day trip to Memphis where we spent
D:           two hours looking through the fence
D:           at Graceland... and the rest of the
D:           time filling up a U-Haul with used
D:           salon equipment he’d bought from a
D:           bankrupt hairdresser. So, going on
D:           a trip with him was kinda fun...
0: 
N: Ellie takes a big huff of the country air, invigorated.

C:                     ELLIE
D:           Oh my gosh, the air is so fresh!
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
D:           ...but mostly it was strange.
0: 
N: Sebastian goes to breathe it in, but coughs on a big cloud of
N: smoke. REVEAL: Salvo trailing, having just lit a Jewel Cigar.
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           Dad, you can’t smoke here.

C:                     SALVO
D:           Pfft. You sound just like that
D:           uppity stewardess.
0: 
N: Salvo takes another big drag and Sebastian dodges the exhale.

C:                     ELLIE
D:           Isn’t this so beautiful, Salvo?

C:                     SALVO
D:           Sounds like a white collar prison.

D:           The guy was clearly uncomfortable,
D:           so I tried to put him at ease by
D:           speaking his language: cheap.
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           So Dad, I got some good news.
D:           Through one of my hotel connects, I
D:           was able to secure us a luxury
D:           sedan for the price of a compact.
0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           Nice work. But makes me wonder what

0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           And then! I used that price to get

N: a purebred horse brought to life). He’s dressed in a flight
N: suit and holds a helicopter helmet under his arms.

D:           While I’d made some progress with
D:           Ellie’s parents, I’d made none with
D:           her older brother. His name was
D:           Frances Love Collins the 13th, so
D:           everyone called him “Lucky”. And
D:           that’s exactly what this dude was.

D:           your way into college, Lucky was on

D:           In the meantime, he was working as

N: Ellie stops next to a pond, where a family of peacocks waddle
N: across the road. A nearby sign shows: “Peacock Crossing.”

C:                     SALVO
D:           Virginia’s got peacocks?!
0: 
C:                     ELLIE
D:           No. My grandfather’s friend brought
D:           them here as pets years ago, but
D:           they didn’t like their cages so he
D:           just decided to let them roam free.
D:           Now, they’ve pretty much become the
D:           official mascots of our club.
0: 
N: As Ellie drives on, Salvo watches the peacocks waddle away.
0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           How much a peacock cost anyway?
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           Don’t answer that, El.
0: 
C:                     ELLIE
D:           Copy that. And this is our house!
0: 
N: Sebastian and Salvo lay their eyes on a small structure, then
N: share an unimpressed look.
0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           Huh. No offense, but I expected
D:           something a little bigger.
0: 
C:                     ELLIE
D:           Oh, sorry, no. That’s just my
D:           little brother’s converted barn.
D:           That is the main house.
0: 
N: Sebastian and Salvo turn to see a magnificent property.

N: Ellie parks in front of a huge house, where Frank and Tigger
N: (in golf clothes and tennis whites, respectively) wait for
N: them with Lucky and DUKE, an energetic Irish Wolfhound.

D:           Lotta parents hug their kids, Dad.
D:           Unlike you, who first saw me in the
D:           delivery room and chose to shake my
D:           hand.
0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           You were covered in placenta! Plus,

N: Duke the dog charges over and starts jumping on them.
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
D:           Looking back, this all had to be a
D:           little overwhelming for my father.
D:           Unlike him, I’d had time to realize
D:           that there’s a certain formula to
D:           wealthy families. Starting with the
D:           tough mom who’s always dressed for
D:           the sport she’s about to play...
0: 
N: Tigger (in tennis whites) turns to Sebastian and Salvo.
0: 
C:                     TIGGER
D:           Sebastian! Hi babe! Sorry I’m not
D:           dressed up, but I’ve got a doubles
D:           match after lunch.
0: 
N: Tigger turns to Salvo, as they size each other up with their
N: respective, domineering Type-A energy. And like two magnets,
N: they’re riding a fine line between attraction and repulsion.
0: 
C:                     TIGGER (CONT’D)
D:           And you must be the charming father
D:           who gets to spend way more time
D:           with my daughter than I do!
0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           Nice to finally meet you in person,
D:           Tigger. Just last week, I was
D:           checking out your highlights on TV.

D:           It’s like a block of marble I just
D:           want to sink my tools into. Have
D:           you ever thought about--
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           Okay, Dad. Please stop touching
D:           other people’s heads.
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
D:           Next up is the self-deprecating
D:           father who’s usually still dressed
D:           from the sport he just finished.
0: 
C:                     FRANK
D:           Yes, we’ve heard you’re quite the
D:           stylist, Salvo! Anything you can do
D:           to help me?
0: 
N: Frank removes his golfer’s hat to reveal his bald head. He
N: laughs hard at his own joke. Salvo doesn’t really think it’s
N: that funny, but the others join in. Especially Lucky.
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
D:           ...then their oldest kid who still
D:           gets an allowance from the family,
D:           so he treats his father like most
D:           of us would treat a boss.

C:                     LUCKY
D:           Good one, sir! Alright, I’m gonna
D:           go hit the links. Hit me up on my
D:           private line if you need anything.
0: 
N: Lucky salutes Frank, then speeds off in a golf cart, nearly
N: hitting Sebastian.
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
D:           Also, a second, more independent
D:           child who both parents wish would
D:           spend more time with the family...

0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           I never treated you like that. I
D:           didn’t want you to get a big head.
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           Mission accomplished.

D:           And then there are some fun bonus
D:           options, like a giant dog the
D:           family refuses to discipline...
0: 
N: Duke keeps jumping up on Sebastian and trying to jam his nose
N: in his crotch. No one does anything to try and stop him.
0: 
C:                     FRANK
D:           Don’t mind Duke. He likes attention
D:           ‘cause he’s a millennial!
0: 
N: Frank laughs at his bad joke. Ellie and Tigger join in. Salvo
N: looks at Sebastian like -- what the fuck are we laughing at?
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
D:           And a weird third kid that everyone

0: 
N: Tigger sees Salvo staring at DOUG (20s, out-of-shape, thinks
N: it’s cool to have a beard, but really he’s just too lazy to
N: shave) as he meditates by his house in full yoga gear.

D:           Yup. This was gonna be a lot for my
D:           old man to handle. So much like the
D:           old waterbed he slept in at home, I
D:           was gonna have to help ease him in.
0: 
C:                     TIGGER
D:           So is anybody hungry for lunch? We
D:           could go down to “The Shack.”
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           What do you think, Dad? I could eat.
0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           Thanks, but I already had some food
D:           I brought on the flight. Packed
D:           enough for three, but these guys
D:           didn’t want any.
0: 
C:                     ELLIE
D:           Yeah, for some reason I wasn’t in
D:           the mood for sardines and taleggio
D:           cheese. Possibly ‘cause it made the
D:           whole plane smell like a wet sock.
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           He used to send me to school with
D:           meals like that. I was the only kid
D:           in first grade who had to
D:           refrigerate his lunchbox.

N: Everyone chuckles, as Sebastian gives Salvo a pointed look.

C:                     SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
D:           But we’d love to go, right Dad?

D:           Yes, I suppose it has been built up

0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           This menu. It ain’t got no prices.
0: 
C:                     ELLIE
D:           Oh, don’t worry about it, Salvo.
D:           They just put it on our account.

N: Confused, Salvo looks to Sebastian, who nervously pivots:

C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           And wow, these tables are gorgeous!
0: 
C:                     TIGGER
D:           Yes! If you look underneath,
D:           they’re actually wagon wheels
D:           salvaged from the original carts
D:           that brought all the materials up
D:           to build White Oak.

E:               (to Sebastian)

D:           Sure, a lot of the south has a...

C:                     TIGGER
D:           “She” is a person emailing you from
D:           Africa, and to whom you are sending

D:           Don’t you want a starter?
E:               (poking his tummy)

C:                     FRANK
D:           Salvo, I know this sounds silly but
D:           the ethos of this place is “getting
D:           away from regular life”. That’s why
D:           we have no cell towers or Internet
D:           or newspapers, and we don’t like to
D:           put prices on things as that’s just
D:           an annoying reminder of money.

D:           So... all this food is free?
0:

D:           You’re supposed to be getting to

C:                     SALVO
D:           Pfft, to me, and everyone else in
D:           the world! They like to “take a
D:           break from thinking about money”?
D:           Are you kidding me? Where I come
D:           from, that’s called dying.
0: 
N: Sebastian breaks a little, chuckling. He knows this is weird.

D:           Hell yeah it is! Everyone dresses
D:           like we’re on a cruise. The men got
D:           hands so soft, I thought my
D:           callouses were gonna draw blood.
D:           And you notice how they downplay
D:           how fancy everything is? Like I
D:           can’t see with my own eyes.
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           Oh I’ve definitely noticed that.
E:               (doing an impression)
D:           The house is sixty thousand square
D:           feet and has thirteen bedrooms, but
D:           we like it ‘cause it’s cosy.

D:           Then they do the opposite with the

C:                     SALVO
D:           I know! It’s like you can’t just

D:           The only story behind the furniture
D:           in our house was, “You saw a La-Z-
D:           Boy out on the street, then pulled
D:           me out of school to go get it and
D:           now I don’t know geometry.”

D:           Hey. In my experience, how to spot
D:           a good deal is way more useful than
D:           knowing how to draw a triangle.
E:               (then)
D:           Night cologne?

D:           But Dad, I just want to remind you
D:           that we’re here because I want to
D:           marry Ellie. So try to give her

0: 
C:                     FRANK
D:           It’s a little relaxation technique

D:           Up until then, my worst nightmare
D:           had been my father seeing me enjoy
D:           this life, but at that moment I
D:           realized I still had to prove I
D:           could be a good addition to Ellie’s
D:           family. So thanks to the topspin
D:           kick serve I’d learned from a
D:           Swedish pro named Johannes... this
D:           would be the point of no return.

N: Defiant, Sebastian takes a deep breath then rips off his tear-

D:           Sebastian? As a lifelong hotelier
D:           and father of the greatest girl in
D:           the world, I have to say it kills

C:                     SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
D:           After our fight, I woke up nervous.
D:           That was the first time I’d yelled
D:           at my father like that and I was
D:           scared to see how he’d respond.
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           Hey, good morning, gents.
0: 
C:                     FRANK
D:           Heyyy! There he is.

C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           What? Lucky, it’s me. Sebastian.
0: 
C:                     LUCKY
D:           Oh, right. You look so different
D:           without your crotch on display.
0: 
C:                     FRANK
D:           Ignore him. How’d you sleep, buddy?
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           Not bad. Have you seen my dad?
0: 
C:                     FRANK
D:           I think he’s still out on a walk
D:           with Ellie, Doug, and Tigger.

C:                     FRANK
D:           Yeah, they should be back any
D:           minute. Sit down and eat.

N: Sebastian looks outside the house and sees a whole new Salvo

D:           ...so I says to him, I say, “Why
D:           would I buy you a skateboard, when
D:           I can build you one instead!”
0: 
N: They all laugh hard as they enter the house. Sebastian takes
N: in the marvel that is Salvo in vacation-mode.
0: 
C:                     SALVO (CONT’D)
D:           Hey there, sleepy-head! I was just
D:           telling them about the time I gave
D:           you a skateboard for Christmas.
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           Let me guess -- you skipped the
D:           part where the wheels locked up and
D:           I had to have skin from my ass
D:           grafted onto my face?
0: 
N: Salvo reaches over and rubs Sebastian’s cheek affectionately.
0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           That’s how it stays so smooth!

C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           When did you get up anyway?
0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           Early! But I didn’t want to wake
D:           you, so I snuck out, watched some
D:           news, did my laundry, fixed the
D:           bannister, reorganized the spice
D:           rack... and then the sun came up,
D:           so I started cooking breakfast. And
D:           then I went for a walk so I could
D:           get to know the family. Good people
D:           these Collins. Even the weird one.
0: 
N: Doug stops chewing a cinnamon roll to wonder if that’s about
N: him. Still processing, Sebastian takes in his “new dad”.

D:           What’s the matter? I’m just trying

0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           And I appreciate that. It’s just...
D:           the shorts.

0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           Oh yeah, they’re a little pale.
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           And so many veins. I can’t tell if
D:           those are your legs or the map your
D:           platoon used to find Ho Chi Minh.

C:                     SALVO
D:           All I know is, I feel great, it’s a
D:           sunny day, and Frank, I’d love to
D:           make you guys a proper Italian
D:           dinner tonight. As a thank you for
D:           letting us stay at your place.
0: 
C:                     FRANK
D:           Oh, Salvo. That’s not necessary. We
D:           don’t keep a lot of food here and
D:           the market’s closed for the holiday.
0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           Don’t worry -- a Maniscalco always
D:           finds a way to feed his family.
0: 
C:                     FRANK
D:           Well, alright then. That would be
D:           lovely. Thank you, Salvo!
0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           My pleasure! Now you kids go have
D:           fun, play your tennis, sail your
D:           boats, do whatever you need to do
D:           to work up an appetite for the best
D:           meal of your lives.

N: Salvo gives Sebastian a look “See, I’m trying.”

E:               (re: Sebastian)

N: They’re making pleasure noises like intense flav-or-gasms.
0: 
C:                     FRANK
D:           Salvo, this is delicious. I can’t
D:           believe you put this all together
D:           with what we had in the house.
0: 
C:                     SALVO
D:           I told you I could make it happen!
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           My guess is he raided the kitchen
D:           at “The Shack”. You might wanna ask
D:           Gloria to check the inventory.

0: 
C:                     SALVO

D:           It’s the least I could do, given
D:           all you’re offering my son.
E:               (raises his glass)
D:           La famiglia non è una cosa

D:           Yeah! Let’s move to Maine and open
D:           a bed-and-breakfast. You could run
D:           it, I’ll build a studio, and in
D:           between we could work on populating
D:           the world with happier Maniscalcos.

C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           I definitely like the lots of sex
D:           part but where’s this is coming
D:           from? It’s going so well in there.
D:           Like, our families are actually
D:           getting along.
0: 
C:                     ELLIE
D:           I know! And that makes me think

0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           Heyyyy. Look at you, acting all
D:           paranoid like a mini-Maniscalco.
E:               (Ellie laughs)
D:           And normally I’d be with you on this,
D:           but I think you’re just weirded out
D:           ‘cause my dad’s acting all nice.

C:                     ELLIE
D:           Yeah, he’s clearly never used those
D:           muscles before. Like the corners of
D:           his mouth just woke up from a coma.
0: 
C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           So, yes, I do want to run away with
D:           you, but I also kinda want to enjoy
D:           this good mood while it lasts.
0: 
C:                     ELLIE
D:           Okay, that’s fair. Our B&B was
D:           probably haunted anyway.
E:               (then, flirty)
D:           But speaking of good things that
D:           don’t last very long...

C:                     SEBASTIAN
D:           Here? This garage is pretty echo-y
D:           and you know I’m a screamer.

N: Ellie laughs. They start to make out, but as they step back,
N: Ellie accidentally knocks the lids off some trashcans. Behind
N: her, Sebastian squints as he sees what looks like two eyes
N: staring back at him. He looks closer and sees it’s actually:
0: 
N: FUCKING PEACOCK FEATHERS!
0: 
N: ...sticking out from the top of the trash can. His eyes go
N: wide and he starts to panic as he realizes...

D:           I know you can be stubborn, cheap,
D:           obnoxious and severely judgmental.
D:           And for the past year, I’ve been
