M: OCT 14, 2020
S: 1 INT. WARNER HOUSE - AFTERNOON
N: CLOSE ON A TV: JOE MONTANA drives down field in Super Bowl XIX for the San Francisco 49ers. TWO BOYS sit in front of a small TUBE TV. KURT (9), energetic and athletic, is glued to the screen, watching Montana’s every move. His brother, MATT (11), glasses and a natural bookworm, huffs as he watches. Mildly interested. Sports TROPHIES cover the humble walls and shelves. THE GAME ENDS. The 49ers WIN. Kurt fixes his eyes on the screen. On the celebration. On Montana -- and the number on the back on his jersey: #16. Then: DUCT TAPE on the back of an old t-shirt doubling for a jersey. The tape forms the number 13, with the name WARNER above it. Kurt smooths out the shirt, looks it over with a smile, and a dream. Then:
C: KURT
D: MATT!!
S: 2 EXT. WARNER HOUSE - SUNSET
N: A brisk mid-western day. IN THE YARD, Matt lines up as wide receiver. Kurt calls HIKE, then narrates his Super Bowl win.
C: KURT
D: Tie game with two minutes left. Warner drops back. He rolls left. Sees his man. Time running out AND...
N: THROWS. But Matt breaks right instead of left and the ball DROPS in the grass. Kurt throws his hands in the air.
C: KURT
D: What was THAT?? I said left! You had ONE JOB!
E: CONT'D
C: MATT
D: Easy for you to say, this is all you do well.
C: KURT
D: Let’s go again.
E: ignoring him
C: MATT
D: It was fourth down, we lost!
C: KURT
D: No! There was a penalty. Go AGAIN!
N: Matt HUFFS toward the house, done.
C: KURT
D: Where are you going? Get back here and WIN THE SUPER BOWL WITH ME!
E: CONT'D
S: 3 INT. WARNER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Matt sits in front of the TV. Switches the dial to Channel 3 and plays COMBAT on ATARI. THUMP! The football hits the wall outside and the TV goes STATICKY.
C: MATT
D: Kurt, STOP!
N: Another THUMP!
C: MATT
D: You’re messing up the TV!!
E: CONT'D
S: 4 EXT. WARNER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Kurt hurls the ball again. WHAM!
C: MATT
D: STOP!
E: O.S.
N: A beat up Honda Accord sputters into the driveway. Kurt’s mother SUE (30s) climbs out. Weary and tired, she wears a work uniform and carries grocery bags. Kurt runs to her, wrapping his arms around her. It’s obvious how much he loves her.
C: SUE
D: Hey baby. Who won the game?
C: KURT
D: 49ers! Duh. Montana was amazing. 331 yards, 4 touchdowns, he rushed 59 yards -- that’s more than their running back...!
E: rattling on as they walk
S: 5 INT. WARNER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Kurt and Matt clear space on the cluttered table for dinner. Mom pulls TV dinners from the oven with one hand, sifting through PAST DUE bills with the other. Sue sits at the table with the two boys. Kurt holds up a SNEAKER, dirty and worn, a hole in the bottom.
C: KURT
D: Mom, I need new shoes.
C: SUE
D: Sneakers have to last the school year, you know the deal. Put cardboard in em’. No whining. Now bow your heads. Bless this food to the nourishment of our bodies. In the name of the Father, the Son --
E: off his look closes her eyes
N: Kurt’s already taking a bite.
C: SUE
D: Kurtis! -- and the Holy Spirit, amen.
E: CONT'D he puts it back
C: BOYS
D: Amen.
N: Kurt digs in.
C: SUE
D: How was school?
C: MATT
D: Got my report card. Four As. One B. Dad said I get a dollar for ever A!
C: SUE
D: How bout all As next time. Kurtis?
C: KURT
D: Where is dad? He was supposed to be here this weekend.
C: SUE
D: He had to switch. How’s school for you?
N: Kurt hesitates. Matt jumps in.
C: MATT
D: Detention. Again. I had to sit and wait for an hour --
C: KURT
D: No, you didn’t!
C: MATT
D: -- cause you’re slow.
C: KURT
D: Faster than you!
C: MATT
D: I meant stupid!
N: This triggers something in Kurt - he punches Matt in the shoulder and Matt punches him back. Sue grabs them both.
C: SUE
D: BOYS! Enough! Eat your dinner, or so help me GOD!
N: Matt scowls at Kurt. But Kurt just stews. Then he STORMS OUT. Mom shoots Matt a look. Then they hear it - THUMP! Against the side of the house.
S: 6 EXT. WARNER HOME - CONTINUOUS
N: Kurt holds the FOOTBALL. Eyes blurred with tears. Sue walks over beside him.
C: SUE
D: Throw for me?
N: Kurt shakes his head. Drops the ball to the ground.
C: KURT
D: Don’t feel like it.
C: SUE
D: Hey. You don’t get ‘A’s, So what? Neither did I. But you got a shelf full of trophies. All it takes is bein’ great at one thing. This is yours. But talent isn’t enough, Kurtis. You have to work harder than everyone else. Never quit.
E: picks up the football
C: KURT
D: You and Dad did.
C: SUE
D: That’s different. With relationships... But don’t let that stop you. You have a gift, Kurtis.
N: She hands him the football.
C: SUE
D: Maybe some day this ball will define you. Then it won’t matter what people say. Cause you’ll be the best. And no one can argue with that.
E: CONT'D he looks up at her
N: She hands the ball back to him.
C: SUE
D: I gotta get back to work.
E: CONT'D
N: She pats him on the back, then heads to her car. Thirty yards away she stops. Turns back.
C: SUE
D: Hey. Throw it to me.
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: I can’t throw it that far.
C: SUE
D: Won’t know till you try.
N: Kurt winds back, cocks his arms, and throws with everything he’s got. AS THE BALL FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, WE: SMASH TO BLACK: Giant letters scroll across the screen (in homage to ROCKY): A M E R I C A N U N D E R D O G
S: 7 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY
N: A FOOTBALL spirals in perfect SLOW MOTION. Finally CAUGHT by a receiver for a 40 yard gain. The CROWD ERUPTS. University of Northern Iowa. 1993 The UNI Quarterback steps to the line for the next play. BUT it’s not who we expect. Not #13. NOT WARNER. The camera DRIFTS beyond the action to the UNI sidelines... Past front line COACHES and players. Past DEFENSE huddling... FINALLY settles at the distant bench. A player as far from the game as possible. We see his Jersey: WARNER. #13. Benchwarmer. KURT (now 22), square jaw. Perfect archetype of a QB. Except for the not playing part. His leg jackhammers up and down. Impatient. He’s dying to be on the field. Looks to the scoreboard: IT’S LATE IN THE GAME. They’re losing. The UNI QB runs off the field after a three and out, frustrated. Argues with HEAD COACH ALLEN, making excuses. Kurt stands and calls out.
C: KURT
D: Hey Coach! Put me in and I’ll win for you. COACH!
N: Coach Allen trades a glance with him. Then looks the other way and the moment is over.
C: KURT
D: I’m sick of it, Mom. I mean it, I’m done!
E: PRE-LAP CONT'D
S: 8 INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
N: Kurt is the last guy in the locker room. He clutches a PAYPHONE in the corner.
C: SUE
D: No. You stay in the game.
E: O.S.
C: KURT
D: There is no game. That’s the problem. I did everything right to get here and I’ve been sitting on a bench for four years. I can’t get on the field.
C: SUE
D: So find a way. No one said it would be easy. Warners don’t quit.
N: Kurt sighs, frustrated. Leans against the wall in silhouette.
S: 10 INT. KURT AND MIKE HUDNUTT’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
N: A college jock apartment. Beer-stained couches, clothes everywhere, neon Bud Light sign on the wall. ON THE FLOOR, Kurt sits in front of a stack of VCRs strapped to a mini TV. He toggles through GAME FOOTAGE, trying to cut together a reel. Kurt’s roommate emerges from his room in a plaid shirt and cowboy boots. This is MIKE HUDNUTT (22). Six feet, 250 pounds wide, Kurt’s best friend and anchor of the offensive line.
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: Okay. Pick one.
N: Mike holds up two giant belt BUCKLES.
C: KURT
D: Your buckles are like your music, Mike. They’re all the same.
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: How dare you? These tell two very different stories. I’ll take this one. You wear the other.
C: KURT
D: What? No. I have work to do.
N: Kurt turns back to the VCR. Scrolls through: NUMBER 13, in his Panther uniform, dropping back and firing a bullet.
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: That’s not work. Can’t make a highlight reel without highlights, pal. Just sayin.
C: KURT
D: I have highlights.
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: You have one. One highlight. Anyway, who you gonna send it to?
C: KURT
D: Scouts. Agents.
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: You really are delusional. The NFL don’t draft players that never started a college game at a 1AA school in Iowa. Come on - we’re going out.
E: drops one of the buckles in front of Kurt
C: KURT
D: I will never wear that.
N: And...
S: 11 EXT. WILD E. COYOTE BAR - NIGHT
N: A country western bar. Flashing neon sign reads: “WILD E. COYOTE”. Underneath it hangs a “LADIES NIGHT” banner. Mike’s Monster truck pulls into the parking lot, country music BLASTING from the stereo. In the passenger seat, Kurt SIGHS.
C: KURT
D: Turn it OFF. You’re killing me, man.
S: 12 INT. WILD E. COYOTE BAR - NIGHT
N: Kurt steps into the smokey dive bar. He cringes, eyeing the giant DANCE FLOOR where dozens of cowgirls and cowboys are smack in the middle of a LINE DANCE. Kurt shakes his head, instantly miserable. Mike slaps him on the back...
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: It’s gonna be a fun night!
N: And heads off to greet his friends, leaving Kurt by himself. Looking very out of place in a t-shirt, jeans and sneakers. As Mike stomps into the dancing crowd, Kurt heads straight for the bar. Within seconds, every BLONDE seems to be eyeing him. But Kurt can’t be bothered. LATER, the dancing continues, but Kurt hasn’t budged. He just sips his beer, ignoring the women circling him. Then he looks to the DANCE FLOOR and his gaze lands on: ONE GIRL. In the middle of the action. Short skirt, cowboy boots and spikey dark hair. She’s brash and badass and funny all at the same time. This is BRENDA MEONI (25). Brenda dances with a HELL’S ANGEL three times her age, then spins away and joins a skinny rodeo guy, then moves on again, from guy to guy, but not flirting -- it’s all about the dancing. And SHE’S GREAT AT IT. She lights everyone up around her, and Kurt is immediately captivated. He steps closer, watching her. Then Brenda turns his way and THEIR EYES MEET... And for just a split-second... EVERYTHING SEEMS TO STOP. The room goes quiet. Kurt is locked in. Doesn’t even blink. Brenda meets his gaze, curious. Kurt takes a step toward her on the DANCE FLOOR when:
C: BARTENDER
D: All right y’all, line up, it’s a BARN DANCE!
E: O.S
N: Everyone scrambles, guys in one line facing girls in another. Hudnutt included. And Brenda still right in the middle of it all. Kurt retreats, back to the bar. Total fish out of water. But he keep his eye locked on Brenda. Who is this girl??
S: 13 EXT. NORTHERN IOWA STADIUM - DAY
N: MID-PRACTICE. Kurt drops back in the pocket. He looks up to see the DEFENSE RUSHING HIM. And he panics. Kurt SCRAMBLES BACK.
C: COACH ALLEN
D: Stay in the pocket, Warner!
N: Kurt dodges to the sideline, but still makes a stellar throw. Caught 25 yards downfield. Kurt looks to the coach. Not impressed.
C: KURT
D: You promised me. You promised if I waited my turn I’d play.
E: PRE-LAP
N: AFTER PRACTICE, Kurt faces off with the Coach. Frustrated.
C: COACH ALLEN
D: My promise to this university is to put the best out on the field.
C: KURT
D: If the best were on the field we’d be winning! I can win for you, it’s what I’ve been doing my whole life!
C: COACH ALLEN
D: You know what your problem is, Warner? Want me to sum it up for you? Why you’re such a tragedy? You don’t stay in the pocket.
C: KURT
D: What??
C: COACH ALLEN
D: You have the talent, loads of it. But when things get hard, you bail. You run from adversity. You don’t trust your team or my playbook. Staying in the pocket means standing your ground and taking the hit, no matter how much it hurts. That’s what leaders do. And you’re not a leader.
E: as Kurt tries to object
C: KURT
D: That’s not true! Give me a shot to prove myself. Let me start one game.
C: COACH ALLEN
D: Practice is where you prove yourself. You don’t deserve to play in the game.
N: Coach walks away. Kurt chase after.
C: KURT
D: Coach, wait! Ten more games and my dream is gone. I’ve been working my whole life for this. PLEASE.
C: COACH ALLEN
D: You need to start thinking about life after football, son.
N: Kurt steps in front of him, defiant.
C: KURT
D: No. I WILL NOT QUIT, sir. Just TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO DO.
N: Coach studies Kurt. This kid. But there IS a fire in him. THEN:
S: 14 EXT. FOOTBALL PRACTICE FIELD - DAY
N: WHAM! Kurt gets SLAMMED hard by a MASSIVE DEFENSIVE END. He hits the ground. Looks to the coach in confusion.
C: COACH ALLEN
D: Again!
N: Kurt shakes it off and lines up for a snap. Hike! Drops back in the pocket and WHAM!!! Taken down again.
C: KURT
D: How many times we gonna do this, Coach? Just... wanna pace myself.
C: COACH ALLEN
D: As many as I say. You take the hit. No matter what comes at you. You can throw, but you cannot leave the pocket. You want your shot, you take the pain.
N: MOMENTS LATER... WHAM!! Another BRUTAL hit. NEXT ONE - Kurt gets off a haphazard throw, but still gets drilled to the ground.
C: COACH ALLEN
D: Who else wants to kill Kurt?
E: CONT'D
N: Hands go up everywhere, including HUDNUTT.
C: KURT
D: You’re on offense, Mike.
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: I’ll switch for this!
N: And... BAM! Kurt goes down again.
C: COACH ALLEN
D: Can you take it? Or you gonna quit?
N: He wills himself off the ground.
C: KURT
D: Just getting warmed up, Coach.
S: 15 EXT. HY-VEE SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - LATER
N: Mike and Kurt push their cart from the market, loaded up on chips and donuts. Mike already chows down on a bag of Nachos. Kurt limps along, sore, leaning on the cart. They pass a STOCK BOY, hard at work unpacking a pallet. Mike nudges Kurt.
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: Could be worse, right?
N: He slaps Kurt on the back. Kurt winces. Glancing one more time at the stock boy. As they approach Mike’s truck:
C: KURT
D: Hudd, I need a favor. You’re gonna laugh.
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: Can’t wait to hear this.
N: Kurt stops and turns.
C: KURT
D: Teach me to dance.
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: Dance?? Like... LINE dance?
C: KURT
D: No. Like that... you know, the Barn Dance. For instance.
N: And sure enough, Mike LAUGHS. Loud. Milking it. Finally... MOMENTS LATER The groceries are in the flatbed but the stereo is BLASTING Tim McGraw. Mike leads Kurt through the Barn Dance moves. Mike is still laughing. The stock boy watches them, like “What in the literal hell?”
S: 16 INT. WILD E. COYOTE BAR - NIGHT
N: Kurt still wears his normal jeans and t-shirt, but this time he’s sporting one of Mike’s giant belt buckles. Mike GRINS.
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: You know how happy this makes me?
N: Kurt ignores him, scanning the crowd for Brenda. He steps up to the bar, nods to the bartender, who’s also the DJ.
C: KURT
D: You guys have daiquiris?
N: The bartender looks at him, deadpan. Kurt glances behind the bar to a pin up CALENDAR and he does a double take. It’s Brenda. On the calendar. In a bright red shirt, jean shorts and big boots - “Miss August”. Then he hears her voice and turns... THERE SHE IS. On the dance floor, as always. Brenda spots him, too. As if she was hoping.
C: KURT
D: Hold up, forget the drink!
E: CONT'D to bartender MORE
C: KURT
D: Can you play one of those line dances... No, wait, Barn Dance. Please.
E: CONT'D
N: He drops a five on the bar. The bartender glances at Brenda. He gets it.
C: BARTENDER
D: Aright! Barn dance, everyone!
E: O.S.
N: A SONG STARTS and Brenda jumps into position. Kurt quickly steps over, joins the line of men, facing off with the women. He does his best to keep up, using the moves Mike taught him, but his attention is mainly on getting to Brenda. Kurt cheats a few times, skipping the girl he’s supposed to do-si-do with, messing up the dance a bit, until finally -- He is FACE to FACE with her. Brenda raises an eyebrow.
C: BRENDA
D: About time.
N: He smiles. So does she. Kurt takes her by the hand and they dance. He struggles to do the steps properly, while she is smooth as silk.
C: BRENDA
D: You don’t look like a cowboy.
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: Cause I’m not.
C: BRENDA
D: So what are you, then?
C: KURT
D: Football player.
C: BRENDA
D: Do you have a name?
C: KURT
D: Kurt... Warner. And you are?
N: She looks into his eyes. Hmm.
C: BRENDA
D: Nope. Not yet.
N: Kurt is getting better. It comes time for the partners to switch but he just spins past another girl and lands back in front of Brenda. Over the music:
C: BRENDA
D: Supposed to switch.
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: But I haven’t gotten your name yet.
N: He causes another traffic jam. She just smiles and keeps dancing. LATER. AT THE BAR. Brenda drinks a dark lager. Kurt nurses a daiquiri, complete with an umbrella. Brenda eyes it, judging.
C: KURT
D: What?? I like what I like.
E: CONT'D
N: She nods. Okay.
C: BRENDA
D: So... football. Tell me about that.
C: KURT
D: How do you mean? What do you want to know?
C: BRENDA
D: Well, you described yourself as a sport. Must be pretty important to you. Why?
C: KURT
D: How about this, I’ll answer your question if you answer mine.... Miss August?
N: He motions to the calendar. She laughs and nearly spits her beer.
C: BRENDA
D: That’s ah... Well... it’s a “Hot Pants” competition. First Thursday of every month. First time I won so... God, this is embarrassing. So football. Give me an honest answer and I’ll give you my name.
E: A look. A moment. Then...
N: Kurt nods. Deal.
C: KURT
D: Ok, so. Football is the first thing my Dad ever taught me, before... Before he left. It helped me through a lot of hard times...
E: beat MORE
C: KURT
D: You know. Single mom. Always struggling, never had enough. And I wanted.... more. To make something of myself. And football was all I was ever good at. As long as I had a ball in my hand, I felt like everything was gonna be alright. I felt... alive. I guess. Kinda like right now. So it’s more than a game for me. It’s a chance to be proven worthy. Honest enough for ya?
E: CONT'D she grins beat
C: BRENDA
D: It’s a start... Come on, more dancing!
E: then
N: She grabs his hand and pulls him back to the DANCE FLOOR. MOMENTS LATER they’re LINE DANCING this time. Except Kurt is facing the wrong way. Backwards. Looking right at Brenda. He’s confident now, doesn’t care about the moves.
C: BRENDA
D: Turn around!
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: I like this view better. She won’t tell me her name.
E: to everyone
N: He’s being a ham, and everyone buys in. Except Brenda, who rolls her eyes. She steps forward and turns Kurt back around to face the right way. AND NOW IT’S MIDNIGHT. They’re slow dancing. And Kurt is very happy about it. The place has mostly cleared out. The night belongs to them. A slower song begins -- ‘Fishin’ in the Dark’ by Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Brenda perks up.
C: KURT
D: Okay. This one I actually like. And I hate country music.
E: CONT'D
C: BRENDA
D: Oh yeah? Well, I hate sports, so... guess it’ll never work between us.
C: KURT
D: Guess not.
N: Kurt pulls her even closer. Brenda rests her head on his shoulder.
C: BRENDA
D: Why do you like this song?
C: KURT
D: Cause it’s different. Like you.
N: Brenda smiles, then lifts her head to look Kurt in the eye. It’s electric. Finally...
C: BRENDA
D: I’m Brenda.
C: KURT
D: Good to meet you, Brenda.
N: Brenda leans closer into him. They almost kiss, THEN -- the house lights start blinking.
C: BRENDA
D: And I gotta go.
N: She pulls away and heads straight for the back entrance.
C: KURT
D: Wait!
S: 17 EXT. WILD E. COYOTE BAR - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
N: Kurt catches up to Brenda as she opens the door to her rusty, 1979 Buick Regal. Two car seats in the back.
C: KURT
D: Can I at least have your number?
C: BRENDA
D: Trust me. You don’t want it.
C: KURT
D: Why not?
C: BRENDA
D: Look, there’s a few things you need to know about me. I’m divorced... and I got two kids.
N: She looks up at him. Honest.
C: BRENDA
D: So if I never see you again, I totally understand.
E: CONT'D
N: She slides behind the wheel, starts her car and drives off. Kurt stands, speechless, unsure what just hit him. IN THE CAR - Brenda checks her REAR VIEW, sees Kurt still standing there, fading off the distance. Fights the urge to turn the car around.
S: 18 INT. BRENDA’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT
N: Brenda enters, still in a daze. Her mom, JENNY JO (50’s), sits in a recliner, baby JESSE (1) asleep on her shoulder.
C: JENNY JO
D: So? Was ‘the guy’ there?
C: BRENDA
D: He was, actually.
C: JENNY JO
D: And...?
N: Mom leans in, really wants the scoop. But Brenda just shrugs.
C: BRENDA
D: What’s the point, Mom?
S: 19 INT. KID’S ROOM - NIGHT
N: A small room, squeezed with two twin beds and a crib. Brenda lays the baby down, then kicks off her boots, exhausted. Brenda snuggles next to ZACK (4) in a bed too small for the two of them. Zack feels for her hand, pulls it right over his heart. He whispers.
C: ZACK
D: Sing the song?
C: BRENDA
D: There came three gypsies to my door, Inquiring after my lady oh, One sang high and the other sang low, And the third sang...
E: singing
C: ZACK AND BRENDA
D: Bonnie bonnie biscay oh...
S: 21 INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - MORNING
N: Morning rush. Brenda gets the kids ready. She wears an old robe, no makeup, hair a mess. BABY JESSE CRIES at the table. Refuses to eat apple sauce.
C: BRENDA
D: Eat your food and you can get down.
N: Jesse unleashed more FURY. Zack rounds the corner, hand touching the wall for guidance. It’s obvious he’s disabled, possibly blind, but it doesn’t slow him down. He holds an old radio in his hand.
C: BRENDA
D: Over here, baby.
E: CONT'D
N: Zack hands her the radio. Swaying back and forth.
C: BRENDA
D: Is it broken?
E: CONT'D
C: ZACK
D: Broken, Mama.
C: BRENDA
D: I can’t fix it right now. I gotta feed Jesse.
N: WHAM. Apple sauce sprays all over Brenda’s robe and hair.
C: BRENDA
D: Jesse! NO! No.
E: CONT'D
N: Jesse LAUGHS now. More sauce on the walls. THEN: A KNOCK on the sliding glass door, covered by vertical blinds. Brenda looks up. Totally confused.
C: BRENDA
D: Mom? Dad? Just a minute!
E: CONT'D
N: She twists the blinds open to reveal... KURT. Smiling. Holding a single ROSE. Brenda’s eyes go wide. What the hell??
C: BRENDA
D: Wha... Hi. Can you just. Ah...
E: CONT'D
N: Then she realizes what she’s wearing. She brushes her hand through her hair. Feeling the apple sauce.
C: BRENDA
D: Just... Give me a minute.
E: CONT'D
N: She CLOSES the blinds before he can say anything. OUTSIDE, Kurt waits. He looks around. Fiddles with the rose. Starting to feel pretty stupid.
C: KURT
D: Is this a bad time? I can come back if... This was such a bad idea.
E: to himself
N: Finally the blinds twist open. Kurt smiles, but NO ONE is there. Then the door unlocks and slides open. Kurt looks down to see... ZACK. Still holding the radio. He reaches out and touches Kurt’s jeans. His version of seeing.
C: KURT
D: Hi. Where did your mom go?
E: CONT'D
N: Zack smiles. Takes him by the big finger and pulls him into the house.
C: ZACK
D: Come on.
S: 22 INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Zack leads Kurt down the hallway. Kurt looks to the mess at the kitchen table. Apple sauce still drips down the walls. But Brenda is nowhere to be found. ON THE MANTLE, Kurt notices PHOTOS of Brenda in full MARINE UNIFORM. Zack walks to the door of the bedroom, points to a radio that sits beside the bed. It PLAYS COUNTRY MUSIC softly. Zack walks over and taps the working radio. Kurt peers in at the unmade beds, crammed next to each other. Then Zack pulls him into the... BATHROOM. Where he sets the radio on the counter. Mashing its buttons.
C: ZACK
D: Broken.
C: KURT
D: The radio?
N: Zack nods. Kurt looks it over. Spots a power cable dangling nearby. He plugs the radio in. Adjusts the antenna. STATIC. Zack smiles. Turning the dial. Finding the same COUNTRY station. Kurt cringes at his choice of music.
C: KURT
D: Country, really? They got to you, too?
E: CONT'D
N: Zack nods. Then lays on the floor, on his back.
C: ZACK
D: I like it.
N: Kurt looks toward the hallway. Where is Brenda? Then he shrugs and lays down beside Zack.
C: KURT
D: I’m Kurt.
C: ZACK
D: I’m Zack. I wanna be a black truck driver.
E: a beat
C: KURT
D: A what??
N: Suddenly Brenda’s mom steps into the doorway, interrupting.
C: JENNY JO
D: Ah... What he means is he wants to drive a black truck. Not the... other way around.
N: Kurt looks up at her from the floor. Strange moment.
C: KURT
D: Hi. I’m here for Brenda.
E: awkward
C: JENNY JO
D: I figured. Otherwise I’d be, you know, calling the police.
C: KURT
D: Right. I’m Kurt.
E: chuckles
N: He starts to get up but Zack grabs his arm. Keeping him on the floor.
C: JENNY JO
D: Ok, then. I’m Jenny Jo. The mom.
N: IN THE HALLWAY, Brenda emerges, looking somewhat presentable, holding Jesse. She makes eye contact with her mom, like “go away!” As they switch places, Jenny Jo takes Jess. Whispers.
C: JENNY JO
D: Is that “the guy”? He’s cute!
E: CONT'D
N: Brenda shoos her away, then hovers by the bathroom door. Peeks in, listening as Kurt and Zack talk.
C: KURT
D: I’m gonna play in the NFL one day.
C: ZACK
D: What’s that?
C: KURT
D: The National Football League.
C: ZACK
D: What’s that?
C: KURT
D: It’s a game. That I love to play. And if you’re good enough, you can play in the NFL.
C: ZACK
D: Are you good enough?
C: KURT
D: Yeah. Just need a chance.
C: ZACK
D: I need a chance.
C: KURT
D: To what?
C: ZACK
D: Drive my truck. We could drive to your game.
N: They start to get up. Brenda jolt, makes for the kitchen. Kurt emerges with Zack tugging on his hand. Brenda pretends she wasn’t eavesdropping.
C: KURT
D: Fixed the radio.
C: BRENDA
D: Oh, thanks. We have one in every room. It helps Zack--
E: MORE
C: BRENDA
D: Ok, can I just be blunt?
E: CONT'D shakes her head, anyway
C: KURT
D: Why stop now?
C: BRENDA
D: How do you know where I live?
C: KURT
D: Oh. Friend from the bar.
C: BRENDA
D: And... WHY are you here?
C: KURT
D: I wanted to meet your kids. Oh and....
N: He holds up the rose. She takes it. Perplexed and intrigued. Zack still holds Kurt’s hand, swaying back and forth.
C: ZACK
D: Come on, Mark.
N: Kurt frowns, looks to Brenda. Mark??
C: BRENDA
D: Ex-boyfriend. Don’t ask. Listen, I can’t really -- I gotta get Zack to physical therapy... I should go.
E: shrugs
C: KURT
D: Physical therapy?
C: BRENDA
D: Yeah he’s... He’s legally blind and is... well, on his own journey.
E: looks at him like “can’t you tell?”
C: KURT
D: Oh. Didn’t notice.
N: For some reason, that blows her away.
C: BRENDA
D: But he’s gonna show the world what he can do.
C: KURT
D: I believe it. Well... I’ll let you go.
N: He heads for the door. Zack holds Brenda’s hand, too and Kurt gets far enough away where he has to let go. It’s a moment.
S: 23 EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - DAY
N: Kurt steps outside. Brenda joins him. She hands him a napkin. On it --
C: BRENDA
D: My number. So maybe call first next time. Where’s your car?
C: KURT
D: Oh. I walked.
C: BRENDA
D: From UNI? That’s like three miles.
C: KURT
D: Yeah. Worth it!
N: He smiles, holding up the napkin. Then turns and walks away. She watches him go. Mind spinning.
S: 24 EXT. UNI STADIUM - DAY
N: WHAM! Kurt goes down in another “Kill Kurt” drill. But this time he gets off a beautiful pass before being CRUSHED. He hops up, clapping. YES!
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: Why you grinnin’ like an idiot?
C: KURT
D: Let’s do it again. Come on guys! Again!
N: Other players step up. Coach Allen watches from a distance.
S: 25 EXT. UNI STADIUM - GAME DAY
N: GAME TIME. The opposition prepares to PUNT. ON THE SIDELINES, Kurt is in his familiar spot, keeping the bench warm. He eyes the Coach, watching him argue with the STARTING QB. Suddenly, in frustration, Coach calls out:
C: COACH ALLEN
D: Warner! Next series is yours.
N: The other QB huffs away. Kurt double-takes.
C: KURT
D: Me?!
C: COACH ALLEN
D: Any other Warners out here?
C: KURT
D: No. Yeah..... Great!
N: Kurt hops up, heads for the sideline. Coach stops him.
C: COACH
D: You’ll need that.
N: Points to Kurt’s helmet. Still on the bench. Kurt grabs it. FIRST DOWN. Kurt takes the hike. Drops back, surveys. The pocket collapses and he gets SACKED. He gets up and looks at Coach. SECOND DOWN. Kurt HANDS OFF. The D LINE suffocates the tailback for a loss. THIRD DOWN. Kurt drops back, surveys coverage. NOTHING. And here they come. The pocket collapses -- AND KURT RETREATS. He darts left towards the sideline. Looking across the field as he goes... JUST BEFORE he runs out of bounds he leaps and throws across his body to the OTHER SIDE of the field. Fifty yards later a WIDE RECIEVER catches it for a TOUCHDOWN. A PERFECT and IMPOSSIBLE throw. The crowd goes WILD. The STARTING QB is NOT happy. But the other players gape. Even Coach raises an eyebrow. Kurt BASKS in the moment.
C: KURT
D: What I tell you, Coach?
C: COACH ALLEN
D: Still didn’t stay in the damn pocket.
C: KURT
D: Got it done, though, didn’t I?
S: 26 EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Brenda sits on the couch in a rare moment of peace and quiet. She looks out the window to her father LARRY (60s), a large blue collar man, mowing the grass. Zack rides on his shoulders, loving every minute of it. The phone RINGS. Brenda pulls it over by the cord. Answers.
C: BRENDA
D: Hello?
C: KURT
D: Hey there. I’m starting! Next week! It’s Kurt by the way. Warner.
E: V.O.
N: KURT IN HIS APARTMENT. CROSS CUT.
C: KURT
D: You get my messages?
C: BRENDA
D: Yeah. All of them.
C: KURT
D: See, I called first. Good, right?
C: BRENDA
D: Very impressed.
C: KURT
D: I wanted to tell you, we won this weekend. 27, 12. I had fourteen completions, 300 yards.
C: BRENDA
D: Wow. That’s a lot of numbers.
C: KURT
D: Good numbers. So let’s celebrate. Monday night. On a... date?
C: BRENDA
D: Yeah, what are we gonna do, walk?
C: KURT
D: Is that a yes? Sounds like a yes. Hello?
N: Brenda hangs up, smirking.
S: 30 INT. KURT AND MIKE HUDNUTT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Kurt labels a folder “Project NFL.” Stuffed with research on teams, contacts, etc. Then pins a “DAYS TO THE DRAFT” calendar on the wall. Marking a day off. Eyeing the DAY OF DESTINY, months away. He calls out --
C: KURT
D: Hey Hud... I need a favor!
S: 27 EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - AFTERNOON
N: Kurt pulls up to Brenda’s driveway in Hudnutt’s monster truck. He HONKS and waits. Brenda steps out, confused.
C: BRENDA
D: What are you doing?
C: KURT
D: Got us a ride!
C: BRENDA
D: Kurt, I can’t. I have the kids.
C: KURT
D: You’re gonna make this really difficult, aren’t you.
S: 28 EXT. DRIVE-IN - DUSK
N: The truck is parked backwards with the bed open towards the giant screen. Zack is in the drivers seat, pretending to drive the truck. ‘The Sandlot’ plays loud over the stereo. Kurt and Brenda sit in the back. Legs dangling from the truck bed. Jesse is asleep beside them on a pile of blankets.
C: KURT
D: So, you were a Marine? I saw the pictures.
E: off her look
N: She nods, a little guarded.
C: BRENDA
D: That feels like another life... That I don’t really wanna talk about.
N: Kurt just nods. Silent. Comfortable.
C: BRENDA
D: It’s.... kinda like a country song, you know? Starts out great, then everything goes to hell.
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: Well, you know I love country music. Come on...
N: He gives her a look. A nod. A challenge. She meets his gaze. Sighs.
C: BRENDA
D: Where do I even start... When I was maybe twelve, after church this woman walks up to me and says, “there’s something really special about you, Brenda. God is gonna do something great with you.” And I... had the audacity to believe her. So I had this dream of becoming a Marine and marrying a Marine and having little Marine children. God and country all the way. So I signed up. Right outa high school.
E: finding her way
C: KURT
D: What’d your parents think of that?
C: BRENDA
D: We... had some discussions. I won. Always do. Shipped off to Boot camp, defined myself. And then.... I met Neil. Perfect Marine. We were the perfect couple. Whirlwind romance. Marriage. I’m 20 years old at the time. Zack was born a year later. Why am I telling you this?
E: wants to stop
C: KURT
D: Because you trust me.
C: BRENDA
D: Do I?
N: Kurt grins.
C: KURT
D: So... was Zack born blind?
N: Brenda hesitates, self-conscious again. Clearly not used to opening up. And not quite sure why she’s doing it now. But --
C: BRENDA
D: No... he wasn’t. Neil ah... dropped him when he was four months old. We rushed to the hospital, where we were told he suffered a traumatic brain injury and would be lucky to survive the night. It was an accident. Just one of those things. And I wasn’t even there. You know how helpless that feels?
E: with difficulty
N: Kurt just sits silent. Listening intently. Brenda goes off into a thousand yard stare.
C: BRENDA
D: I remember praying and praying and begging God in that hospital to save my baby boy. And he did. Doctors said his brain was like Swiss cheese. First of all, who says that? Who tells a mother that?? They said he would never walk, and yet... That he would never talk, and now I can’t get him to stop.
E: CONT'D she smiles
N: Kurt nods to Zack in the driver’s seat.
C: KURT
D: That he would never be a black truck driver?
N: Brenda LAUGHS.
C: BRENDA
D: He always finds a way to prove everyone wrong. And he’s the love of my life. Then, from bad to worse, when I was eight months pregnant with this one, Neil decided to cheat on me. So... yeah. I have trust issues. I’ve been hurt. You gonna hurt me, Kurt Warner? Told you my life’s a country song.
E: gathers they share a gaze
C: KURT
D: I’m sorry.
C: BRENDA
D: Don’t be... Look what it got me. Sometimes beauty comes from ashes.
E: looks to Jesse and Zack
C: KURT
D: So... you still believe her? That church lady?
N: Brenda shrugs, bittersweet. Honest.
C: BRENDA
D: I’m tryin’.
S: 29 EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Kurt parks the truck. Walks Brenda to the house. Jesse asleep in one of his arms, holding Zack’s hand with the other. Brenda can’t help but notice. ON THE PORCH, Brenda’s parents wait for them. Larry wears a factory uniform, all blue collar grit. Jenny Jo smiles.
C: JENNY JO
D: Well, hey there!
C: BRENDA
D: Hi. Kurt, this is my dad.
C: KURT
D: Hello, sir.
N: As Larry nods, Zack runs to him.
C: ZACK
D: Papa!
N: Brenda’s older sister KIM pops her head out. Admiring Kurt.
C: KIM
D: Well hi there.
C: BRENDA
D: Alright, back off. That’s my sister.
C: KIM
D: Don’t worry, I’m married.
E: to Kurt
N: Kurt smirks. Brenda swats everyone away.
C: BRENDA
D: Go! All of you.
N: Mom takes Jesse and they go inside, leaving Brenda and Kurt alone. Kurt steps close. Brenda goes a bit quiet.
C: BRENDA
D: So... I’m trying to imagine a scenario where any of this works.
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: What exactly?
C: BRENDA
D: You know? Us.
C: KURT
D: We’re an ‘Us’? Great news!
E: grinning
N: Brenda rolls her eyes.
C: BRENDA
D: You’re a jock. I hate jocks. And you’re in college, Kurt, and I’m.... not. And I’ve got two kids and -- This is crazy. It’s... not gonna work.
E: gazes at him
C: KURT
D: You keep saying that.
C: BRENDA
D: I just don’t want... I can’t... We should just...
N: And suddenly she KISSES HIM. Kurt is caught off guard for a beat. Then he wraps his arms around her and kisses her back. A long, potent kiss. Finally they pull away. Brenda catches her breath. Then:
C: KURT
D: So. Tomorrow night?
C: BRENDA
D: Yeah.
S: 31 EXT. STADIUM - DAY
N: Packed crowd. TONS OF ENERGY. Students, cheerleaders, fans. ON THE FIELD. Kurt steps to the LINE in slow mo. Loving it. Ball in hand. He surveys. Takes a breath. HIKE!
S: 32 INT. WILD E. COYOTE BAR - NIGHT
N: The bar is packed. Everyone’s eyes on the TV, watching the game. Where Kurt is dominating. Brenda sits at the bar. Glued to the screen.

E: O.S.
N: ON THE TV: Kurt drops back. Let’s it fly. TOUCHDOWN! The bar erupts. Brenda CHEERS. OFF THIS --
S: 33 INT. KURT AND MIKE HUDNUTT'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: ...NOW THE FOOTAGE PLAYS ON KURT’S TV. As he cuts together a new DEMO REEL. He ejects the tape. Labels it. Then looks to his DRAFT calendar. “DAY OF DESTINY” is just two months away.
S: INT. KURT AND MIKE HUDNUTT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Kurt holds the phone to his ear. Talking to a sports agent, RICH. Brenda and Hudnutt listen.
C: KURT
D: A few agents looked at me. Towards the end of the season. And I hit up Pro-Day at a couple other schools. We’re... too small to have one.
E: into phone
N: Brenda leans into the phone. Her face close to his. He kisses her quick. Mike snaps his finger and points, like “FOCUS!”.
C: RICH
D: Six two, two twenty. Didn’t start till Year 5.... Why?
E: O.S.
C: KURT
D: Ah... Late bloomer? But I was Gateway player of the year. And our team was first in conference.
C: RICH
D: Didn’t seem to help your team in the playoffs. Look, it’s rare that a 1AA player gets drafted...
E: O.S. beat
N: Kurt and Brenda hold their breath. Waiting. Now Mike leans in, too.
C: RICH
D: But let’s see what we can do.
E: O.S. CONT'D
C: KURT
D: Great! Thank you. I--
C: RICH
D: Gotta grab this. Look forward to it.
E: O.S.
N: CLICK. Kurt looks to Brenda and Mike, in shock.

D: I GOT AN AGENT!
N: He PUMPS his fist and they all SCREAM.
S: 36 EXT. KURT’S MOM’S HOME - CEDAR RAPIDS - DAY
N: Kurt pulls up to his childhood home in Hudnutt’s black truck. Mom greets him on the porch, excited. Quick hug.
C: SUE
D: Draft day!
S: 37 INT. KURT'S MOM'S HOME - CEDAR RAPIDS - DAY
N: ESPN coverage plays on TV. Mom puts out a bowl of chips.
C: KURT
D: Good thing you have cable, or I wouldn’t even know if I got picked.
C: SUE
D: Feeling confident?
C: KURT
D: Feeling nervous.
N: LATER. Kurt paces, on the phone with his Dad.
C: GENE
D: ...Heck yeah, I’m watching. Wouldn’t miss it.
E: ON PHONE
C: KURT
D: Thanks, Dad. Hey, I better go, it’s about to start.
N: There’s a KNOCK at the door. Sue opens it to find -- BRENDA AND ZACK. Kurt jolts, surprised. Zack barrels to him. Sue watches this little disabled boy run into her house, then she nods at Brenda. A bit cold.
C: KURT
D: Hey, babe. Mom, this is Brenda. And Zack.
E: CONT'D shifts
C: BRENDA
D: Surprise. Thought you might like some extra support.
C: SUE
D: Hello, there.
C: BRENDA
D: Hi! Great to meet you. Kurt’s told me all about you.
C: SUE
D: How nice. He hasn’t said much about you.
N: Kurt cringes a little. Instant tension. THEY SETTLE ON THE COUCH as the draft starts. Zack walks right up to the TV, squints with his good eye.
C: KURT
D: Sit with me, Z-man. This is where they pick the people who get to play football.
C: ZACK
D: Pick Kurt. Pick KURT!
C: BRENDA
D: Quiet down, Zack.
E: whispering
N: Kurt looks from Brenda to his mom. Sue’s disapproval is obvious. And here’s Kurt, literally stuck in the middle. ON THE TV - music and graphic play. Everyone HUSHES. Zack plops into Kurt’s lap. He can’t see the screen, he’s just excited to be part of it. Then PAUL TAGLIABUE, COMMISSIONER OF THE NFL, begins:
C: TAGLIABUE
D: For the first pick of the 1994 draft, the Cincinnati Bengals have picked -- Dan Wilkinson, defensive tackle.
E: ON SCREEN
C: ZACK
D: Pick KURT!!
N: Brenda SHUSHES him again.
C: KURT
D: Ok, it’s okay. I probably won’t be called before tomorrow.
C: BRENDA
D: Tomorrow?
C: KURT
D: Yeah. There’s seven rounds of picks, spread over two days. If... when... I’m picked it’ll be the later rounds.
C: BRENDA
D: Oh. Tomorrow is Zack’s birthday. We’re having a party. At the house. Remember?
N: Kurt waves it off.
C: KURT
D: Right. Yeah, that’s fine. You start the party. I’ll stop by as soon as this is over. We can celebrate everything together.
E: grins optimistically
S: 38 INT. KURT'S MOM'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: LATER. Sue does dishes, watching through the window as Kurt helps Brenda load Zack into her old Buick Regal. MOMENTS LATER, Kurt enters the kitchen. Sue glances at him.
C: SUE
D: Sure that’s a good idea?
C: KURT
D: What?
C: SUE
D: Single mom, two kids, it’s no joke.
C: I would know.
D: That’s the life you really want?
E: beat
N: She hands him a plate to dry. On Kurt... hesitating.
S: 37 INT. KURT'S MOM'S HOME - CEDAR RAPIDS - DAY
N: THE NEXT DAY, Kurt sits alone. Glued to the TV. As... ON THE SCREEN: They announce the LAST pick of the draft. Not Kurt Warner. ON HIS FACE, as it sets it.
S: 39 INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - EVENING
N: Zack’s birthday party. It’s a small affair. Just Brenda and her parents, Kim and JOHN (Kim’s husband), little Jesse, and a few of Zack’s preschool friends. Kurt enters, clearly late. Brenda looks to him. Wondering... Kurt shakes his head. Brenda slumps sympathetically.
C: KURT
D: Sorry I’m so late. I just had to watch to the end.
N: She tries to hug him. But he shrugs it off. It stings, but Brenda pivots to Zack.
C: BRENDA
D: He’s been asking about you. Didn’t want to do the cake until you’re here.
N: Zack runs over. Kurt perks up for him.
C: KURT
D: Happy birthday, Z-man!
C: ZACK
D: Want cake?!
C: KURT
D: Of course I do.
N: LATER. Everyone chats, Larry runs Zack around the house on his shoulders. Kurt sits off on his own, poking at a piece of cake. Dejected. Brenda approaches.
C: BRENDA
D: You okay?
N: But he’s off in his own world.
C: KURT
D: Fine. Think I’m gonna head out.
N: And he walks out. Brenda watches him go, disappointed. Then thinks better of it and follows.
S: 40 EXT. BRENDA’S PARENTS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: She chases Kurt into the driveway.
C: BRENDA
D: Yeah? Just like that? Just gonna run off?
C: KURT
D: What do you want me to say, Brenda?
C: BRENDA
D: You know. Dreams don’t always look like you think they will.
C: KURT
D: Yeah. Well looks like mine is over. So.
C: BRENDA
D: Stop it. Hey. You know the motto of the Marines?
N: Kurt turns.
C: KURT
D: What?
C: BRENDA
D: Semper Fidelis. It means “always faithful”. It means never give up. Never quit. So if this is your dream, what do you need to do, Kurt Warner?
N: Kurt looks at her, surprised. But it’s working, she’s getting through. Brenda continues, firm.
C: BRENDA
D: Cause I don’t think you’re gonna let this stop you. Just because it’s hard. That’s not the man that
E: CONT'D
C: I....
D: ...that I’m....into. A little.
E: beat
N: ON KURT. Deciding.
S: 41 INT. BRENDA’S BUICK REGAL - DAY
N: Brenda drives. Kurt’s next to her, in his UNI sweats. Upbeat. Revving himself up.
C: KURT
D: It’s gonna be ok. Gonna be great. GREAT. I’m a free agent now. Teams are still filling out their rosters, I could still get a call.
C: BRENDA
D: Great. So you keep working out, don’t let this slow you down.
C: KURT
D: Exactly... Hey, left! Gym's over there! Turn left.
C: BRENDA
D: Can’t do that.
N: She TURNS RIGHT.
C: KURT
D: What?
C: BRENDA
D: Car won’t turn left. I’m serious. It just dies.
C: KURT
D: But the gym’s that way.
C: BRENDA
D: Listen fella, if you turn right, and right, and right again, you can get just about anywhere. Sometimes you just gotta find another way.
E: grinning
S: 42 INT. CEDAR FALLS DINER - NIGHT
N: Kurt tears into one of THREE CHEESEBURGERS on his plate. Slurps a chocolate shake. NFL Folder open before him. He’s buried in STATS of various NFL franchises. Brenda just smirks. Admiring him.
C: KURT
D: What?
C: BRENDA
D: You’re cute when you’re focused.
N: Then A VOICE interrupts:
C: VOICE
D: Kurt Warner! I have been looking everywhere for YOU.
E: O.C.
N: It’s a wondrous cross between a used car salesman and a revival tent preacher. Kurt and Brenda spin on their stools to face:
C: JIM FOSTER
D: Jim Foster. It is my absolute pleasure to meet you.
N: JIM FOSTER (late 40s) shakes Kurt’s hand up and down. Then bows to Brenda.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: And you are?
E: CONT'D
C: BRENDA
D: Brenda.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: Pleasure to meet you. Did you know, Brenda, that you’re datin’ the best damn quarterback in the whole state of Iowa?
C: BRENDA
D: So he tells me.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: You don’t believe him? You should, cause it’s true. Can I sit? Look. The elephant in the room. Sorry about the draft. But you have it all, kid. The whole package. The world just needs more time to see it.
E: he does anyway
C: KURT
D: See, he gets it.
E: to Brenda
C: JIM FOSTER
D: Yes. I do! And what if I told you starting tomorrow you have a job playing the game you love?
C: KURT
D: You a scout or something?
C: JIM FOSTER
D: No... I am the proud owner and head coach of the Iowa Barnstormers! Newest members of the Arena Football League.
C: KURT
D: Right. You’re the guy who invented that whole arena concept.
E: deflates
C: JIM FOSTER
D: Last year I was commissioner of the league. This year, I came home to Iowa to start my own team. And I want to build it around YOU.
N: Foster plops down a brochure for the Barnstormers. Cheesy and small time in every way.
C: BRENDA
D: So it’s arena... football?
C: KURT
D: It’s not football babe, it’s more like a circus.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: YES! That’s right. You get it! People LOVE the circus.
C: BRENDA
D: I like the circus.
C: KURT
D: I play FOOTBALL. And I’m gonna play in the NFL. This is for guys... circling the drain.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: Tell you what, just think about it. Get him to think about it. Here’s my card.
E: to Brenda
N: Foster drops four $20 bills on the table. Then he leaves, giving one more thumbs up out the door. Brenda looks at the cash on the table, gives Kurt a look.
C: KURT
D: It’s all the way in Des Moines, Brenda. And it’s NOT football.
S: 43 INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Kurt and Brenda enter. Arms full with diapers and milk.
C: KURT
D: We did it! We got the Regal to turn left! Just gotta throw it in neutral.
N: Larry, Jenny Jo and Zack sit around the dinner table.
C: JENNY JO
D: Saved you some food.
C: KURT
D: Actually just ate.... But sure.
N: He digs into the roast and potatoes. Doesn’t notice that everyone is staring at him, until... Larry clears his throat. Jenny Jo smiles. They trade looks, like there’s a joke Kurt isn’t in on.
C: LARRY
D: How’dya think the Bears will do this season, son?
C: KURT
D: Well, they fired Ditka. Probably gonna get worse before...
N: He stops mid-sentence, drops his fork. Looks to Larry.
C: KURT
D: Did they call? Are you kidding me?! Did somebody from the Bears call here?!
E: CONT'D
N: Larry shakes his head, acting despondent.
C: LARRY
D: No, they didn’t call. I’m sorry...
N: A LONG BEAT as Larry milks it for all it’s worth. Finally:
C: LARRY
D: The PACKERS called. They want to sign you.
E: CONT'D
N: Kurt’s eyes go WIDE. Jumps from his chair. Everyone YELLS all at once. Off this, we CUT TO: A CONTRACT. As Kurt signs his name. We pull out to reveal we’re in:
S: 44 INT/EXT. GMC CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY
N: It’s not a sports contract, he’s signing the title documents for a new car. A SALESMAN hands him the keys to a brand new, GREEN ‘93 GMC Jimmy. Brenda and Hudnutt are along for moral support. Kurt beams.
C: KURT
D: $5000 signing bonus, baby! Pretty great, huh? And it’s green... For Packers. Green Bay. Get it?
E: waiting for their reaction
C: BRENDA
D: Yeah, no we get it.

S: INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT
N: Kurt and Brenda lay on the couch in the dark, kissing. Kurt grins at her.
C: KURT
D: So how does it feel to make out with a professional athlete?
C: BRENDA
D: It was better before you said that.
E: beat
N: Kurt laughs, kisses her again, pulls his shirt over his head. Just then... THE FRONT DOOR OPENS. Brenda’s mom steps in.
C: JENNY JO
D: I have groceries.... Why are the lights out?
N: Kurt bolts up. Shoot! He looks around -- nowhere to go. So he runs for the WINDOW. Brenda tries to stop him, but he climbs out into the yard like a busted teenager, pulling his shirt on and tripping over his shoes. Brenda calls after him.
C: BRENDA
D: Yeah, run away, football player. Really impressive! Hi, Mom.
E: then
S: 45 EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - DAY
N: Kurt is packed and ready to go. Shakes hands with Larry. Gives Jenny Jo a hug. He bends down, picks up Zack. Zack hugs Kurt extra tight. Clearly emotional:
C: ZACK
D: Bye, bye, Kurt. Do good.
N: Jesse FUSSES in Brenda’s arms. Brenda hands her to Mom and they all go inside, leaving Brenda and Kurt to say goodbye. She kisses him. Deep.
C: KURT
D: You ever feel like your whole life has been leading to one moment?
C: BRENDA
D: Then go make the most of it.
N: He looks into her eyes. Sees a tinge of something, maybe fear. Something is off.
C: KURT
D: You okay?
C: BRENDA
D: Yeah. I’m really happy for you... Look, I know what this means. For you, your life - it’s gonna change. It’ll get busier, and bigger...
E: carefully
C: KURT
D: Brenda. Hey. We’ll figure it out.
N: She nods. Steeling herself. But won’t make eye contact. Processing.
C: BRENDA
D: Yeah, we’ll figure it out.
N: Finally, she looks into his eyes. One last kiss and Kurt climbs into his truck. Brenda watches him drive away.
S: 46 EXT. HIGHWAY - WISCONSIN - DAY
N: Kurt’s new truck speeds through lush green Wisconsin farmland.
S: 47 EXT. ST. NORBERT STADIUM - DAY

C: KURT
D: Hey! Minister of defense. This is... SO cool!
E: CONT'D
N: Reggie looks over.
C: REGGIE
D: Hey, kid.
N: Kurt puts out his hand, geeking out. But Reggie is mid- stretch. Not really a good moment to shake.
C: REGGIE
D: Can’t really.
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: Oh yeah, sorry.
N: Kurt ends up sort of patting Reggie on the head. It’s really weird. Reggie just chuckles. Kurt shakes his head, humiliated. Such an idiot. QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS, as Kurt is put through the wringer with the other recruits. 7 on 7 drills, warm ups, laps, etc. Kurt lines up behind center. Takes the snap, but before he can look up, he’s rushed. Panicked, he throws... an incomplete.
C: KURT
D: Damn, this is really fast.
E: CONT'D
C: REGGIE
D: Welcome to the NFL.
N: He pats Kurt on the head the same weird way and walks off. LATER, Kurt stands on the sideline, brow furrowed from reading the THICK PLAYBOOK.
C: VOICE
D: Hey Pop! Pop Warner!
E: O.C.
N: It’s the quarterbacks coach, STEVE “MOOCH” MARIUCCI (30’s). Kurt hustles over.
C: COACH MOOCH
D: You’re in.
N: Kurt immediately starts backpedaling.
C: KURT
D: Ah, Coach... I just got here. I don’t really know the playbook yet...
C: COACH MOOCH
D: You don’t want to go in?
C: KURT
D: Yeah. No, I just... Don’t wanna blow it out there. I’ll have it all down tomorrow.
C: COACH MOOCH
D: Detmer! You’re in.
E: moving on
S: 48 INT. MOOCH’S OFFICE - DAY
N: Kurt enters Coach Mooch’s office. Mooch shakes his hand.
C: KURT
D: You wanted to see me?
C: COACH MOOCH
D: Yeah. Thanks for coming, Warner. Wish you well.
N: Kurt stops. Confused.
C: KURT
D: Wait. What?
C: COACH MOOCH
D: We’re letting you go.
C: KURT
D: I don’t understand. I just got here. You guys didn’t even see me play.
C: COACH MOOCH
D: We saw enough.
C: KURT
D: No. I’m sorry, sir, but... I’m not leaving. Not yet. You can’t cut me.
C: COACH MOOCH
D: You cut yourself.
C: KURT
D: Coach, please, I’ve worked my whole life for this--
C: COACH MOOCH
D: You know how many times I’ve heard that? If it was true you’d have been ready to go on that field. You’re not. Good luck, son.
S: 49 EXT. STADIUM TUNNEL - DAY
N: AT A PAYPHONE, Kurt is mid-conversation with his agent.
C: KURT
D: I don’t know, you’re the agent. I mean what about Tampa Bay, San Diego? There were other offers. Can’t you make some calls?
C: RICH
D: Teams are making cuts, not looking to add players.
E: O.S. MORE
C: RICH
D: And definitely not players like you. I just don’t see a path forward. Sorry.
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: As that settles....
S: INT. KURT’S TRUCK - DAY
N: Kurt drives back, numb. Passes the sign “WELCOME TO IOWA”.
C: KURT
D: I don’t know what to do.
E: PRE-LAP
S: 50 EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT
N: Brenda sits with Kurt. Her hand in his.
C: KURT
D: I’ve called every team in the NFL and no one is interested. I wanna keep going, I do. But... look at me. I’m unemployed, I’m homeless... Oh yeah, Hudnutt’s movin’ to Des Moines.
E: off her look
N: Brenda processes this. Gets a thought.
C: BRENDA
D: Then... move in.
C: KURT
D: What?
C: BRENDA
D: With us. My family.
N: He looks at her. You kidding?
C: BRENDA
D: I’m starting nursing school. Could use a live in nanny. We’re both gonna be struggling, so...
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: Let’s struggle together?
C: BRENDA
D: Yeah. Together.
C: KURT
D: What’s your mom gonna think?
C: BRENDA
D: It’s your mom I’m worried about. That woman hates me!
N: They laugh.
S: 51 INT. BASEMENT - DAY
N: Kurt carries boxes to the basement. Followed by Larry, with a port-a-crib. Then Brenda, hefting a mini-fridge. There’s a carpet on one side, with a full-sized bed. Couch and a tv.
C: KURT
D: Thank you. For taking me in. Just a temporary --
C: JENNY JO
D: You’ll be sleeping on the couch, right?
N: Larry waves it off. But Jenny Jo is clearly uncomfortable with this. Kurt shoots Brenda a look. Told you.
C: LARRY
D: We’re happy to have you. Stay as long as you like.
C: BRENDA
D: Gotta run to class. I’ll be home late. Zack comes at 3. Baby’s sleeping.
C: KURT
D: I got this. Go!
S: 52 INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Zack and Kurt sit on the couch together watching football on TV, eating mac and cheese. Both of them loving it.
C: ZACK
D: Football!
C: KURT
D: Yeah Z-Man, you like it?
C: ZACK
D: How come you’re not playing?
C: KURT
D: I didn’t get picked.
N: Zack nods thoughtfully. Scratches at his eyebrow. Swaying back and forth.
C: ZACK
D: I pick you.
N: He holds up one of his trucks. Kurt’s face fills with love for this kid. He takes the truck and they start playing.
S: 53 EXT. LONG STRETCH OF WHEAT FIELD - SUNRISE
N: Kurt runs and runs, pushing himself. The sun rising behind him. LATER, he throws a worn football over and over. Keeping his arm up. He’s not giving up.
S: 56 INT. HY-VEE SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
N: The same market Kurt and Mike shopped at earlier on. The cashier rings Kurt up. Diapers. Cereal. Etc.
C: CASHIER
D: Twenty-seven twelve.
N: Kurt opens his wallet, feeling the strain.
C: KURT
D: Hey, you uh... take food stamps?
N: The cashier eyes him, nods reluctantly. Kurt hands over an EBT card. Then he spots a NOW HIRING sign in the window.
C: CASHIER
D: Anything else for ya?
C: KURT
D: No, that’s it.
N: He heads for the exit. Then stops, doubles back.
C: KURT
D: Actually. Ummm... can I get an application?
E: CONT'D
S: 57 INT. THE BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: The basement door opens. Brenda peeks down to find: Kurt, laid out on the carpet, Zack in his arms. Both of them stone cold asleep. Zack has built a whole racetrack up and around Kurt’s body, like Gulliver’s Travels. Brenda admires them for a moment. Then gently picks up Zack to put him to bed. Kurt stirs. Takes a breath. Opens one eye.
C: KURT
D: Hey, mama. Got a job today.
C: BRENDA
D: Yeah? Where?
C: KURT
D: Stocking shelves at the Hy-Vee. Graveyard shift.
N: Brenda nods thoughtfully.
C: BRENDA
D: That must have been hard.
C: KURT
D: Guess sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do... while you’re waiting to do what you’re meant to do.
N: He manages a genuine smile, and her heart fills with admiration for this man. Off this:
C: WEARY TEACHER
D: You need to re-set your expectations.
E: PRE-LAP
S: 58 INT. KINDERGARTER CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Kurt sits with Brenda in tiny plastic kindergarten chairs. Facing off with a WEARY TEACHER. Larry leans against the wall, off to the side. Brenda is already worked up.
C: WEARY TEACHER
D: Most retarded children require a special learning environ...
C: BRENDA
D: Hey! Zack is NOT retarded. Don’t call him that.
C: WEARY TEACHER
D: He’s... developmentally disabled. In my experience, he won’t be able to keep up with his classmates, and... frankly, you shouldn’t expect him to.
C: KURT
D: But we do. We DO expect him to. Look. Miss... Causey. Zack likes this school, he likes this class. We know what he’s capable of, and we’re not just gonna pull him out the moment things get a little hard.
C: WEARY TEACHER
D: We may not have that choice. If he falls too far behind...
C: KURT
D: Tell you what. We’ll make sure he doesn’t, how’s that sound? You do your job, we’ll do ours.
E: firm
N: Brenda exchanges a look with her father. Larry raises an eyebrow. Damn.
S: 59 INT. BRENDA’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Kurt works with Zack -- drawing letters on a Magna-Doodle. Zack is determined. But having trouble. Brenda peeks in. Kurt writes something on the board.
C: KURT
D: Can you read that?
N: Zack squints with his good eye. He can’t.
C: ZACK
D: What’s it say?
C: BRENDA
D: “I love your Mama.”
E: steps closer, reading
N: She looks to Kurt, surprised. Then rolls her eyes.
C: BRENDA
D: Really? THIS is how you’re gonna tell me you love me?
E: CONT'D
N: Kurt grins boyishly. What?? She just shakes her head and walks out. As she goes...
C: BRENDA
D: And yeah, when you stood up for him today... That was super hot.
E: CONT'D
S: 60 INT. HY-VEE SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
N: Kurt wears a clerk’s apron, stocking groceries. A WOMAN and her SON (10) push a cart past. She spots Kurt and pauses. Whispers to her kid, who wears a UNI jersey. Obviously recognizing him. Then her surprise turns to pity. Kurt sees. Trying to shrug it off. But it stings.
S: 61 INT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Kurt enters, just as THE SUN RISES. Weary, he strips off his apron. BEYOND tired. Morning rush hour. Brenda hurries to make a bag lunch. Her mom feeds the kids.
C: BRENDA
D: Gotta go. Back tonight at seven. Date night?
C: KURT
D: Sorry. Shift starts at 6:30.
S: 62 EXT. STREET - MORNING
N: Kurt runs the streets. Still training. Still believing. But WORN the hell down.
S: 63 INT. HYVEE SUPERMARKET - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
N: Cereal aisle. Kurt unpacks boxes of WHEATIES, each one with the FACE of Dan Marino on it. He stares at Dan’s face. Like “I could be that guy”. From down the aisle, another clerk, MARSHALL, calls out.
C: MARSHALL
D: Hey, Dan Marino! Pass me some Wheaties.
N: Marshall laughs at his own joke. Kurt FLINGS a box at him, then grins mischievously.
C: KURT
D: Awright. You wanna play? Game on!
N: He pulls out a canister of Quaker Oats, then crouches behind a pallet like he’s under center.
C: KURT
D: Number 13 takes the snap, pump fakes to the weak side, looks downfield... And lets it fly!
E: CONT'D
N: Marshall takes the cue, breaks long toward the seafood counter. Mr. Quaker spins in a perfect spiral toward Marshall’s outstretched hands. Except DEREK, the night manager, walks by and -- SMACK! The canister hits him right between the numbers, spilling wild oats everywhere. Kurt cringes.
C: KURT
D: I’ll get the broom.
E: CONT'D
S: 64 EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
N: The sun hasn’t yet appeared. Brenda walks out to find Kurt throwing a football against the garage roof, like when he was a kid. She watches him a moment. Steps up beside him.
C: BRENDA
D: Wondered where you were.
N: Kurt stops. Eyes on the ground. He speaks quietly.
C: KURT
D: Why would God give me this dream -- then not let me have it?
N: Brenda doesn’t answer at first. Then:
C: BRENDA
D: Maybe you should ask Him yourself.
C: KURT
D: Yeah, I don’t really do that.
N: Brenda moves closer.
C: BRENDA
D: Hey, listen to me. I’ve been through a lot, fit a lifetime of pain and regrets into a short number of years. So I know quite a bit about disappointment. And here’s what I’ve learned... Our struggles, they shape us. They make our stories unique. You really want to be like every other football player out there? With the same old story?
N: He shakes his head.
C: KURT
D: No, but I want to have a story.
C: BRENDA
D: Then, what did your coach say? Stay in the pocket.
N: Kurt takes that in. Turns to her.
C: KURT
D: I just want one shot, you know? Just to prove...
C: BRENDA
D: Prove what?
C: KURT
D: That I’m good enough.
C: BRENDA
D: Kurt... I don’t think a football game will ever be able to tell you that.
N: He lets out a breath, wrestling with that. Still unsettled. As the sun breaks through.
S: 65 EXT. BRENDA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY
N: Kurt mows the lawn, Zack on his shoulders. Larry steps onto the porch with sweet tea. Watches them. Then:
C: LARRY
D: Kurt, steal you for a second?
N: LATER, they sit together out of ear shot, braving a cold fall wind. Zack plays in the leaves nearby. Larry’s got his buck knife out, whittling a toy tractor.
C: LARRY
D: We bought our dream home, son. Down in Arkansas, close to Jenny’s family. Brand new ranch house. Two car garage. Sitting right down the road from the White River. Man, that’s good fishin’. So... we’ll be leaving soon.
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: That’s... great, Larry. Really happy for you.
C: LARRY
D: We were gonna do it a few years back. But stayed because... well, that’s what was needed. Thing of it is--
C: KURT
D: We’re gonna need a new place to live?
C: LARRY
D: I was hoping you’d say “we.” You two are good together. Brenda’s all stability, you’re all dreams. Would be nice to see her dream again. Look, Jenny Jo would want me to ask this. Good Christian family, after all. You love her?
E: stops carving
N: Without hesitation.
C: KURT
D: Yes sir, I do.
C: LARRY
D: Then what’s holding you back?
N: Kurt goes flush, but he thinks it over.
C: KURT
D: I guess... I wanted to prove myself first. Show her I could do what I set out to do. Be... worthy of her.
N: Larry nods with respect.
C: LARRY
D: Hell Kurt, accomplishing one thing or another -- that’s not what’ll make you worthy of her. Life’s not about what you can achieve, it’s about who you can become. It’s a journey, not an event. Just promise me this... that you won’t take off when things get hard. And they will get hard. My daughter’s been through a lot already, I can’t watch someone break her heart again.
E: let’s that sink in
C: KURT
D: Yes, sir.
N: Then Larry nods to Zack, still playing in the leaves.
C: LARRY
D: And take care of those kids for me.
N: Kurt meets Larry’s gaze, feeling the pressure of that. He nods and they shake hands.
S: 66 INT. RENTAL HOUSE - DAY
N: It’s winter now. THE FRONT DOOR OPENS to a humble rental home. Kurt leads Brenda and the kids inside. ZACK is 6 now, JESSE is 2. Toddling around.
C: KURT
D: Okay. We are walking through the front door. Ready?
C: ZACK
D: Ready!
N: It’s a total SLUM. Peeling paint, casement windows, and VERY warped floorboards. Zack inhales, taking in the smell. He puts his truck down, feels the first wall. Kurt and Brenda watch as THE TRUCK ROLLS DOWN THE CROOKED FLOOR TO THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.
C: ZACK
D: I like it!
E: CONT'D
S: 67 EXT. THE RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT
N: It’s snowing. Kurt rushes in from the car to the house, carrying groceries.
S: 68 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: He hands Brenda a bottle of pink antibiotics. Brenda and both kids huddle under the blankets on the couch, coughing and sneezing.
C: KURT
D: How’s the fever?
C: BRENDA
D: Same.
N: Kurt puts groceries away, stares into the half-empty fridge. He shivers.
C: KURT
D: What happened to the heat? Did we pay the bill?
C: BRENDA
D: I dunno, Kurt. You said not to put it in the mail. Remember?
C: KURT
D: Dammit.
S: 69 INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Kurt slams a kettle on the stove. Brenda steps in behind him, wrapped in her robe, holding a fussing Jesse.
C: BRENDA
D: I decided. I’m dropping out of school. Gonna get a job.
C: KURT
D: No. No way.
C: BRENDA
D: We can’t make it on one income at minimum wage. We’re buying groceries with food stamps and we still don’t have enough.
C: KURT
D: I’ll take more shifts.
C: BRENDA
D: Kurt, it’s not working. Nothing here is working!
C: KURT
D: You’re not going to QUIT, Brenda!
C: BRENDA
D: It’s what’s NECESSARY.
C: KURT No, STOP IT!
D: I have to believe there is something I can do! That I’m not... stuck on a bench watching a game I can’t change. So we are not giving up. Understand?
E: gathers
N: Brenda nods, stunned. She turns and goes back to the COUGHING children. Kurt stands alone, barely holding it together.
S: 70 EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
N: Patches of ice line the shoulders. The Jimmy speeds along a two-lane highway.
S: 71 INT. THE JIMMY - SAME TIME
N: Kurt stares out the window, stuck in his own head. Suddenly, a THUNK sounds from the engine. Kurt grips the wheel. The power steering is gone. The car slows.
C: BRENDA
D: Kurtis?
N: Kurt guides the Jimmy off to the shoulder. He stares at the gauges. Swears to himself.
C: KURT
D: I think we’re outta gas.
N: MOMENTS LATER Kurt and Brenda DIG in the seats for loose change. He finds a couple quarters. Moves on to the center compartment. Digs through wrappers and trash, excavates more coins. Brenda feels under her seat. Fishes out a dime.
C: KURT
D: Grand total? One dollar and seventy seven cents.
E: CONT'D counting MORE
C: KURT
D: I’ll be right back, alright? Everything’s gonna be fine.
E: CONT'D
N: Zack nods, SHIVERING.
C: BRENDA
D: Be fast.
E: warms her hands, nervous
S: 72 EXT. THE TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
N: Kurt half-runs down the road, keeping his bare hands in his pockets, breath visible in the freezing air. He reaches an intersection. Looks left, right -- no gas station. He glances back, worried. Then continues on. A COUPLE MILES LATER. His walking slows, face buried in his jacket. He’s exhausted, and lower than low. Finally he looks up and sees a sign in the distance.
S: 73 INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
N: Kurt drops all his change on the counter. The ATTENDANT barely looks up.
C: KURT
D: A dollar seventy seven on pump three, please. Do you have gas cans?
E: then, realizing
C: ATTENDANT
D: Yeah, five bucks.
N: Kurt’s face drops. He turns to the guy, desperate.
C: KURT
D: I just need to borrow a can. I’ll bring it back.
C: ATTENDANT
D: Sorry man, it costs what it costs.
C: KURT
D: Listen. My family is out there freezing in a car on the side of the road. I swear to you... Edward, I SWEAR I will come back here and I will pay you back. PLEASE.
E: reading his nametag
N: The attendant looks him over, finally relents. HE NODS.
S: 74 EXT. THE JIMMY - NIGHT
N: Kurt SPRINTS through the freezing snow, fingers numb from the gas can. But he refuses to slow. ON HIS FACE, genuine fear. He finally arrives. Rushes to the car. The windows are iced over. Looks like a tomb in there.
C: KURT
D: Brenda?
N: He pulls open the door. Brenda has both kids in her arms, under her coat like a blanket. They’re all SHIVERING.
S: 75 INT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Zack and Jesse are asleep in their room. Kurt shuts the door behind him, his face a mask of worry and self-loathing. IN THE LIVING ROOM, Kurt sits next to Brenda, who’s wrapped in a blanket in front of a propane TANK with a heater, GLOWING RED.
C: KURT
D: You coulda died out there.
C: BRENDA
D: It’s late, Kurt. Get some sleep.
N: Kurt blinks back the tears.
C: KURT
D: No. I promised your dad I’d take care of you.
C: BRENDA
D: Stop.
C: KURT
D: I’m a failure, Brenda. Stick with me and you’ll freeze to death. I just... try and I try and I keep letting everyone down. I don’t know why I can’t catch a break!
N: Brenda turns to face him. Her voice level.
C: BRENDA
D: Hey. Semper Fidelis. No quitting, no running away, right?
E: MORE
C: BRENDA
D: We’ll figure it out. Together. Now what do you need to do?
E: CONT'D
N: Kurt meets her gaze. Struck.
S: 76 EXT. COW PASTURE PRACTICE FIELD - DAY
N: One by one, HAY BALES are lined up in an open pasture, forming the outline of a football field, 1/2 the size of NFL. Gathered in the middle are a motley crew of PLAYERS. Has- beens and wannabes. There’s a hulking defensive lineman called TINY. An intense, jacked-up linebacker covered in tattoos, ALVAREZ. Jim Foster stands before the ragtag team, flanked by a muscled ex-NFL coach, RED BRUBAKER (50’s).
C: JIM FOSTER
D: Fifty yards long, eight yard end zones. Eight men each side. But this is not a football field --
C: TINY
D: Yeah, it’s a cow pasture.
N: The guys LAUGH.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: This is an arena for gladiators. For warriors who want a second chance. For true lovers of the game.
N: He walks up to the WALL of hay bales.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: And this is the sideline. Yes, in our version of the game the sideline is a wall. It will pound and punish you, trust me. And right on the other side, within arm’s reach, there are hundreds of screaming fans. In time you’ll come to love that fact.
E: CONT'D
N: Jim pauses, looks BEHIND the players. Surprised to see...
C: JIM FOSTER
D: Kurt... Warner. So, has hell frozen over? Or did you get tired of waiting on the NFL?
E: CONT'D Kurt waves
C: KURT
D: Both, sir.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: Forget everything you think you know about football. No punts. No turning back. All pressure. It’s football at the speed of Nascar. Think you can handle that, Warner?
E: smirks back at the players looks to Kurt
N: ON KURT, as he takes it all in, trying not to look intimidated. He nods.
C: KURT
D: Time to find out.
N: Then, from behind him, we REVEAL...
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: Well, well. Look who’s circling the drain.
N: Kurt turns to find MIKE. He smiles, gives him a BEAR HUG.
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: If we’re gonna go down, might as well go together!
E: CONT'D
N: LATER, IN THE PASTURE, Red runs the team through INTENSE drills. They SLAM and ATTACK with a fierceness Kurt has never seen. Alvarez SCREAMS like a crazy man, OBLITERATING anyone in his path. And loving every second of it.
C: ALVAREZ
D: That’ll wake you up in the mornin’. That will WAKE YOU UP!
N: Kurt’s eyes go wide. He steps up. Under center. HIKE. Drops back. Gets immediately CRUSHED by Alvarez. Kurt GROANS.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Feels good, right?? Pain feels good!!
E: CONT'D
N: He smacks Kurt on the back, fired up. Red calls Kurt out.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: Three step, drop! Get rid of the ball, Warner -- you look like you’re moving in slow motion!
N: Kurt struggles to orient. Looks to his three man line.
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: It’s fast. You’ll get used to it.
C: KURT
D: Hey. If this is where we practice, where the heck do we play?
N: A giant GRIN on Mike’s face.
S: 77 INT. IOWA BARNSTORMERS’ STADIUM - OPENING GAME
N: IN THE TUNNEL, Kurt gathers with his team, ready to enter. LOUD MUSIC and indoor FIREWORKS assault them from the arena inside. Fans SCREAM for their favorite players, like the WWE. Kurt takes a deep breath. Mike slaps his back.
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: We call this place the House a’ Horrors!
N: Kurt leans close to hear over the ruckus.
C: KURT
D: What??
C: MIKE HUDNUTT
D: HOUSE OF HORRORS!
C: KURT
D: Why??
T: SMASH CUT TO:
N: 78 THE OPENING GAME It’s ABSOLUTE MADNESS: - Players are FLIPPED into the audience. BOUNCING off the foam pads, and right back into the action. - Fans dressed like farm animals SCREAM at the players, throwing beer. - FIST FIGHTS break out in the middle of the play. Alvarez RAGES on the field. CRUSHING any player he sees. - Footballs BOUNCE off nets and back into the hands of the kickoff return specialists. Kurt just stares.
C: KURT
D: God help me.
N: FINALLY, Kurt has possession. He lines up under center. He drops back, gets SACKED before he can even look downfield. NEXT PLAY. Kurt tries to bail from the pocket. It collapses before he can get away. He takes a hard HIT. ON JIM FOSTER, PROWLING THE SIDELINE behind Red.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: Hey, Red. They got a lemon law for quarterbacks?
N: IN THE STANDS, Brenda watches, cringing. Kurt catches her eye. Frustrated.
S: 79 INT. “PERKINS” BAKERY - NIGHT
N: Kurt limps to a booth with Brenda and Zack. He groans painfully as he sits.
C: BRENDA
D: Is it bad?
C: KURT
D: Pretty bad.
C: ZACK
D: Can I see?
N: Kurt lifts his shirt a bit, revealing a large bruise on his ribs. Zack puts his hand on it - his way of “seeing”. Kurt recoils from the pain. Then Zack takes Kurt’s hand and puts it on a big nasty scrape on his elbow. Sharing injuries.
C: KURT
D: What happened, Z-man?
C: BRENDA
D: He took a pretty nasty fall yesterday.
C: ZACK
D: I’m ok. You’re ok.
E: shrugs
N: It’s not lost on Kurt that the 6-year-old complains less than he does. A WAITRESS sets down a giant cinnamon roll, topped with an entire stick of melting butter. Zack licks his lips, so stoked. Kurt sighs, venting.
C: KURT
D: I just have to find the rhythm, you know? Everything moves so fast, it’s just... off. It doesn’t feel like...
C: BRENDA
D: Football?
N: He looks up at her.
C: KURT
D: Yeah. Exactly.... You know only one arena player has ever made it to the NFL... I don’t know, Brend. I hope this wasn’t a mistake. I mean, we’ll be living in different cities and... I just -- I don’t feel like I belong here.
N: Brenda stops. That didn’t sit well.
C: BRENDA
D: Yeah? Where do you belong? Stocking shelves? You know, you might want to try a little gratitude. And maybe some humility. You’re not above them, Kurt. They’re your teammates. If you can’t win here with them, you’ll never win in the NFL.
E: off his look
N: Tension. Finally Kurt nods, but his eyes are on the table.
S: 80 EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - EVENING
N: The sun sets. It’s ICE COLD, which doesn’t faze Kurt. He’s still out there, working with Red. The only other player is Mike, standing in for center. Jim Foster watches.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: Three steps, drop and throw.
N: Kurt takes a SNAP from Mike and drops back.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: No, you don’t have time to drop back and settle. It’s faster than that. Step and THROW.
E: CONT'D
N: He drops back again. Throws again. Jim calls out.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: You’re thinking too much, Warner. There’s no time to think.
E: CONT'D
N: HOURS LATER. It’s dark. Kurt is still out there, alone. Dropping back and throwing at a painted square on a BARN.
S: 81 INT. IOWA BARNSTORMERS’ STADIUM - NIGHT
N: MID-GAME. Kurt lines up under center. Looks around. Takes a breath. DROPS BACK. THREE STEPS. THROW. Perfect strike. 20 yard gain. Kurt rushes up to center. Glances around. HIKE. Another STRIKE. And finally... TOUCHDOWN. The crowd CHEERS. Kurt beams.
S: 82 INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
N: Kurt packs up at his locker. Jim Foster strolls in, holding a wad of cash. He stops in front of Kurt, thumbs through $100 bills.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: Looks like you’re getting the hang of it. Here.
N: He hands him a few bills.
C: KURT
D: What’s this?
C: JIM FOSTER

S: 85 INT. KURT’S DES MOINES APARTMENT - INTERCUT
N: The players’ apartment is a DUMP. Like a HOSTEL for football players. There’s a party going on: players, cheerleaders, locals. All CELEBRATING. And Kurt in the middle, phone pressed to his ear. Yelling over the music.

C: KURT
D: Z-man, hey pal!! I miss you so much!
C: ZACK

D: He can’t hear you, Kurt. Listen, I should get the kids down. Are you coming home this week? Zack’s been asking.
E: frustrated
C: KURT
D: Can’t, hun. We got practice. I was thinking, what if you come on Saturday. Bring the kids.
N: More CHEERS behind him from a drinking game. Brenda’s heard enough.
C: BRENDA
D: I have to study this weekend. Look, I’m tired. Going to bed. Love you.
C: KURT
D: Wait!
N: She hangs up. ON KURT, frustrated.
S: 86 INT. IOWA BARNSTORMERS’ STADIUM - NIGHT
N: “GET READY FOR THIS” blares over the loudspeaker in the PITCH BLACK venue. Then cheerleaders light SPARKLERS. PYROTECHNICS blast. Kurt is FIRST MAN, ready to lead his team out.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: LET’S GET READY TO RUMBLE!!
E: O.S.
N: And the crowd goes WILD. Foster nods to Kurt.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: Told you!
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: What?
C: JIM FOSTER
D: You’d love the circus!
N: Kurt can’t help but SMILE. Kurt salutes, then CHARGES out onto the field.
C: COMMENTATOR
D: Kurt Warner is something to behold. They call him Houdini - the guy manages to escape from any situation. And he just keeps winning. He’s breaking new records with every game...
E: V.O.
N: IN THE NOSEBLEEDS, Brenda pushes through the HECTIC CROWD, toting Jesse and Zack. She covers Jesse’s ears. LATER. END OF GAME, KURT BOMBS one to the end zone. TOUCHDOWN! He’s making it look EASY. The crowd FREAKS OUT.
S: 87 INT. IOWA BARNSTORMERS’ STADIUM - NIGHT
N: AFTER THE GAME, Kurt stands surrounded by fans, other players. Brenda tries to work her way to him, kids in tow.
C: BRENDA
D: Excuse me. Excuse me.
N: She gets bumped by people rushing ahead of her. Then STOPPED by a security GUARD.
C: GUARD
D: You need a wristband, Ma’am. For the meet and greet.
C: BRENDA
D: No, I’m with Kurt.
C: GUARD
D: Yeah, you and everyone else. Still need a wristband.
C: BRENDA
D: No, we’re his family...
N: Then she looks down and realizes. Zack is gone. She instantly PANICS. Grabs Jesse’s hand and pushes backwards through people.
C: BRENDA Zack!! ZACK!!!!
D: Have you seen my son.
E: CONT'D to anyone MORE
C: BRENDA
D: He’s six, he’s.... He’s in a green sweatshirt. Anyone...?!!
E: CONT'D
N: She scrambles, frantic. Calling his name, pushing people out of the way. Finally she spots Zack pressed up against a trash can, rubbing his eyebrow and rocking back and forth, scared.
C: ZACK
D: Mama??... Kurt Kurt?....
N: Brenda rushes to Zack. Throws her arms around him. Thank God. She catches her breath, then looks through the crowd to Kurt. Still signing autographs. Oblivious.
C: KURT
D: I had no idea you guys were here! I thought you had to study.
E: PRE-LAP
S: 88 EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: The kids are asleep in the car. Kurt and Brenda stand outside, mid-argument.
C: BRENDA
D: That’s what “surprise” means, Kurt.
C: KURT
D: Then why are you upset?
C: BRENDA
D: I’m not. I just... I couldn’t get to you and then I lost Zack. And, it’s like... everyone else could and I couldn’t, and...
C: KURT
D: Because I didn’t know you were coming. But babe... we WON. We’re going to the Semi-Finals.
C: BRENDA
D: I know. It was supposed to be different....
N: From across the parking lot, Alvarez calls out.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Warner! Party’s at our place, man. Come on!
N: Brenda goes cold.
C: KURT
D: I don’t have to go to that.
C: BRENDA
D: Go ahead. We have a long drive back. You were great out there.
C: KURT
D: Yeah?
N: But it doesn’t feel that way. She gets in the car and starts the engine. No kiss. EMPTY. Kurt just watches her drive off.
S: 89 INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
N: Kurt grabs his stuff, SLAMS the locker, angry. Alvarez passes by, stops.
C: ALVAREZ
D: I feel for you, man.
C: KURT
D: How do you mean?
C: ALVAREZ
D: Dealing with all that, while we’re doing all this? Must be rough with kids.
C: KURT
D: Oh, we’re not... They aren’t my kids.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Really?? Man, you crazy.
N: He pats Kurt on the back. ON KURT, as that sinks in.
S: 90 INT. BRENDA’S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Brenda plops on the couch after tucking the kids in. Lonely. CLICKS on the TV. Sunday Night Movie night. She looks to the phone.
C: JENNY JO
D: How’s my baby girl?
E: V.O.
S: 91 EXT. LARRY AND JENNY JO’S HOUSE - INTERCUT
N: Brenda’s parents sit out on the porch of their new home, listening to the sound of the nearby river.
C: BRENDA
D: Hey Momma. Just fine. How are you?
C: JENNY JO
D: Just waitin’ on my Sunday Night Movie. Miss watching with you. So what does “just fine” mean?
E: beat
C: BRENDA
D: You know... just... fine.
C: JENNY JO
D: And how’s Kurt?
N: A long pause.
C: BRENDA
D: Far away. I don’t know.... maybe I’m not for him, Mom. Or maybe he’s not for me.
N: Just saying it brings tears. Brenda stifles a SOB. Mom hears.
C: JENNY JO
D: Hey. Don’t give up on yourself, Brenda. God still has a plan for you, that hasn’t changed.
C: BRENDA
D: I don’t know, Mom. I messed it all up. The Marines, my marriage... Zack. Everything. Whatever that plan was, I don’t think it applies anymore.
E: through tears
C: JENNY JO
D: Listen to me, young lady. You are strong, and beautiful, and worthy. And you’ll find someone who will love you the way you deserve to be loved.
N: Brenda wipes tears, trying to believe she deserves any of it.
C: BRENDA
D: Is Daddy there?
C: JENNY JO
D: Yes, and he says “Listen to your mother.”
N: Brenda laughs despite herself.
C: LARRY
D: Love you, baby girl.
E: into the phone
C: BRENDA
D: Love you, too...
S: 92 INT. KURT’S DES MOINES APARTMENT - DAY
N: Kurt lies on his bed, alone. Tosses the football in the air, lost in thought. There’s a KNOCK at the door. Kurt opens it to find Brenda. He’s surprised.
C: KURT
D: Hey. No kids?
C: BRENDA
D: No kids.
C: KURT
D: Oh. Want to grab some lunch?
C: BRENDA
D: Actually. Can you sit for a few minutes?
N: Kurt hesitates. Okay... IN THE LIVING ROOM. Brenda eyes the couches, tries to find one to sit on. They’re all GROSS.
C: KURT
D: Sorry. Jim got us this furniture. They pulled it from some flooded hotel downtown.
N: Kurt lays a jacket down. But Brenda pulls up a chair across from him and sits. Takes a breath, gets right to it.
C: BRENDA
D: Listen, I just want to say this, and get it out. And I want you to know, I’m not angry.
N: Kurt tightens, already defensive.
C: KURT
D: Angry about what?...
C: BRENDA
D: I’m not. I’m not angry. I’m... happy for you. For everything. For what’s happening in your life.
E: MORE
C: BRENDA
D: But it isn’t working for my life.
E: CONT'D beat
N: Kurt is trying to catch up.
C: KURT
D: Wait, hold up, Brend.
C: BRENDA
D: Let me just finish. I’ve been through this before, you know that. And I can’t do it again. I know where it ends. So let’s just... skip to that part. Save ourselves a lot of time and tears.
N: Kurt stares at her, can’t believe what he’s hearing.
C: KURT
D: I’m not your ex husband, Brenda, give me a little credit.
C: BRENDA
D: I do. But Kurt.... you have a dream to chase. And you deserve to chase it without any baggage.
C: KURT
D: Oh, so this is you looking out for me? Give me a break, Brenda, just be honest. You’re afraid, that I’m gonna bail on you, that I’ll hurt you...
C: BRENDA
D: I’m afraid we’re going to hurt each other! I’m just trying to be responsible.
N: That word triggers something in Kurt.
C: KURT
D: “Responsible?” Right. You need someone who can provide.
C: BRENDA
D: No, that’s not...
N: He gets up and walks from the room. When he returns he’s holding a jar stuffed with $100 bills. Hands it to her.
C: BRENDA
D: What is this?
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: My touchdown money.
N: She looks at him, confused. Hurt. This has gone all wrong.
C: KURT
D: I get it. You’re right. So let’s just do this now, get it over with.
E: CONT'D bitter
C: BRENDA
D: Are you paying me... to break up?
C: KURT
D: You broke up with me.
C: BRENDA
D: It was a discussion--
C: KURT
D: I gotta get to practice.
N: And he leaves, SLAMMING the door behind him. OFF her look--
C: COMMENTATOR
D: What a performance from Kurt Warner tonight. Five touchdowns. 432 yards in the air.
E: O.S.
S: 93 INT. BARNSTORMERS STADIUM - SEMI-FINALS - NIGHT
N: THE CROWD RUSHES THE FIELD as the clock RUNS OUT.
C: COMMENTATOR
D: And with that the newest team in the league, the Barnstormers, are going to the Arena Bowl for a chance to win it all!
E: O.S.
N: Amidst the celebration and chaos, Kurt is pulled in every direction. Reporters, fans, surrounding him. Begging for autographs. But Kurt is utterly lost. Then his gaze settles on a woman in the stands. It’s HIS MOM.
S: 94 EXT. IOWA BARNSTORMERS’ STADIUM - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: It’s late. They sit on the back of Sue’s flatbed truck. Kurt drinks a beer, spins a football in his hand.
C: SUE
D: Shouldn’t you be celebrating?
C: KURT
D: What do you think this is?
E: raises his beer
N: Sue chuckles. They sit for a beat. Kurt feels her watching him.
C: KURT
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: SUE
D: That’s not the face of someone who just made the Finals. Where’s Brenda?
E: then
N: Kurt shrugs.
C: KURT
D: Broke up.
N: She nods, already figured that out. But she doesn’t look happy about it.
C: SUE
D: Winning doesn’t always feel like winning, huh?
C: KURT
D: Never has. No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, no matter what I accomplish. Why is that?
C: SUE
D: Cause it doesn’t mean anything if you don’t have someone to share it with. I hope you don’t think you failed somehow, not playing for the NFL.
N: Kurt scoffs, a little bitter.
C: KURT
D: This is my purpose. That’s what you always told me, right? This ball “defines” me.
N: Sue looks at him, surprised. Realizing...
C: SUE
D: Kurt. That’s not what I meant. You were always good at it, sure. You enjoyed it.
E: MORE
C: SUE
D: But there’s not a ball or a game or a stadium in this world big enough to define you. You’ve grown up to be a good man. Those are not easy to find, I would know. But I’m glad Brenda found one.
E: CONT'D turns to him
C: KURT
D: Thought you didn’t like her.
C: SUE
D: I just... didn’t want you to struggle the way I struggled. But MY story doesn’t have to be HER story. You love her, you’ve stuck with her, with those kids -- and I am so proud of you for that. She makes you happy son, I’ve seen it. She makes you better.
E: with difficulty
N: Kurt takes a breath, fighting emotion.
C: KURT
D: So what do I do?
C: SUE
D: Go get the girl, dummy.
S: 95 EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
N: Kurt speeds along a dark interstate.
S: 96 INT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Brenda washes dishes. Hears a KNOCK. She peeks through the window, sees Kurt. Surprised. He speaks through the door.
C: KURT
D: Can we talk?
C: BRENDA
D: We already talked.
C: KURT
D: Come on, Brenda. Please.
C: BRENDA
D: I don’t think it’s a good idea.
C: KURT
D: You’re really not gonna let me in? Hello?
E: no answer
N: AN HOUR LATER, Kurt sits leaning against the door.
C: KURT
D: Would you please just let me in?
E: CONT'D
C: BRENDA
D: We made a decision. I’m sticking to it.
C: KURT
D: But what if it was a bad decision?
C: BRENDA
D: Is that how you feel?
C: KURT
D: I don’t know, I just...
C: BRENDA
D: Go home, Kurt.
C: KURT
D: I’m not leaving.
C: BRENDA
D: Suit yourself.
N: ANOTHER HOUR LATER, Kurt still leans against the door. Suddenly he hears COUNTRY MUSIC playing softly from inside. He peers through the glass and sees Zack, RADIO IN HAND. He sets the radio on the floor for Kurt. Then taps on the glass.
C: ZACH
D: I have to go to bed.
E: whispers
N: And he scurries off. Kurt smiles bittersweetly.
S: 97 INT. RENTAL HOUSE - DAWN
N: Brenda is up early. She peeks out the window to see: Kurt, asleep on the porch in an old lawn chair. She SIGHS, quietly opens the front door. Kurt springs awake.
C: BRENDA
D: I don’t want to wake anybody.
N: Brenda’s voice isn’t angry. It’s compassionate.
C: KURT
D: Brenda.
C: BRENDA
D: You’ll be fine without me.
C: KURT
D: But I’m better with you.
C: BRENDA
D: It’s okay. Just go.
N: She closes the door. He sighs.
S: 98 INT. KURT’S DES MOINES APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Kurt watches TV. Sunday Night Movie. The PHONE RINGS. He checks Caller ID. Smiles.
C: KURT
D: Hey, there.
C: BRENDA
D: Kurt...?
E: V.O.
N: Kurt’s smile drops. He can tell immediately something is off.
C: KURT
D: Brenda, what’s wrong?
N: She talks through HEAVING SOBS, barely comprehensible.
C: BRENDA
D: Kurt... oh my God...! My parents....KURT!!!
N: She’s WAILING now, unable to speak. Kurt leaps up.
C: BRENDA
D: Just get here. PLEASE get here.
E: CONT'D
S: 99 INT. ARKANSAS HORIZON - MORNING
N: Kurt drives as fast as he can. Worried. ON THE RADIO:

E: V.O.
S: 100 EXT. LARRY AND JENNY JO’S HOUSE - MORNING
N: Kurt pulls up to what was once Brenda’s parents home. It’s now just a concrete SLAB, surrounded by debris. Brenda stands in the rubble, looking lost. Kim and her husband JOHN stand nearby. All of them in shock.
C: KURT
D: Brenda!
N: Kurt jumps from the car and rushes to her. She COLLAPSES into his arms.
C: BRENDA
D: This was their house! This was their house!
N: Brenda drops to her knees on the concrete.
C: BRENDA
D: I was just here, Kurt. Two months ago. This can’t be real...
E: CONT'D
N: There’s a step in front of them that once led to the front door. Kurt pushes away the debris. Inscribed in the concrete: “L+J Carney”, then a heart.
C: BRENDA
D: That’s my dad’s writing.
E: CONT'D
N: Brenda bursts into SOBS. Kurt sits beside her.
C: BRENDA
D: WHY?? Why would He take them from me?? I’m sick of losing people! Sick of being let down!! I can’t do it anymore....
E: CONT'D
N: Kurt tries calming her, but she HITS him, letting out her anger. He swallows her into his arms. Just holds her.
C: KURT
D: I got you.
S: 101 EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
N: Brenda, Kurt, Kim and John sit in a small circle of lawn chairs in a motel parking lot, drinking beers in silence. Brenda holds a cracked photo of the family. The only one they found. She speaks softly, mostly to herself.
C: BRENDA
D: They’re gone. Really gone....
N: A long pause, as she tries to make sense of her own words. Then --
C: BRENDA
D: At least we know where they went. I’m trying to picture them up there now. Together. No pain. No tears... I’ll bet they’re dancing.
E: CONT'D
N: Kim nods. Brenda’s eye fill with fresh tears. But they’re different tears. She smiles, bittersweet. Then closes her eyes.
C: BRENDA
D: Thank you, God...
E: CONT'D a whisper
N: CLOSE ON KURT, amazed by this. That she can find a way to be grateful, even in this moment. Finally Kurt raises his beer.
C: KURT
D: To Larry and Jenny Jo.
N: They all raise a bottle. Brenda’s gaze lingers on Kurt for a moment. Then she stands.
C: BRENDA
D: I need to check on the kids.
C: KURT
D: No, I got it. Stay.
S: 102 INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
N: Kurt looks in on Zack and Jesse. Watches them sleep. He pulls the blanket up further over Zack. Softly:
C: KURT
D: I’ve missed you, buddy.
N: Kurt sits on the edge of the bed and lets out a breath. His first moment alone. He rubs his temples. Then his eyes.... And suddenly TEARS. Kurt sobs as quietly as he can. Then, from behind him, small arms wrap around his neck. It’s Zack.
C: KURT
D: Sorry, Z-man. Didn’t mean to wake you, I just...
E: CONT'D
N: Zack doesn’t say a word. Just wipes away Kurt’s tears. And hugs him. Kurt clutches him tight and just BREAKS. FROM THE DOORWAY, Brenda watches them hold onto each other. And somehow her shattered heart is mended just a bit.
S: 103 EXT. THE WHITE RIVER - DAY
N: Brenda and Kim each carry an urn. They walk with Kurt and John on a path toward the river. Suddenly, Brenda stops and pulls Kurt aside.
C: BRENDA
D: Ok, here’s the thing. I’m gonna remember this moment for the rest of my life. So the way I see it, if you’re not gonna be with me... I don’t want you in this memory.
E: he nods
N: Kurt nods again. Okay.
C: BRENDA
D: I mean it. It would be stupid that you were here. Right?
E: CONT'D
N: Kurt takes her hand. Looks her right in the eye.
C: KURT
D: It’s ok, Brenda. I’m gonna be here.
N: AT THE RIVER BANK, Brenda and Kim stand by the water’s edge. Kurt and John beside them. Brenda’s urn is open.
C: KIM
D: Um... I don’t know which one is Mom and which one is Dad.
C: BRENDA
D: Well, this one’s heavier, it’s probably Dad.
N: They both SNICKER.
C: KURT
D: Ladies.
C: KIM
D: Maybe we just... mix them together?
N: The boys shake there heads. Brenda addresses her urn.
C: BRENDA
D: Mom... or Dad...
N: Kim SNICKERS again, so does Brenda. Then the tears start.
C: BRENDA
D: I miss you. And I love you. And sometimes... there are no other words to say.
E: CONT'D
N: She kneels down and spreads the ashes. They float, then dissolve into the water. Then Kim steps forward and opens her urn. She pours the urn, but UP and OUT instead of down. The WIND kicks it back in her face.
C: KIM
D: Oh no!! UGHK, it’s in my nose! My nose!
N: Brenda busts out LAUGHING, tears still in her eyes. Kim sneezes.
C: BRENDA
D: God bless you, Mom!
C: KIM
D: It’s Dad!
N: The girls cannot stop LAUGHING. Kurt tries to hold out, but fails. Brenda looks back at him, and her smile says it all. I’m glad you’re here.
S: 104 EXT. MOTEL - MORNING
N: Kurt loads the kids into a cab, then turns to face Brenda. He wraps her in his arms. One of those long, warm moments.
C: BRENDA
D: Thanks for taking them. I’ll be back in a few days.
C: KURT
D: Least I can do. Whenever you’re ready.... See you at home.
N: Kurt waves goodbye to Kim and John, then ducks into the cab.
S: 105 EXT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT
N: John and Kim pull into the driveway. Brenda climbs from the back seat, bag in hand. She looks up to see: Kurt standing outside the house, kids beside him. Brenda smiles. Confused. What’s up?
S: 106 INT. RENTAL HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Kurt opens the door. The kids lead Brenda inside, excited. BRENDA’S POV: The ratty old house has been transformed. Rose petals line the hall. Flickering candles lead to the backyard. Brenda looks to Kurt. The kids GIGGLE. Zack leads his Mom slowly forward. Jesse follows behind, picking up the flowers. OUTSIDE ON THE PATIO A vase of roses on the table. And a boom box. Kurt whispers something to Zack, who grins and presses PLAY. Immediately: ‘Fishin’ in the Dark’ plays. Kurt takes Brenda’s hand and they start dancing. She buries her head in his shoulder.
C: KURT
D: Babe. All my life I defined myself by what I could do on that field. What I could accomplish, how many games I could win. But... I always came up empty. It was never enough. Like I was meant for something else. Something more. And you, you’ve been waiting all these years, for that promise. God’s big plans for you. What if it’s this? Us. Together?
E: looks into her eyes
N: Kurt hits a switch that LIGHTS UP the backyard fence with Christmas lights that spell out: “WILL YOU MARRY ME?” Brenda GASPS. Kurt gets on one knee. Holds up a little box.
C: KURT
D: Everything I want in the world is right here.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: KURT
D: It doesn’t matter if I play football, or if I don’t, or what I play or where. Because.... Winning isn’t winning without you. I love you. And I want what you have, babe. Your faith, your strength. You make me--

N: Super: ARENA BOWL. Kurt, mid-game. Playing hard. Having a blast. The crowd is LOVING HIM. Chanting his name. Brenda SCREAMS for him in the front row, kids by her side. Kurt throws a scoring pass. As he runs back mid-field, a BUSINESSMAN calls to him from behind the wall.
C: BUSINESSMAN
D: Hey, Kurt Warner! I want to talk to you after the game!
N: Kurt nods at the guy. Sure, pal. No idea who he is. But JIM FOSTER sees him and cringes. He knows EXACTLY who the guy is. LAST DRIVE. Kurt has a heck of a game, but they miss the win by ONE FOOT. In Kurt’s disappointment... POST GAME, Kurt greets fans, Brenda by his side. The Businessman approaches.
C: DAVID GILLIS
D: Heck of a game for you, Kurt.
C: KURT
D: Well, it didn’t help us win. I hate to lose, sir. Hate it for the team.
C: DAVID GILLIS
D: I’m David Gillis. We’ve been trying to reach you. We want you to come try out for us.
C: KURT
D: Try out?
N: Gillis waits for it to register. Kurt looks to Jim Foster, confused. Jim just shrugs.
C: JIM FOSTER
D: I’ve been... putting off his calls for a while. Can you blame me?
C: KURT
D: I’m sorry, WHO are you?
E: back to Gillis
C: DAVID GILLIS

D: I don’t get it, Dick.
C: DICK VERMEIL
D: I like him. It’s a hunch.
C: MIKE MARTZ
D: Arena Football? You really think that’ll translate.
C: DICK VERMEIL
D: Character translates anywhere.
C: COACH RAMSDELL
D: GM likes his price. I think our groundskeeper will make more this season.
C: MIKE MARTZ
D: He’s old, he’s slow as molasses. Frankly, he’s below the standards of this franchise.
C: COACH RAMSDELL
D: Got a howitzer for a right arm, though.
C: MIKE MARTZ
D: Why are we even talking about this? There is no way this guy makes the team.

S: 110 EXT. MACOMB, ILLINOIS - RAMS TRAINING CAMP - DAY
N: NFL Training Camp - the sequel. Kurt drives up and jumps from his truck. Like a racehorse breaking from the gate. ON THE PRACTICE FIELD Quarterback TRENT GREEN is the clear number one. Kurt watches from the sideline as Trent takes all the reps. And makes the HARDEST THROWS. Kurt’s not the only one with a strong arm. Mike Martz claps from the sideline.
C: MARTZ
D: Way to sling it, Trent!
N: Martz steps close to Kurt. Doesn’t make eye contact, just starts talking.
C: MARTZ
D: Packers called you up once.
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: Yes sir. Long time ago.
C: MARTZ
D: How long did you last?
C: KURT
D: Not long enough.
N: Martz nods. Exactly. He steps close. Looks to Kurt’s playbook.
C: MARTZ
D: Don’t get too comfortable, Arena boy.
N: With that, he walks away. Another player, ISSAC BRUCE, steps up.
C: ISAAC
D: Don’t mind Coach Martz. His bite is worse than his bark.
N: Kurt LAUGHS, grateful.
C: ISAAC
D: Let me know if you need anything. I’m Isaac.

E: CONT'D
N: Kurt shakes his head. Isaac steps close.

S: 112 INT. THE FILM ROOM - DAY
N: The quarterbacks and receivers watch film. IN THE FOOTAGE, Trent throws a pass slightly BEHIND Isaac, the receiver. Martz freezes the frame.
C: MARTZ
D: Now let me tell you why Trent put that ball there. He was trying to protect you from getting hit.
N: MORE VIDEO. This time Kurt makes a near identical throw, slightly behind his receiver. Martz explodes.
C: MARTZ
D: Kurt! You gotta hit him in stride.
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: Yessir.
C: MARTZ
D: What are you grinnin’ about, Arena Boy?
C: KURT
D: I don’t know sir... Just wondering why everyone moves so slow here in the NFL.
N: A couple guys CHUCKLE at this. Damn. Martz takes out a $50 bill and sticks it to a chair with a piece of chewed gum. As he walks out --
C: MARTZ
D: This is for Warner when he learns to throw a spiral!
N: ON THE FIELD. Kurt lines up behind JONES, his center. Jones flubs the snap. The ball SQUIBS away. Martz blows his WHISTLE, storms onto the field. Gets inches from Kurt’s face.
C: MARTZ
D: What the damn hell are you thinking?! HOW CAN YOU DROP THAT?!
E: CONT'D
N: The other players look around. WTF? They know Kurt never even touched the ball. Not his fault. Martz points over at Jones.
C: MARTZ
D: That man’s risking his life for you, EVERY SNAP!
E: CONT'D
N: More looks. Is Kurt just going to take it?
C: MARTZ
D: And you don’t have the dignity to HOLD ONTO THE DAMN BALL!? HOLD ONTO THE BALL.
E: CONT'D Throws the ball at Kurt
N: Kurt takes a breath, but keeps his mouth shut.
C: KURT
D: My mistake. Won’t happen again.
N: FROM A DISTANCE, Coach Vermeil watches. Isaac trots up beside him.
C: ISAAC
D: Just took a bullet for his team. You know what that is, Coach? Leadership.
E: raises an eyebrow
N: Vermeil nods. Taking it all in from a distance.

N: Kurt turns to face Coach Dick Vermeil.
C: KURT
D: Yes, sir.
C: DICK VERMEIL

S: 114 EXT. ST. LOUIS - NEW HOME - DAY
N: Kurt walks Brenda through a spacious, brand new house. It’s beautiful. She can’t believe it.
C: KURT
D: Nice, right? Sits on four acres.
C: BRENDA
D: Kurt. We can’t afford this. I mean what if you get traded. Or something worse...
C: KURT
D: Don’t worry, it’s not gonna happen.
C: BRENDA
D: How do you know that?
C: KURT
D: I’m trusting. Staying in the pocket. Isn’t that what you’ve been trying to teach me?
E: with a grin
C: BRENDA
D: Don’t even.
N: He hugs her. She takes in the huge empty foyer.
C: BRENDA
D: Seriously, though. Can we even afford this?
E: CONT'D
C: KURT
D: Hmmm, good question. Since I’m only making league minimum... $250,000.
N: Her eyes go WIDE.
C: BRENDA
D: DOLLARS?
N: And she practically tackles him.
S: 115 INT. TRANS WORLD DOME - NIGHT
N: Game on. The Rams have the ball. TITLE: ST. LOUIS RAMS EXHIBITION SEASON - AUGUST 1999 RAMS VS. CHARGERS Trent Green drops back to pass, delivers STRIKE AFTER STRIKE to the Rams’ fleet of talented receivers. Kurt, #13 in his Rams uniform and wearing a headset, CHEERS from the sidelines next to Coach Ramsdell, watches Trent complete yet another perfectly threaded pass.

C: COACH RAMSDELL
D: QB on fire.
E: smiles
N: UP IN THE STANDS, Brenda sits with three other Rams WIVES, all clearly younger and better dressed. They wear gobs of jewelry, full makeup and tailored jerseys with their husbands’ names on the back. Brenda is a fish out of water. OUT ON THE FIELD, Trent stands in the pocket, releases the ball just as the Chargers’ safety CRASHES INTO HIM. Trent falls to the turf, clutching his knee. All the players react. Issac throws his fist into the turf. ON THE COACHES. Dick Vermeil blinks. Martz’s face goes white. The TRAINERS rush out. Trent is writhing in pain. Kurt steps forward. Looking at the situation... then he glances up to the Jumbotron and realizes how bad this is. THE CAMERAS ARE ALL ON HIM. From this: MONTAGE OF NEWS FOOTAGE. THE KURT WARNER DEBATE HAS BEGUN: - Sportscenter. Every network and halftime report. Sports radio. The entire SPORTS NATION is talking about Kurt Warner.
C: SPORTSCASTER
D: The Rams hopes for a comeback seasons just went down with Trent Green.
C: SPORTSCASTER 2
D: There is NO WAY they trust their franchise to a rookie from the Arena Football league. They’re gonna have to recruit someone new, and fast.
N: And ON and ON....
S: 118 INT. KURT’S NEW HOUSE - THE LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Not much furniture yet. The TV blares SPORTSCENTER. Knees bouncing, Kurt watches intently, just like the draft years earlier. But this time the TV has his picture on it. Kurt watches and listens, taking it all in. ESPN TALKING HEAD (ON SCREEN) If you’d asked me a week ago with a healthy Trent Green, I’ve got the Rams going 8 and 8, but... Kurt Warner behind center - they’ll be playing for the number one pick.
C: OTHER SPORTSCENTER GUY
D: Agreed. The stock boy is never gonna cut it. But hey, maybe he can help them shop for a new quarterback!
N: They LAUGH. Kurt’s jaw tightens, then his gaze shifts out the window, to a new JOHN DEERE MOWER in the yard. He looks to Zack, playing with a BLACK TRUCK. Then he looks back to the TV and... it takes everything in him... Turns it OFF. Takes in the silence.
C: KURT
D: Hey buddy. Want to do something fun?
N: Zack nods. Kurt takes one last look at the TV, then...
S: 119 EXT. KURT’S NEW HOUSE - DAY
N: The mower travels in a big circle in the yard. Zack WHOOPS and YELLS, sitting on Kurt’s lap... DRIVING!
C: ZACK
D: I... AM... DRIVING!!!
C: KURT
D: Yes, you are.
C: ZACK
D: I wanna do it myself...
C: KURT
D: No buddy, you can’t.
C: ZACK
D: I’M READY! I CAN DO IT!
C: KURT
D: I don’t know if that’s a good idea.
C: ZACK
D: BELIEVE ME!
C: KURT
D: Momma wouldn’t like that.
C: ZACK
D: She’s not here!

C: BRENDA
D: Shut up, Jackass! You don’t know my husband!

C: KURT
D: Sit with me.
E: CONT'D
C: BRENDA
D: Kurt! Why would you let him do that?
C: KURT
D: He said he was ready... and I believed him.
N: Reluctant, she sits next to Kurt. Then watches for a minute as Zack drives in circles. She smiles.
C: KURT
D: Take it in, Brenda. That’s a blind boy driving a truck.
E: CONT'D beat
C: BRENDA
D: Tractor. And it’s not black.
C: KURT
D: Close enough.
S: 122 INT. MIKE MARTZ’S OFFICE - DAY
N: Kurt stands in Martz’s office. Waiting. He glances at all the pictures, memorabilia and swag on the walls. Finally Martz storms in. Looks Warner up and down.
C: MARTZ
D: Sit down, Kurt.
C: KURT
D: Thank you, sir. I’d prefer to stand.
N: Martz checks him. Interesting.
C: MARTZ
D: Go ahead, then. Tell me.
C: KURT
D: Tell you what?
C: MARTZ
D: Why a team worth eight hundred million dollars should put a stock boy in the driver’s seat. Because you threw some touchdowns in a little football arena? Sorry to burst your bubble, Warner, but you passed your expiration date. You’re too old to be a rookie, too green to be a pro. You don’t belong here.
E: Doesn’t faze Kurt
C: KURT
D: You’re wrong, sir. Just give me a chance and I’ll prove it to you.
C: MARTZ
D: You’re gonna make us the laughing stock of this league. You’re gonna embarrass yourself, every member of this team and every fan in this city.
C: KURT
D: That’s not true.
C: MARTZ
D: You do not have what it takes. That’s what I believe. So why in the world should I give you this shot?
N: Kurt meets his gaze. Doesn’t blink.
C: KURT
D: Because this is my time, sir. I know who I am and I know why I’m here. I’ve earned this. I’ve waited for it, I have bled for it, and I am ready for it. And I will not let you down. You give me the ball and I will win for you.
N: With that, he walks right out the door. Martz sits for a long beat. Then he nods. Smirks. Picks up the PHONE. And dials.
C: MARTZ
D: Hey coach... He’s ready.
N: IN HIS OFFICE, on the other end, Vermeil lowers the phone... a SMILE crosses his face.
S: 123 INT. RAMS PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY
N: Dick Vermeil faces a room full of reporters. There’s a BUZZ in the space. Questions flying at him. “What’s the next move?” “Can you tell us your plan?”..... Vermeil waits for it to quiet down. He leans into the mic.
C: VERMEIL
D: As a team, as a franchise, we have made a decision. And we stand by our decision. We will rally behind Kurt Warner... And we will play good football!

D: I do love a man in a uniform.
E: O.C.
N: Kurt turns back. His face lights up.
C: KURT
D: What are you doing -- how’d you get in here?!
C: BRENDA
D: I needed you to hear this before you went out on that field. It’s from our son.
N: She pulls a piece of paper from her purse. Flattens it.
C: BRENDA
D: “To my daddy Kurt Kurt. You fix all my radios. You walk to the gas station in the snow. You never give up on me. You never give up. You play your football game. I drive my truck. Love, Zack.”
E: CONT'D
N: Kurt wipes his eyes, overwhelmed.
C: BRENDA
D: That little boy has defied all odds, every time. Proved everyone wrong. And so can you. You helped me believe again. That all things are possible. Now it’s time to prove it to yourself.

C: PA ANNOUNCER
D: Number 13 -- KUUURT WARNER!!
E: O.S.
N: As Kurt runs out onto the turf, he points two fingers to the sky. Takes in the CHEERS, the spectacle, the sold out crowd. This is it. He made it. IN THE STANDS, Brenda joins Kurt’s Mom and Matt. And on Matt’s other side - Kurt’s father. They’re on their feet, SCREAMING and CHEERING. Sue gives Brenda a hug and Brenda points down at Kurt: ON THE FIELD, Kurt runs to the Rams sideline, helmet in hand. MOMENTS LATER, the National Anthem is sung. Kurt stands. Hand over his heart. And everyone CHEERS. Kurt finds BRENDA in the stands. Blows her a kiss. Vermeil walks right up to Kurt.
C: VERMEIL
D: You ready for this, son?
N: Kurt nods. Pumped. Then he looks across the field to the Raven’s linebacker. RAY LEWIS, #52. He’s an absolute BEAST. Staring daggers at Kurt.
C: RAY LEWIS
D: You’re all mine now, rook. ALL MINE!
N: Kurt swallows. OFF THIS: THE RAVENS KICK OFF. The football spins end over end as:
C: TV ANNOUNCER
D: Here we go! Rams versus Ravens. Brand new season! And you know Vermeil is taking a ton of heat for betting the farm on a kid whose resume is, well...
E: O.C.

D: Warner, getting into a nice rhythm here. 1st and goal from the 7.
E: O.C.
N: Kurt pump fakes, throws a slant to Faulk that is -- INTERCEPTED BY RAY LEWIS Kurt sprints back, attempting a tackle. He misses, but one hand grabs Lewis’ jersey, slowing him down enough for more Rams to stop him. Lewis PREENS for the audience. Beats his chest. Mocks Kurt.
C: RAY LEWIS
D: Eatin’ you for dinner, rook!
N: Kurt walks off the field. Deflated. He paces. Losing confidence. Suddenly AN ASSIST runs over to him, holding out a phone. Kurt takes it, looking up to the PRESS BOX. TO MARTZ. Where he calls plays from the Eagle’s Nest.
C: KURT
D: Yes, sir.
C: MARTZ
D: Warner, listen to me. You know why I was so hard on you for so long? I had to pressure you as much as possible. Had to know if you were ready. And guess what? You ARE. I would never have put you on that field if I didn’t believe you were a champion. Now get back out there and DRIVE. GET IT DONE.

N: ON THE FIELD, Kurt walks up to center. Isaac and the other players pat him on the head.
C: ISAAC
D: This was YOUR GAME Warner. So keep that ball!
N: Kurt smiles, catches the hike, then takes a KNEE to run out the clock. As the CROWD CHEERS, we cut to - CLOSE ON KURT’S FACE, through his helmet, down on one knee, he closes his eyes.... AND EVERYTHING STOPS, ALL SOUND FADES AWAY. And in this incredible, life changing moment, he silently prays...
C: KURT

C: COACH VERMEIL
D: Well done, son. Well done.
C: KURT
D: Thank you for believing in me, Coach.
N: -- and Kurt continues through, fighting against the tide, searching. IN THE STANDS, Brenda runs down toward him, calling his name, racing for the field, where... KURT FINALLY SPOTS HER -- -- and JUMPS up to the railing. Brenda leans over and Kurt hands her the winning game ball. She’s absolutely BEAMING. He draws her in close, face to face.

N: Kurt sits on the bench. Just like we met him. ANGLE ON the name on his jersey: WARNER. #13. WIDEN TO REVEAL.... IT’S THE SUPER BOWL! SUPER: SUPER BOWL XXXIV. RAMS VS. TITANS - JANUARY 30, 2000 Kurt stands. Surveys. Takes a breath. Clutches his rib cage in pain. Walks toward the field. Steps up to Coach.
C: COACH VERMEIL
D: How’s the ribs?
C: KURT
D: Still broken. But we’ve come too far not to finish this.
N: He looks to the SCOREBOARD that shows the game tied up, 16 to 16. Two minutes remain. A situation worthy of Dan Marino.
C: COACH VERMEIL
D: Damn right! Couldn’t ask for a better script. LET’S GO WIN IT RIGHT NOW!
N: Kurt walks onto the field. A man born for HIS MOMENT. Trades a glance with Isaac Bruce. FINAL HUDDLE. Kurt takes the snap. Protecting his ribs as he steps back, looking for his window. KURT POV - things slow down as the Titans’ defense CHARGE DIRECTLY FOR HIM, ready to crush him. CLOSE ON KURT - as he breathes, staying focused, waiting for his moment. FEET PLANTED. IN THE STANDS, Brenda watches, just as focused. She whispers.
C: BRENDA
D: Stay in the pocket, Warner...
N: And he doesn’t budge. Rears back to THROW. Here comes the rush. Knows he’s gonna take a HIT, and LETS... IT... FLY. AND IN THIS MOMENT, we quickly FLASH BACK TO KURT AS A KID, throwing the ball against his house... JUST AS #90 Jevon Kearse crashes into him. AND KURT HITS THE GROUND HARD. He quickly sits up and looks. The ball SPINNING IN THE AIR. OFF THIS -- WE CUT TO ACTUAL GAME FOOTAGE. And watch as the real Isaac Bruce catches it and runs it into the endzone. “THE RAMS WIN THE SUPERBOWL!” WE STAY WITH THE REAL FOOTAGE NOW. The real Kurt Warner, as he runs to the real Brenda in the stands. She leans down and he kisses her. AFTER THE GAME. Kurt talking to reporters. Thanking God. Thanking his teammates. Thanking Brenda. His family. Raising the silver Lombardi HIGH INTO THE AIR. An underdog. A champion.
S: TEXT OVER BLACK:
N: Kurt Warner’s touchdown throw in the 1999 Super Bowl broke Joe Montana’s all time post-season pass record. He was named the MVP of the game. The Rams’ 1999 season, known as “The Greatest Show on Turf”, is still considered one of greatest underdog stories in the history of sports. Kurt was inducted into the NFL hall of fame in 2017. He is widely considered to be the best undrafted NFL player of all time. Kurt and Brenda are happily married to this day. They have seven children. THEN... one final shot. Home footage of a high school graduation. It’s Zack, receiving his diploma. Zack graduated High School in 2012. Proving everyone wrong. Again. AND WE END ON the real Kurt and Brenda cheering in the crowd.
