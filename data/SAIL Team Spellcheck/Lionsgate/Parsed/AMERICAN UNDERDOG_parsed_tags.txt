0: 
N:     CLOSE ON A TV: JOE MONTANA drives down field in Super Bowl
N:     XIX for the San Francisco 49ers.
0: 
N:     TWO BOYS sit in front of a small TUBE TV. KURT (9), energetic
N:     and athletic, is glued to the screen, watching Montana’s
N:     every move. His brother, MATT (11), glasses and a natural
N:     bookworm, huffs as he watches. Mildly interested.
0: 
N:     Sports TROPHIES cover the humble walls and shelves.
0: 
N:     THE GAME ENDS. The 49ers WIN. Kurt fixes his eyes on the
N:     screen. On the celebration. On Montana -- and the number on
N:     the back on his jersey: #16. Then:
0: 
N:     DUCT TAPE on the back of an old t-shirt doubling for a
N:     jersey. The tape forms the number 13, with the name WARNER
N:     above it. Kurt smooths out the shirt, looks it over with a
N:     smile, and a dream. Then:

S: 2   EXT. WARNER HOUSE - SUNSET
0: 
N:     A brisk mid-western day. IN THE YARD, Matt lines up as wide
N:     receiver. Kurt calls HIKE, then narrates his Super Bowl win.
0: 
C:                         KURT
D:               Tie game with two minutes left.
D:               Warner drops back. He rolls left.
D:               Sees his man. Time running out
D:               AND...
0: 
N:     THROWS. But Matt breaks right instead of left and the ball
N:     DROPS in the grass. Kurt throws his hands in the air.
0: 
C:                         KURT (CONT'D)
D:               What was THAT?? I said left! You
D:               had ONE JOB!

C:                         MATT
D:               Easy for you to say, this is all

N:     Matt HUFFS toward the house, done.

S: 3   INT. WARNER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N:     Matt sits in front of the TV. Switches the dial to Channel 3
N:     and plays COMBAT on ATARI.
0: 
N:     THUMP! The football hits the wall outside and the TV goes
N:     STATICKY.

D:               STOP!
0: 
N:     A beat up Honda Accord sputters into the driveway. Kurt’s
N:     mother SUE (30s) climbs out. Weary and tired, she wears a
N:     work uniform and carries grocery bags.
0: 
N:     Kurt runs to her, wrapping his arms around her. It’s obvious
N:     how much he loves her.

D:               331 yards, 4 touchdowns, he rushed
D:               59 yards -- that’s more than their
D:               running back...!

0: 
N:     This triggers something in Kurt - he punches Matt in the
N:     shoulder and Matt punches him back. Sue grabs them both.

D:               BOYS! Enough! Eat your dinner, or

N:     Matt scowls at Kurt. But Kurt just stews. Then he STORMS OUT.

D:               Neither did I. But you got a shelf

D:               bein’ great at one thing.
E:                   (picks up the football)
D:               This is yours. But talent isn’t
D:               enough, Kurtis. You have to work
D:               harder than everyone else. Never
D:               quit.

D:               Then it won’t matter what people

0: 
N:      FINALLY settles at the distant bench. A player as far from
N:      the game as possible. We see his Jersey: WARNER. #13.
N:      Benchwarmer.
0: 
N:      KURT (now 22), square jaw. Perfect archetype of a QB. Except
N:      for the not playing part. His leg jackhammers up and down.
N:      Impatient. He’s dying to be on the field. Looks to the
N:      scoreboard: IT’S LATE IN THE GAME. They’re losing.
0: 
N:      The UNI QB runs off the field after a three and out,
N:      frustrated. Argues with HEAD COACH ALLEN, making excuses.

D:                There is no game. That’s the

D:                get here and I’ve been sitting on a
D:                bench for four years. I can’t get

D:                It’s gonna be a fun night!
0: 
N:      And heads off to greet his friends, leaving Kurt by himself.
N:      Looking very out of place in a t-shirt, jeans and sneakers.
0: 
N:      As Mike stomps into the dancing crowd, Kurt heads straight
N:      for the bar. Within seconds, every BLONDE seems to be eyeing
N:      him. But Kurt can’t be bothered.
0: 
N:      LATER, the dancing continues, but Kurt hasn’t budged. He just
N:      sips his beer, ignoring the women circling him. Then he looks
N:      to the DANCE FLOOR and his gaze lands on:
0: 
N:      ONE GIRL. In the middle of the action. Short skirt, cowboy
N:      boots and spikey dark hair. She’s brash and badass and funny
N:      all at the same time. This is BRENDA MEONI (25).
0: 
N:      Brenda dances with a HELL’S ANGEL three times her age, then
N:      spins away and joins a skinny rodeo guy, then moves on again,
N:      from guy to guy, but not flirting -- it’s all about the
N:      dancing. And SHE’S GREAT AT IT. She lights everyone up around
N:      her, and Kurt is immediately captivated.
0: 
N:      He steps closer, watching her. Then Brenda turns his way and
N:      THEIR EYES MEET...
0: 0:                                                               9.
0: 
0: 
N:      And for just a split-second... EVERYTHING SEEMS TO STOP. The
N:      room goes quiet. Kurt is locked in. Doesn’t even blink.
N:      Brenda meets his gaze, curious.
0: 
N:      Kurt takes a step toward her on the DANCE FLOOR when:

C:                          BARTENDER (O.S)
D:                All right y’all, line up, it’s a
D:                BARN DANCE!
0: 
N:      Everyone scrambles, guys in one line facing girls in another.
N:      Hudnutt included. And Brenda still right in the middle of it
N:      all. Kurt retreats, back to the bar. Total fish out of water.
N:      But he keep his eye locked on Brenda. Who is this girl??

S: 13   EXT. NORTHERN IOWA STADIUM - DAY
0: 
N:      MID-PRACTICE. Kurt drops back in the pocket. He looks up to
N:      see the DEFENSE RUSHING HIM. And he panics. Kurt SCRAMBLES
N:      BACK.

C:                          COACH ALLEN
D:                Stay in the pocket, Warner!
0: 
N:      Kurt dodges to the sideline, but still makes a stellar throw.
N:      Caught 25 yards downfield. Kurt looks to the coach. Not
N:      impressed.
0: 
C:                          KURT (PRE-LAP)
D:                You promised me. You promised if I
D:                waited my turn I’d play.
0: 
N:      AFTER PRACTICE, Kurt faces off with the Coach. Frustrated.

C:                          COACH ALLEN
D:                My promise to this university is to
D:                put the best out on the field.
0: 
C:                          KURT
D:                If the best were on the field we’d
D:                be winning! I can win for you, it’s
D:                what I’ve been doing my whole life!

D:                You know what your problem is,
D:                Warner? Want me to sum it up for
D:                you? Why you’re such a tragedy? You
D:                don’t stay in the pocket.

D:                You have the talent, loads of it.
D:                But when things get hard, you bail.
D:                You run from adversity. You don’t
D:                trust your team or my playbook.
E:                    (as Kurt tries to object)
D:                Staying in the pocket means
D:                standing your ground and taking the
D:                hit, no matter how much it hurts.
D:                That’s what leaders do. And you’re
D:                not a leader.
0: 
C:                          KURT
D:                That’s not true! Give me a shot to
D:                prove myself. Let me start one
D:                game.
0: 
C:                          COACH ALLEN
D:                Practice is where you prove
D:                yourself. You don’t deserve to play
D:                in the game.
0: 
N:      Coach walks away. Kurt chase after.

C:                          KURT
D:                Coach, wait! Ten more games and my

D:                whole life for this. PLEASE.
0: 
C:                          COACH ALLEN
D:                You need to start thinking about
D:                life after football, son.
0: 
N:      Kurt steps in front of him, defiant.
0: 
C:                          KURT
D:                No. I WILL NOT QUIT, sir. Just TELL
D:                ME WHAT I NEED TO DO.
0: 
N:      Coach studies Kurt. This kid. But there IS a fire in him.

S: 14   EXT. FOOTBALL PRACTICE FIELD - DAY
0: 
N:      WHAM! Kurt gets SLAMMED hard by a MASSIVE DEFENSIVE END. He
N:      hits the ground. Looks to the coach in confusion.

C:                          COACH ALLEN
D:                Again!

N:      Kurt shakes it off and lines up for a snap. Hike! Drops back
N:      in the pocket and WHAM!!! Taken down again.

0: 
C:                          COACH ALLEN
D:                As many as I say. You take the hit.
D:                No matter what comes at you. You
D:                can throw, but you cannot leave the
D:                pocket. You want your shot, you
D:                take the pain.
0: 
N:      MOMENTS LATER... WHAM!! Another BRUTAL hit.
0: 
N:      NEXT ONE - Kurt gets off a haphazard throw, but still gets
N:      drilled to the ground.

C:                          COACH ALLEN (CONT'D)

S: 15   EXT. HY-VEE SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - LATER
0: 
N:      Mike and Kurt push their cart from the market, loaded up on
N:      chips and donuts. Mike already chows down on a bag of Nachos.
0: 
N:      Kurt limps along, sore, leaning on the cart. They pass a
N:      STOCK BOY, hard at work unpacking a pallet. Mike nudges Kurt.
0: 
C:                          MIKE HUDNUTT
D:                Could be worse, right?
0: 
N:      He slaps Kurt on the back. Kurt winces. Glancing one more
N:      time at the stock boy. As they approach Mike’s truck:

C:                          KURT
D:                Teach me to dance.

C:                          KURT
D:                No. Like that... you know, the Barn
D:                Dance. For instance.
0: 
N:      And sure enough, Mike LAUGHS. Loud. Milking it. Finally...
0: 
N:      MOMENTS LATER The groceries are in the flatbed but the stereo
N:      is BLASTING Tim McGraw. Mike leads Kurt through the Barn
N:      Dance moves. Mike is still laughing. The stock boy watches
N:      them, like “What in the literal hell?”

S: 16   INT. WILD E. COYOTE BAR - NIGHT

N:      Kurt still wears his normal jeans and t-shirt, but this time
N:      he’s sporting one of Mike’s giant belt buckles. Mike GRINS.

D:                You know how happy this makes me?

N:      Kurt ignores him, scanning the crowd for Brenda. He steps up
N:      to the bar, nods to the bartender, who’s also the DJ.

C:                          KURT
D:                You guys have daiquiris?
0: 
N:      The bartender looks at him, deadpan. Kurt glances behind the
N:      bar to a pin up CALENDAR and he does a double take. It’s
N:      Brenda. On the calendar. In a bright red shirt, jean shorts
N:      and big boots - “Miss August”.
0: 
N:      Then he hears her voice and turns... THERE SHE IS. On the
N:      dance floor, as always. Brenda spots him, too. As if she was
N:      hoping.

D:           Please.

C:                     BARTENDER (O.S.)
D:           Aright! Barn dance, everyone!
0: 
N: A SONG STARTS and Brenda jumps into position. Kurt quickly
N: steps over, joins the line of men, facing off with the women.
N: He does his best to keep up, using the moves Mike taught him,
N: but his attention is mainly on getting to Brenda.
0: 
N: Kurt cheats a few times, skipping the girl he’s supposed to
N: do-si-do with, messing up the dance a bit, until finally --
0: 
N: He is FACE to FACE with her. Brenda raises an eyebrow.
0: 
C:                     BRENDA
D:           About time.
0: 
N: He smiles. So does she. Kurt takes her by the hand and they
N: dance. He struggles to do the steps properly, while she is
N: smooth as silk.

D:           Nope. Not yet.

N: front of Brenda. Over the music:

0: 
N: He causes another traffic jam. She just smiles and keeps
N: dancing.
0: 
N: LATER. AT THE BAR. Brenda drinks a dark lager. Kurt nurses a
N: daiquiri, complete with an umbrella. Brenda eyes it, judging.

D:           That’s ah... Well... it’s a “Hot

D:           so... God, this is embarrassing.
E:               (A look. A moment. Then...)
D:           So football. Give me an honest

D:           struggling, never had enough. And I
D:           wanted.... more. To make something
D:           of myself. And football was all I
D:           was ever good at. As long as I had
D:           a ball in my hand, I felt like
D:           everything was gonna be alright. I

E:               (she grins)
D:           So it’s more than a game for me.

D:           She won’t tell me her name.
0: 
N: He’s being a ham, and everyone buys in. Except Brenda, who
N: rolls her eyes. She steps forward and turns Kurt back around
N: to face the right way.
0: 
N: AND NOW IT’S MIDNIGHT. They’re slow dancing. And Kurt is very
N: happy about it. The place has mostly cleared out. The night
N: belongs to them. A slower song begins -- ‘Fishin’ in the
N: Dark’ by Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Brenda perks up.

N:      A small room, squeezed with two twin beds and a crib. Brenda
N:      lays the baby down, then kicks off her boots, exhausted.
0: 
N:      Brenda snuggles next to ZACK (4) in a bed too small for the
N:      two of them. Zack feels for her hand, pulls it right over his
N:      heart. He whispers.

N:      Morning rush. Brenda gets the kids ready. She wears an old
N:      robe, no makeup, hair a mess. BABY JESSE CRIES at the table.
N:      Refuses to eat apple sauce.

C:                          BRENDA
D:                Eat your food and you can get down.
0: 
N:      Jesse unleashed more FURY. Zack rounds the corner, hand
N:      touching the wall for guidance. It’s obvious he’s disabled,
N:      possibly blind, but it doesn’t slow him down. He holds an old
N:      radio in his hand.

D:                feed Jesse.

N:      WHAM. Apple sauce sprays all over Brenda’s robe and hair.

D:                Jesse! NO! No.
0: 
N:      Jesse LAUGHS now. More sauce on the walls. THEN:
0: 
N:      A KNOCK on the sliding glass door, covered by vertical
N:      blinds. Brenda looks up. Totally confused.

C:                          BRENDA (CONT'D)
D:                Mom? Dad? Just a minute!

N:      She twists the blinds open to reveal... KURT. Smiling.

D:                Wha... Hi. Can you just. Ah...
0: 
N:      Then she realizes what she’s wearing. She brushes her hand
N:      through her hair. Feeling the apple sauce.
0:

N:      She CLOSES the blinds before he can say anything.

N:      OUTSIDE, Kurt waits. He looks around. Fiddles with the rose.

D:                This was such a bad idea.
0: 
N:      Finally the blinds twist open. Kurt smiles, but NO ONE is
N:      there. Then the door unlocks and slides open.
0: 
N:      Kurt looks down to see... ZACK. Still holding the radio. He
N:      reaches out and touches Kurt’s jeans. His version of seeing.

N:      Zack leads Kurt down the hallway. Kurt looks to the mess at
N:      the kitchen table. Apple sauce still drips down the walls.
N:      But Brenda is nowhere to be found.
0: 
N:      ON THE MANTLE, Kurt notices PHOTOS of Brenda in full MARINE
N:      UNIFORM.

N:      Zack walks to the door of the bedroom, points to a radio that
N:      sits beside the bed. It PLAYS COUNTRY MUSIC softly. Zack
N:      walks over and taps the working radio.
0: 
N:      Kurt peers in at the unmade beds, crammed next to each other.
N:      Then Zack pulls him into the...

N:      GAME TIME. The opposition prepares to PUNT.
0: 
N:      ON THE SIDELINES, Kurt is in his familiar spot, keeping the
N:      bench warm. He eyes the Coach, watching him argue with the
N:      STARTING QB. Suddenly, in frustration, Coach calls out:

D:           You’ll need that.
0: 
N: Points to Kurt’s helmet. Still on the bench. Kurt grabs it.
0: 
N: FIRST DOWN. Kurt takes the hike. Drops back, surveys. The
N: pocket collapses and he gets SACKED. He gets up and looks at
N: Coach.
0: 
N: SECOND DOWN. Kurt HANDS OFF. The D LINE suffocates the
N: tailback for a loss.
0: 
N: THIRD DOWN. Kurt drops back, surveys coverage. NOTHING. And
N: here they come. The pocket collapses -- AND KURT RETREATS.
0: 
N: He darts left towards the sideline. Looking across the field
N: as he goes...
0: 
N: JUST BEFORE he runs out of bounds he leaps and throws across
N: his body to the OTHER SIDE of the field. Fifty yards later a
N: WIDE RECIEVER catches it for a TOUCHDOWN. A PERFECT and
N: IMPOSSIBLE throw. The crowd goes WILD. The STARTING QB is NOT
N: happy. But the other players gape.
0: 
N: Even Coach raises an eyebrow. Kurt BASKS in the moment.

D:           When I was maybe twelve, after

D:           gonna do something great with you.”
D:           And I... had the audacity to

D:           becoming a Marine and marrying a
D:           Marine and having little Marine
D:           children. God and country all the

D:           I met Neil. Perfect Marine. We were
D:           the perfect couple. Whirlwind
D:           romance. Marriage. I’m 20 years old
D:           at the time. Zack was born a year

E:               (with difficulty)
D:           It was an accident. Just one of

D:           save my baby boy. And he did.
D:           Doctors said his brain was like
D:           Swiss cheese. First of all, who
D:           says that? Who tells a mother
D:           that?? They said he would never
D:           walk, and yet...
E:               (she smiles)
D:           That he would never talk, and now I

E:               (gathers)
D:           Then, from bad to worse, when I was
D:           eight months pregnant with this
D:           one, Neil decided to cheat on me.
D:           So... yeah. I have trust issues.
D:           I’ve been hurt. You gonna hurt me,
