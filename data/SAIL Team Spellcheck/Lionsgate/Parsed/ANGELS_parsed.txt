M: A STEADY BEEP over a BLACK SCREEN.
M: CHYRON: This is a true story.
T: FADE UP to...
N: A HEART MONITOR. A BRIGHT GREEN LINE bouncing across it.
C: ASHLEY
D: MOMMY!
E: O.S.
N: ASHLEY SCHMITT (4), boundless energy, wise beyond her years, runs into a HOSPITAL ROOM, followed by... ...her dad, ED SCHMITT (30’s), easy-going, rugged good looks, a guy who showers after work, not before. He’s dressed in his cleanest short-sleeve button up and a well- worn JOHN DEERE CAP.
C: ED
D: Someone’s excited to meet her baby sister.
N: On the bed is TERESA SCHMITT (30), glowing through her exhaustion, cradling newborn daughter MICHELLE, less than an hour old.
C: TERESA
D: Ashley, come here sweetie, say hi to Michelle.
N: Ashley climbs onto the bed to get a look at the new baby.
C: TERESA
D: Now you’re a big sister, you know what that means? It means you gotta protect her, keep her safe, okay. You promise?
C: ASHLEY
D: I promise, mama.
N: Ed gives Ashley a little squeeze, then leans in, gently kisses baby Michelle on the forehead. He takes off his BALLCAP and slips it on her head.
C: ED
D: There ya go. She might be tiny, but we’ll have her drivin’ a backhoe in no time... We did good, baby.
E: to Teresa
N: (CONTINUED) Revision 2. CONTINUED:
C: TERESA
D: She’s beautiful, isn’t she?
C: ED
D: Like her mama.
N: Ed grins at Teresa. She grins back. In this moment, the whole world is theirs.
C: VOICE
D: Mr. Schmitt?
E: O.S.
N: As we cut to the person talking, the THE SCENE SUDDENLY CHANGES. Still a hospital room, but a DIFFERENT one. NIGHT time. The room dim, quiet. A DOCTOR, 40’s, stands in the doorway.
C: DOCTOR
D: Mr. Schmitt...?
N: Ed turns around. 4 years has passed. It might as well be 40. He looks exhausted, ground down by life. Next to him, Teresa lies in a hospital bed, her skin colorless, very little life left in her.
C: DOCTOR
D: Her blood pressure is starting to fall... it’ll be any moment now...
E: delicately
N: Ed nods, understanding.
C: DOCTOR
D: We’ll give you some privacy.
N: She looks at him sympathetically, gestures to the NURSE. They quietly exit the room so he can say goodbye. Ed looks down at Teresa. How does he do this? Where does he even begin? Finally...
C: ED
D: Teresa... I will always love you, for all time.
N: He pulls her hand up to his face to feel her fingers against his cheek. (CONTINUED) Revision 3. CONTINUED:
C: ED
D: You can rest now, baby. I’ll take care of our girls. I promise.
N: Slowly, the beep of the heart rate monitor falls, giving way to the SOLID TONE of a flatline. Ed listens to the tone, the finality of it. It doesn’t seem real.
S: EXT. ED’S NEIGHBORHOOD - THAT NIGHT
N: A blue-collar suburb. Quiet and dark, everyone turned in for the night.
S: INT. ED’S TRUCK - SAME
N: Ed rumbles down the road, his mind a million miles away.
S: EXT. ED’S HOUSE - SAME
N: He pulls into his driveway, climbs out, heads up the walk to his SMALL BRICK ONE-STORY. Modest, but well kept. He puts the key in the lock, and notices the MAILBOX tacked to the siding is crooked. He straightens it. It falls again. Needs a new screw. He steps into --
S: INT. ED’S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: His mom and dad wait for him at the dining room table, BARBARA (60s), salt of the earth, the backbone of the family, ED SENIOR (60’s), quiet, unflappable.
C: ED
D: Hey...
N: They both get up, rush over to him.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh Ed.
N: Barbara wraps her arms around him. Ed Senior gives him a hug too, then a hardy shoulder squeeze: Stay strong.
C: ED
D: Do the girls know?
N: (CONTINUED) Revision 4. CONTINUED: Barbara nods.
C: BARBARA
D: Helped a little they’ve known it was coming... Fell asleep about half hour ago.
N: Ed nods, heading down the hall, into--
S: INT. ASHLEY AND MICHELLE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Pink walls, two twin beds separated by a nightstand. He kisses a sleeping Ashley, now 8, on her forehead. Then crosses the room to check on Michelle, now 4. There’s an OXYGEN TUBE in her nose, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT near her bed. Ed adjusts the TUBE, checks the levels on the machine, then kisses her too. He gently shuts their door, goes back out to--
S: INT. ED’S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: He gets a TOOL BOX from the HALL CLOSET, walks out to--
S: INT. ED’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
C: ED
D: You’re okay to drive?
N: He walks past them, opens the front door, begins working to fix the mailbox. Focused. Quiet. Barbara watches him, concerned.
C: ED SENIOR
D: Yeah, just fine.
N: Ed Senior puts a hand on her back, gesturing for them to go, let him be. She gathers up her things.
S: EXT. GOLDEN NUGGET BAR - NIGHT
N: A local DIVE. Old neon sign blinking above the door. Revision 5.
S: INT. GOLDEN NUGGET BAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Packed on a Friday night. Construction workers, cowboys, local drunks. The air thick with cigarette smoke. At the BAR, SHARON (39), big hoop earrings, too much eye- make-up, a rough-around-the-edges beauty -- gets ready to knock back TEQUILA SHOTS with THREE CRAGGY-FACED BIKER GUYS, and her friend ROSE (late 40’s), African-American, warm but no-nonsense. Sharon sprinkles SALT on the back of everyone’s hands, passes out LEMON WEDGES.
C: SHARON
D: You know the drill, lick it drink it suck it. One, two, three and go!
N: They all lick the salt, take the shot, suck the lemon. Their faces pucker in unison.
C: SHARON
D: You forgot the salt!
E: laughs, slurring
C: BIKER GUY
D: Aw shit, better do another one. 5 more.
E: to Bartender
C: ROSE
D: 3’s fine. We’re good for a sec.
C: SHARON
D: Make it 4. It’s Friday. No fun- hatin’ allowed.
N: Rose gives Sharon a little look: Pace yourself. Sharon grins, used to Rose’s mothering-friend routine. She leans in, yelling into her ear over the MUSIC.
C: SHARON
D: I’m tryin’a make one of these guys look pretty.
C: ROSE
D: Honey, there ain’t enough booze in this place.
N: Sharon laughs as she reaches for the next shot. Rose bites her tongue. Sharon’s a big girl. (CONTINUED) Revision 6. CONTINUED: They knock back another round just as Brooks & Dunn’s Boot Scootin’ Boogie comes on. Sharon’s face lights up. This is her jam.
C: SHARON
D: “OUT IN THE COUNTRY, PAST THE CITY LIMITS SIGN--”
E: sings along
N: She takes Rose by the hands, dancing with her. Sharon’s a fun drunk, no doubt about it. Rose can’t help herself. Loosens up a little, joining in. Sharon climbs onto her chair, then ONTO THE BAR, gestures for Rose to join. Rose wags her finger. Too far. The Bikers CHEER as Sharon makes a spectacle, line- dancing down the bar, stepping over everyone’s beers, an impromptu performance... She gets all the way to the end and does a KICK AND SPIN for a BIG FINISH. Except, she loses her footing on the turn, SLIPS, TUMBLES OFF THE EDGE, BUSTING HER HEAD on the back of a barstool.
S: EXT. SHARON’S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: A tiny sagging pre-fab home. Sharon’s EYEBROW is busted open, blood dripping through her eye make-up. Rose lugs her to the front door. She’s hammered, can barely walk, practically dead weight.
S: INT. SHARON’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Rose gets her inside, dumps her onto her couch, pulls her HIGH HEELS off. Then goes into the kitchen, gets a WET WASH CLOTH, GLASS of WATER, some ASPIRIN. Rose dabs the wound with the washcloth, places the WATER and ASPIRIN on the coffee table. Revision 7.
S: EXT. LOUISVILLE - MORNING
N: The blinding sun. Hotter then hell. Everyone’s lawn burnt to a crisp in the summer heat.
S: INT. SHARON’S HOUSE - SAME
N: Light streams through the windows, baking the living room like an oven. Sharon peels open an eye. Very weakly lifts a hand to her head... it’s POUNDING. She feels her insides beginning to CHURN. Suddenly, she can feel it: Everything about to come up. She wills herself to her feet, rushes to--
S: INT. SHARON’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Sharon lunges to the toilet, throws the lid up, hurls the contents of her stomach. She flushes, stumbles over to the sink, cranes her head under the faucet to rinse out her mouth. Then catches her reflection for the first time: Face CRUSTED WITH BLOOD, a JAGGED WOUND scabbing above her eyebrow, mascara everywhere. A hazy memory of the night returns. Then with it, a wave of shame. She presses her eyes shut, embarrassed.
S: INT. SHARON’S LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
N: Sharon sits in a chair, holding the WATER Rose left for her. The room is excruciatingly quiet. A FEELING comes. It’s one she knows well. An EMPTINESS forming in the center of her, swallowing the rest of her into it... It gets stronger and stronger, until finally, she bursts to her feet, grabs her CAR KEYS. Revision 8.
S: INT. LIQUOR/CONVENIENCE STORE - A LITTLE LATER
N: Sharon pulls a 6-PACK OF BEER out of the FRIDGE CASE. RELIEF comes the second it’s in her hands. She gets in line at the REGISTER. There’s an OLD MAN in line in front of her, taking forever. She heaves a sigh, impatient. Glances over at the NEWPAPER RACK. Perusing the headlines of The NY Times, The Wall Street Journal. Then, in the upper left corner of the LOCAL LOUISVILLE PAPER, something catches her eye-- A PHOTO OF A LITTLE GIRL. Bright sparkling eyes. A sweet, tiny smile. Something in her face instantly seizes Sharon’s heart. Then she reads the headline above her image: 4-YEAR-OLD GIRL LOSES MOTHER, IN FIGHT FOR HER OWN LIFE She narrows her eyes, leans in, begins to read more. Michelle Schmitt’s mother, Teresa Schmitt, died late Thursday evening after battling a rare condition called Wegener’s disease for several months. Now the family fears Michelle will be next.
C: CLERK
D: Ma’am?
N: Sharon looks up, sees it’s her turn in line. But she’s not done reading the article, and something in her needs to know the rest. She grabs the PAPER, puts it down on the counter with the 6-pack.
S: INT. SHARON’S CAR - A LITTLE LATER
N: Sharon sits in her PARKED CAR. Cracks open a BEER, picks up the newspaper, keeps reading where she left off. 4-year-old Michelle was recently diagnosed with Biliary Atresia, a rare medical condition for which there is no cure. Without a liver transplant, doctors estimate she has approximately a year to live. (CONTINUED) Revision 9. CONTINUED: Finding a donor for young children is an uncertain process, with wait times often averaging 2.5 years. Sharon unfolds the paper and sees TWO MORE PICTURES below the crease -- The Schmitt family gathered together in front of a Christmas Tree, and a PHOTO of Teresa laughing as Michelle puts eyeshadow on her. At the bottom of the article, an announcement-- Funeral services for Teresa Schmitt will take place at Hopewell Methodist Church, Saturday Aug 18th, at 2:00pm. Sharon pauses a moment, realizing that’s today. She glances at the car’s clock: 1:51pm. Hopewell Church is not far away. Suddenly, she feels an impulse to do something completely out of the ordinary.
S: EXT. HOPEWELL CHURCH - A LITTLE LATER
N: GUESTS mill around quietly before the service, hugging and offering condolences. Ed makes his way through the sanctuary, holding Michelle and Ashley by hand. He wears his one rarely-worn suit and tie. His body here, but his mind is still far away. They take a seat in the FIRST PEW next to his parents. Barbara squeezes his arm. Ed Sr. gives him a little pat. Michelle climbs on his lap, peering around the church, looking for something.
C: MICHELLE
D: Where’s Mommy? Grandma said she’d be here.
E: whispering
N: Ed isn’t sure what to say. Barbara cuts in, pointing to the casket.
C: BARBARA
D: She’s right in there, honey.
N: Michelle looks at the closed casket, confused. (CONTINUED) Revision 10. CONTINUED:
C: MICHELLE
D: But...how can she breathe in there.
C: ASHLEY
D: You don’t breathe when you die, I told you that, dummy.
C: ED
D: Ashley, shhh, be nice.
N: Ashley is dealing with the loss by pretending she’s grown up, and knows everything her little sister doesn’t.
C: BARBARA
D: That’s her body, sweetheart, not her soul. Her soul is home with God now.
C: MICHELLE
D: But why doesn’t God want her home with us?
N: Good question. Ed’s been wondering the same thing. Barbara isn’t sure how to answer that, decides to go with a stock platitude.
C: BARBARA
D: Well...some things, only He understands.
N: MINISTER THOMAS (60’s) approaches the podium. The whispering quiets down and everyone faces front.
C: MINISTER THOMAS
D: Good afternoon and welcome. Before we get started today, I want to thank you on the behalf of the Schmitt Family for the outpouring of love, support, prayers--
S: EXT. HOPEWELL CHURCH - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
N: Sharon climbs out of her car, holding a SMALL CHEAP BOUQUET OF FLOWERS she quickly grabbed from the GROCERY STORE. She smoothes her clothes a little, still in last night’s outfit. Not exactly funeral attire: A sparkly BEDAZZLED
T: JEAN SKIRT and LOW-CUT TOP.
N: (CONTINUED) Revision 11. CONTINUED: She yanks the skirt as low as it will go, suddenly self- conscious about how short it is.
S: INT. HOPEWELL CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
N: Sharon walks in, sees the service has already started. She feels a sudden rush of nerves, still not sure what she’s even doing here. But pushes past it, tip-toeing into the sanctuary, trying to be inconspicuous. The CLICK-CLACK of her HEELS echoes anyway, making SEVERAL PEOPLE turn around. Some of them eyeball her attire. Sharon smiles apologetically, slips into a pew.
C: MINISTER THOMAS
D: Today, with the loss of Teresa, we feel real heartache. But in times like these, the Lord asks us to put our faith in Him.
N: The minister turns his gaze towards Ed.
C: MINISTER THOMAS
D: Ed Schmitt has been a man of faith all his life...
N: Heads turn towards Ed. Salt of the earth in every way.
C: MINISTER THOMAS
D: Quiet, humble, never making a show of it. But here at church every Sunday as long as I’ve known him. Ed & Teresa, married in this very room, their two precious girls baptized just steps from where I stand... So, let us trust that the Lord will see the Schmitt family through this difficult time...
N: Ed pulls in a breath, trying to steady himself.
S: INT. HOPEWELL CHURCH - RECEPTION ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: GUESTS file past the FOOD TABLE. Sharon spoons a clump of HOMEMADE NOODLE SALAD on a paper plate, still feeling out of place here. (CONTINUED) Revision 12. CONTINUED: She stands awkwardly by a potted plant, eating it. She spots Ed and the girls across the room, surrounded by people offering condolences. Waits for an opening. When a few people clear, she dumps the noodle salad, approaches them with the flowers.
C: SHARON
D: Uh... hi...I hope I’m not intruding.
N: Ed looks over at Sharon.
C: SHARON
D: You don’t know me, I’m Sharon, I read about your family in the paper and I...I just wanted to come by to say, I’m sorry.
C: ED
D: Oh. Thank you...
N: Sharon hands Ed the CHEAP BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.
C: ED
D: That’s very nice of you.
N: Michelle points to Sharon’s skirt, amazed.
C: MICHELLE
D: Your skirt sparkles!
C: SHARON
D: Oh. Uh...
N: She laughs, a little embarrassed to have attention called to it.
C: MICHELLE
D: I wish my dress sparkled. Look how it spins!
N: Michelle TWIRLS, showing her how the dress catches the air and puffs like a balloon. Sharon grins.
C: SHARON
D: Wow!
C: ED
D: This is Michelle, and this is Ashley.
N: (CONTINUED) Revision 13. CONTINUED: (2) Michelle grins. Ashley just looks at her, unsmiling. Slow to warm up.
C: MICHELLE
D: I’m 4 years old almost 5!
C: SHARON
D: Wow! And you’re...let me guess... about 12?
E: to Ashley
C: ASHLEY
D: I’m only 8!
E: shocked, flattered
C: SHARON
D: Only 8?!
N: Sharon plays up her surprise. Ashley instantly loosens, liking this lady.
T: Barbara cuts in.
C: BARBARA
D: Ed...Teresas’ Great Aunt and Uncle want just a minute with you.
N: Barbara gestures towards AUNT LOIS & UNCLE AL (80’s), her with pillow white hair, him in suspenders.
C: BARBARA
D: Sorry to interrupt. I don’t think we’ve met, were you a friend of Teresa’s?
E: to Sharon
C: SHARON
D: Oh, no. I...just sort of... wandered in off the street...
N: Sharon laughs at the absurdity of the truth. Barbara gets a load of her, isn’t sure how she feels about someone funeral-crashing her daughter-in-law’s service.
C: BARBARA
D: Ah...huh.
N: Sharon senses the weirdness. Clears her throat.
C: SHARON
D: Well... I should shove off now, but I’ll be thinking of y’all...
N: (CONTINUED) Revision 14. CONTINUED: (3) Barbara smiles politely, waves goodbye. Sharon makes her way to the exit. MEANWHILE-- AUNT LOIS has her hand on Ed’s arm--
C: LOIS
D: Faith the size of a mustard seed. That’s all you need, son.
N: She pats him reassuringly, then UNCLE AL steps up, hugging him.
C: UNCLE AL
D: We put Michelle on the prayer list at our church in Arlington. We know Jesus will get you and them girls through.
N: Ed nods and smiles, a rote routine now. More RELATIVES gather, a whole line of them.
C: ANOTHER RELATIVE
D: We keep praying for little Michelle and know God is--
N: Ed begins to TUNE OUT COMPLETELY, politely nodding and smiling, but hearing absolutely nothing.
S: INT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Sharon walks to her car, still a bit weirded-out by her decision to come here on the fly. She follows behind TWO WOMEN, talking on their way to their own car.
C: WOMAN 1
D: I don’t know how he’s doing it.
C: WOMAN 2
D: You’re tellin’ me.
C: WOMAN 1
D: The grief is enough, but then all those hospital bills too, and no insurance...
C: WOMAN 2
D: I thought the church helped him out...?
N: (CONTINUED) Revision 15. CONTINUED:
C: WOMAN 1
D: They did. Emptied the till. Bunch of friends and family went broke helping out too... But now Michelle’s surgery is another 200,000 at least...if she can even get it.
C: WOMAN 2
D: How’s anybody supposed to come up with money like that?
C: WOMAN 1
D: Gonna take a miracle.
C: WOMAN 2
D: 200,000 miracles...
E: shakes her head
N: The women break off to get in their car. Sharon pauses for a moment before she gets into her own car, thinking.
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: The house is quiet. The kids in bed. The FAINT BUZZ of the TV in the living room where Ed Senior watches an old episode of MASH. Barbara washes dishes at the sink, glances out the window at Ed, sitting alone on the back steps, smoking a cigarette.
S: EXT. ED'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: Ed stares into the darkness, thinking. Behind him, the screen door swings open. Barbara steps out onto the porch, taking a seat next to him.
C: BARBARA
D: Mind?
N: He shakes his head. They both stare into the darkness. Ed takes another drag off his cigarette. Barbara watches the smoke exit his lungs into the warm night air.
C: BARBARA
D: I really wish you wouldn’t smoke...
N: Ed looks at her. (CONTINUED) Revision 16. CONTINUED:
C: BARBARA
D: I know. This isn’t the time to get on your case about it, but those girls are gonna need their dad around, Ed...
C: ED
D: Ma...
C: BARBARA
D: See ‘em graduate, walk ‘em down the aisle. And you gotta be in good shape if you’re gonna live that long.
C: ED
D: I know, Ma.
C: BARBARA
D: You’re already 42 and you’re--
C: ED
D: Okay, I get it, Ma, enough!
N: Barbara stops abruptly. Ed closes his eyes, heaves a sigh, feeling bad for raising his voice.
C: ED
D: Sorry... I’m sorry. You’re right. You’re right, I just...gotta have a break sometimes.
N: Beat.
C: BARBARA
D: You’re a good man, Ed. Ever since you were little, always tried to do the right things.
N: He isn’t sure what to say to that. Barbara looks off, recalling a memory.
C: BARBARA
D: I’ll never forget when you were 6 and we’d gone out to Myrtle beach, spent the weekend so you could see the ocean. On the car ride back, you realized you accidentally took another boy’s sand toy with us... You felt so bad. Wouldn’t rest until we turned around and drove all the back to give it to him...
N: (CONTINUED) Revision 17. CONTINUED: (2) She looks at her son. Of all people, he doesn’t deserve this. Ed shakes his head, wrestling with something inside himself.
C: ED
D: I don’t know...
C: BARBARA
D: You don’t know what...
C: ED
D: Any of it... What any of it matters...
N: There’s a long silence between them. Barbara can tell how much is weighing on him. She offers carefully--
C: BARBARA
D: I talked with Pa last night... I think you and the kids should move in with us. We’ll make it comfortable for you, it’ll be tight, but we can make it work. Get this mortgage off your back, free up your paycheck to save for Michelle...
C: ED
D: I don’t wanna sell the house.
C: BARBARA
D: I know you don’t.
C: ED
D: Teresa worked so hard on this house. To make it nice for the girls.
N: Ed looks around their backyard at the tiny SECOND HAND SWING-SET, the LITTLE PLASTIC SWIMMING POOL Teresa found.
C: ED
D: I don’t want to take that away from them, the only thing they have left of their mom. I don’t know how to hang on to it, but I’ve gotta find a way...
N: Barbara nods, understanding. (CONTINUED) Revision 18. CONTINUED: (3)
C: BARBARA
D: Well...think about it...
S: INT. INCH BY INCH HAIR SALON - DAY
N: A small shop jointly owned by Sharon and Rose. They’re the only two hairdressers, plus an ASSISTANT in training, JASON (20’s), a sweet latino kid with a mohawk. Sharon and Rose talk while Rose’s client sits under the dryer, and Sharon waits on her next haircut to arrive.
C: SHARON
D: I don’t know what came over me, but when I saw that little girl’s picture, something inside me said, you have to go there.
C: ROSE
D: To a lady-you’ve-never-met’s funeral.
C: SHARON
D: I know it sounds crazy. The whole time I was there, I kept thinkin’, why the hell am I doing this, this is nuts.
N: Rose nods, agreeing completely.
C: SHARON
D: But then, I’m walking back to my car, and I overhear these ladies talking--
C: ROSE
D: Uh huh--
C: SHARON
D: --and I hear them say the family’s gone broke paying all these hospital bills, and now they gotta come up with another two hundred thousand for Michelle’s transplant too--
C: ROSE
D: Of course--
C: SHARON
D: --and that’s when it hit me.
N: (CONTINUED) Revision 19. CONTINUED: Sharon looks Rose right in the eye.
C: SHARON
D: Maybe, I went to the funeral because I’m supposed to give them that money.
N: Beat.
C: ROSE
D: Two hundred thousand dollars.
N: Sharon nods. Rose just stares blankly at her.
C: ROSE
D: You’ve got 200,000 dollars lying around, and I’m buying your ass drinks?
C: SHARON
D: I don’t mean give em the money from me. I mean, you know, find it. Get it somehow.
C: ROSE
D: Get 200,000 dollars. Just get it.
C: SHARON
D: Listen, I know how it sounds--
C: ROSE
D: Like you knocked a few screws loose when you bumped your head the other night.
C: SHARON
D: I know, but I’m dead serious, Rose. I think I’m meant to help that little girl. And also... I’m gonna stop drinkin’.
E: meaning this
N: Rose looks at her to see if she’s for real. Hopes she is.
C: ROSE
D: Well the stoppin’-drinkin’ I can get behind.
C: SHARON
D: I know. I’ve needed to. I can’t keep going on like this...
N: Rose can tell Sharon’s serious. Wants to encourage it. (CONTINUED) Revision 20. CONTINUED: (2)
C: ROSE
D: Look, it’s a nice idea, helping those people out...
E: softening
N: She doesn’t think she’ll pull it off, but--
C: ROSE
D: It’s a nice idea...
C: SHARON
D: Don’t know how I’ll do it yet.
C: ROSE
D: Well, keep thinkin’. Hey, maybe you’ll find a few hundred for me too, huh? And Jason, workin’ so hard, sweepin’ up all these hairballs in here...
N: Rose gestures to Jason.
C: JASON
D: Oh, uh, that’s okay.
N: Rose goes to the DRYER to check her client’s color. The door CHIMES, Sharon’s next haircut walking in.
S: EXT. WOODBRIDGE HOUSE, UPPER CLASS SUBURB - DAY
N: 28 A PRETTY TWO-STORY HOME with a wide manicured lawn, and 28 beautiful landscaping. Ed works out front, digging a LONG SHALLOW TRENCH in the grass, sweating in the blistering heat, losing himself in the hard labor. LATER -- Ed is on his hands and knees, piecing together pipes for a NEW SPRINKLER SYSTEM. LATER-- Ed lays NEW SOD where he dug up the grass. LATER-- Ed, caked in dirt and dried sweat, accepts a CHECK from the HOMEOWNER (50’s), wealthy, crisp golf shirt. Ed nods gratefully, slips the check into his wallet as he heads down to truck. Just as he’s about to climb in, THREE HUGE CONSTRUCTION TRUCKS rumble past, kicking up a cloud of ROAD DUST. Ed shields his face, trying not to breathe it in. Revision 21.
S: INT. ED’S TRUCK - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Ed drives home. With the day’s work done, reality returns, and again his thoughts begin to churn. He turns onto THE MAIN HIGHWAY, and sees he is BEHIND THE BIG CONSTRUCTION TRUCKS. They’re going 15 mph. He drums the steering wheel, impatient. Finally, they all TURN LEFT into a CONSTRUCTION ZONE. It’s the beginning of a NEW TRACT HOME DEVELOPMENT. He doesn’t think much of it, keeps driving. Then, a few seconds later... an IDEA comes. The wheels in his head turn. Suddenly, he punches the breaks, flips a U-turn, goes back to the construction site. He pulls up, takes a look at the BANNER strung up on the chain-link fence: Soon-to-be GORGEOUS HOMES with BIG BEAUTIFUL YARDS. It’s all mostly still DIRT, the new foundations being poured.
S: INT. ED’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME
N: Michelle and Ashley are watching TV. Barbara enters with a SYRINGE.
C: BARBARA
D: Alright, here we go, brave girl. Just the tiniest bee-sting.
N: Michelle holds out her arm, knowing the drill.
C: BARBARA
D: Real quick, 1-2-3.
E: readying the shot
N: Barbara administers it as quick as she can. Michelle sucks in her breath. It hurts.
C: MICHELLE
D: Ehhhhhh.
N: She fights back tears, trying to be brave. (CONTINUED) Revision 22. CONTINUED:
C: BARBARA
D: Breathe, breathe, the sting’ll be gone in a sec.
N: Michelle breathes out the pain, successfully stops herself from crying.
C: BARBARA
D: Goooood. So brave! Toughest girl in the world!
N: Ashley watches, a little jealous of all the attention Michelle is getting.
C: BARBARA
D: Ashley, clean up your toys and help me set the table. Dinner’s almost ready.
N: Ashley rolls her eyes begrudgingly.
C: ASHLEY
D: You always make me do the boring stuff.
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
N: Barbara carries a HOT CASSEROLE and BASKET OF DINNER ROLLS to the table just as Ed walks through the door from work. Ed Senior and the girls just taking their seats.
C: BARBARA
D: Perfect timing...
N: Ed enters, puts down his stuff.
C: ED
D: Hey. Sorry I’m late. I’ll shower quick.
C: BARBARA
D: No, just eat while it’s hot, we don’t mind, do we?
N: Ed senior waves off the need for any manners. Ed goes to the kitchen, washing his hands and face in the sink. Ashley notices something on the TV in the other room.
C: ASHLEY
D: Star Search is on, can we eat at the TV?
N: (CONTINUED) Revision 23. CONTINUED:
C: MICHELLE
D: Oh yeah! Can we? Please!
N: Barbara looks at Ed to make the decision. He dries his face with a dish towel.
C: ED
D: Go ‘head.
N: They hurry and take their plates into the other room. Barbara serves Ed up some food.
C: ED

N: (CONTINUED) Revision 52. CONTINUED:
C: ED
D: What do you mean?

D: Guess Sharon has a reputation... Drinkin’ too much, gettin’ into all kinds of things... There’s a rumor she got pregnant back in her 20’s but still wouldn’t slow down... gave birth to that baby and it never took a single breath.
N: Barbara shakes her head at the tragedy of it.
C: BARBARA
D: Anyway...good for her for trying to change her ways. God never gives up on anyone, I’ll tell you what.

C: ROSE
D: What?

N: Rose pauses, looks over at Sharon. Can see she’s not joking, really means that.
C: ROSE
D: Honey... I...

D: Can Daddy take us instead? Or grandaddy?
C: BARBARA
D: Granddaddy’s at the store, and your dad’s working late again, said he’d try but don’t count on it.

D: Rose! The secretaries! That’s it!
C: ROSE

(CONTINUED) Revision 78. CONTINUED:
C: ED
D: That load was hot, it’s going off too fast. Add some water.

C: ED
D: ‘scuse me?
C: ED’S NEIGHBOR

S: EXT. ED’S NEIGHBORHOOD - A LITTLE LATER

C: ED
D: What’s happening? What is this?
N: Barbara shushes him to be quiet for the crew.
C: BARBARA
D: Sharon called the news. Thinks the more people who know about Michelle, we can raise the money for her surgery...
N: Sharon looks over at Ed, holding up a pair of CROSSED FINGERS that her idea will work out. Ed is seething. AMY CHAN (30’s), reporter for the local radio news station, suddenly realizes who he is.
C: AMY CHAN
D: Wait, this is the father? I’m Amy Chan from KPPI radio. Can I ask you a few questions as well?
E: to Ed
N: The OTHER REPORTERS overhear this, and begin to DESCEND ON ED. He backs away, inundated, not liking this at all.

D: There you are.

C: BOB GREEN
D: The load went off before they got through the finish.
N: Ed’s eyes fall shut. Exactly what he was trying to make sure wouldn’t happen.
C: BOB GREEN
D: We’ve gotta jackhammer them both out and re-pour.
N: A colossal mistake. Huge.
C: BOB GREEN
D: Dammit, Ed.
C: ED
D: Bob, I’ll make it right.
C: BOB GREEN
D: No. We’ll pay you for what you’ve done, but we can’t use you on the rest of the project.
C: ED
D: Bob, wait--
C: BOB GREEN
D: No, look, I know you got a lot of personal stuff going on, and I don’t wish on anybody what your family’s going through... But this job is obviously a little too much for you to chew. I’ll have accounting tie up the loose ends.
N: Bob walks away. Ed stands there, gut-punched.
S: INT. THE GIRLS ROOM - EVENING
N: Michelle is asleep in her bed, tuckered out from the big day with news crews. (CONTINUED) Revision 81. CONTINUED: Sharon adjusts her pillow a bit, makes sure all her machines are working as they should. Then softly closes the door, goes out to--
S: INT. ED’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: As she comes down the hall, Ed comes through the front door.
C: SHARON
D: Hey... Michelle just fell asleep, your mama took Ashley for ice- cream.
N: Ed doesn’t say anything.
C: SHARON
D: Interview aired an hour ago. Amy, the reporter from the station called me, and you won’t believe it -- almost three hundred thousand dollars in donations already in, and they keep comin’. Michelle’s surgery’ll be covered, plus her care for a long time...
N: Sharon can’t believe the outpouring of generosity. It’s incredible news. Ed quietly nods, then turns, looking her right in the eye, furious.
C: ED
D: Mind telling me something, Sharon.
N: Sharon is thrown by his tone.
C: SHARON
D: Um...
C: ED
D: I don’t care if you mind. This is my house. Mine. And you think you got the right, coming in here, to my house, with my girls, acting like you own the goddamn place?
N: Sharon doesn’t know what to say. (CONTINUED) Revision 82. CONTINUED:
C: ED
D: News crews here without even asking me, Michelle’s face spread all over the TV?!
C: SHARON
D: Ed, I’m sorry, I thought you’d--
C: ED
D: YOU THOUGHT WRONG. So lemme set it real straight for you.
N: He gets in her face, boiling over.
C: ED
D: You are not welcome here in this house, Sharon. You aren’t those girls’ mother, you aren’t our family, you aren’t anybody. You got the whole town fooled thinkin’ you’re such a hero, doing all this for a poor little girl. You aren’t doing this for her, you’re doing it for you. Wanna feel better you drank your own kid to death so now you’re trying to save mine. Well, she ain’t your free ride to redemption. Go find another sob story to leech onto.
N: Sharon is frozen. Can’t speak, tears gathering in her eyes. She quickly gathers up her stuff to leave. Ed watches her go.
S: EXT. ED’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Sharon rushes to her CAR, tears falling down her face now. She gets in, slams the door, starts the engine.
S: INT. SHARON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: She’s about to drive off but looks over to see: The PURSE she made for Ashley, on her passenger seat, accidentally left there during an outing. If she’s never going to see them again, she has to give it back. She grabs it off the seat, gets out of the car-- Revision 83.
S: INT. ED’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Ed turns around to Sharon coming back up the driveway.
C: SHARON
D: Ashley left it.
N: She sets the purse down, about to turn and leave again, but then--
C: SHARON
D: You know Ed, I’m not proud of who I am. I’ve been a drunk so much of my life, I don’t know where half of it went.
N: Ed turns around to face her.
C: SHARON
D: I’m sorry if I hurt you or those girls or anybody, ‘cause I swear all I ever wanted to do was make it easier, even a little.
N: She pauses, finding these next difficult words...
C: SHARON
D: And you’re right...I did. I stole my own baby’s life away from her. But it wasn’t from drinkin’, or any of that...
N: She’s never said this out loud, doesn’t know if she can bring herself to...
C: SHARON
D: I didn’t want her.
N: She shakes her head at what an awful thing that is to say.
C: SHARON
D: I spent everyday for nine months wishing she wasn’t there. I didn’t want her. To raise a child. I felt like a child myself.
N: All of the conflicting feelings come back.
C: SHARON
D: And then... 8 days before she was due, Halloween day...she gave me my wish.
E: MORE
N: (CONTINUED) Revision 84.
C: CONTINUED: SHARON
D: And when I saw her...I knew. She could feel it, the whole time...her own mama didn’t want her... How do you start a life like that...?
E: CONT'D
N: The thought of it still wrecks her.
C: SHARON
D: I’ll never forgive myself for that... And not even your daughter livin’ can fix it.
N: Ed is quiet. Even through the haze of his own emotions, he sees she is stating a central truth.
C: SHARON
D: My life has gotten better because your girls are in it, because of helping ya’ll. Coming here, to this house, every corner of it made by a mama in love with her baby girls. But if that’s why I did all this... well, that ain’t right. It ain’t right.
E: meaning it
N: Sharon wipes her eyes. Genuinely scared she’s just broken enough for that to be true. She quietly exhales. Then turns, and walks out. Ed stands there alone for a moment, hearing the silence in the room.

D: Definitely starting to come down.
N: He goes to the BACKDOOR, gestures to Ashley and Michelle, PLAYING IN THE BACKYARD SNOW. Michelle looks skinnier, paler. She still has her spunk, but the disease is taking its toll.
C: ED
D: Come on in girls. The wind’s picking up. Time for lunch. Grammy and Granddaddy are here.
N: The girls shuffle in as Barbara is putting away food.
C: BARBARA
D: What do you feel like, I got Mac N Cheese, chicken-fries, whole lotta tuna cans...
C: MICHELLE
D: Ooh can we have Mickey pancakes?
C: BARBARA

S: EXT. LOUISVILLE - AN HOUR LATER
N: Snow barrels in from all directions. Officially BLIZZARD conditions.
S: EXT. ED’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

C: FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR
D: Officials are calling it the worst blizzard in state history. 42,000 homes without power, half of the interstates closed, and all inbound and outbound flights grounded.

C: BARBARA
D: Hello? Oh, yes, hi Dr. Ghorbani. It’s Barbara. Go on...
E: beat beat
N: (CONTINUED) Revision 87. CONTINUED: As Barbara listens, her expression slowly begins to fall. She looks as if her legs might crumble underneath her. Finally...
C: BARBARA
D: Thank you.
E: quietly
N: She hangs up the phone, just stands there, staring out the window at the ROARING STORM, paralyzed with emotion. Ed walks into the kitchen, notices the state she’s in.
C: ED
D: What’s wrong? Who was that?
N: Barbara just shakes her head. Can’t bear to say it.
C: ED
D: Ma...?
N: Ed Senior walks in, concerned now too. Barbara finally looks over at both of them, musters the words...
C: BARBARA
D: They’ve got the liver. On the one day we can’t get to it.
N: Ed and his father are frozen as they process this unimaginably bad luck. Barbara’s eyes suddenly pool with tears. Her faith can’t hold her up anymore. Not through this.
C: BARBARA
D: It’s not fair. It’s just cruel.
E: breaking
N: The girls look over, notice her getting upset.
C: MICHELLE
D: Grammy? What’s wrong?
N: Barbara realizes they’re watching, and hurries into the other room so they won’t see her fall apart. Ed and his father exchange a look. Neither has any words. Ed heads down the hall, into-- Revision 88.
S: INT. ED’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: He opens the door, finds Barbara facing a corner in the far side of the room, quietly sobbing. He goes to her side.
C: ED
D: Ma...

C: BARBARA
D: I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
C: ED
D: No, Ma...
N: He pulls her close.
C: BARBARA
D: What do we do...
C: ED
D: We find some way.
C: BARBARA
D: But what way? How?
C: ED
D: I don’t know...
N: That’s the problem. Barbara sighs, utterly defeated. Ed looks down, centering himself. Then--
C: ED
D: Look. I told Teresa I’d take care of our girls. I’m not gonna let her down.
N: Barbara can see the conviction in his eyes.
C: ED
D: We’ll find a way.
N: And for the first time, it’s his hope buoying her.
S: INT. SHARON’S HOUSE - DAY

D: Hello, it’s Sharon.
C: ED
D: Sharon, it’s Ed...
N: Sharon pauses, not expecting to hear his voice on the other end of the line.
C: SHARON
D: Oh... hi, Ed...
C: ED
D: Look, I’m gonna cut to the chase because there isn’t much time. I owe you an apology. A big one. These past few months, you kept my family afloat, and it shoulda made me grateful, but instead it tore me up I couldn’t do it myself... I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve what I said to you. Truth is, I don’t even wanna think about where we’d be if you hadn’t come along to help...
N: She can feel his sincerity.
C: ED
D: And, well, right now... I need your help again, this time more than ever.
N: Sharon sits up straighter, listening.
C: ED
D: Michelle’s gotta be in Omaha in less than 6 hours. Half the roads are closed, the airport is shut down, and all the airplanes are grounded.

D: Today’s the day. We gotta get it done.
N: (CONTINUED) Revision 90. CONTINUED: (2) Instantly, her unshakable determination takes over.
C: SHARON
D: Have her bags packed. I’ll call you back.
N: She hangs up, her brain hitting warp speed. Ed puts the receiver back, goes to the HALL CLOSET to get the SUITCASE out. Barbara and Ed Senior exchange a look, no idea how they’ll pull this off.
S: INT. ROSE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
N: Rose pre-heats the oven, dumps a bunch of FROZEN TATER TOTS onto a pan. A BUNCH OF HER FAMILY MEMBERS, including MARCUS and KELVIN, have gathered at her house to ride out the storm. They’re a LOUD GROUP, talking and laughing as they play a game of UNO. Her PHONE rings.

Their eyes LOCK for a beat. His, expressing bottomless gratitude no words can convey. Hers, expressing the honor of a thousand lifetimes. Ed turns and climbs into the helicopter. It LIFTS OFF, soaring away through the snowy sky... The image getting lighter and lighter, until it has FADED up to.. A PERFECTLY WHITE SCREEN. And for a moment, everything STILL. SILENT. Then... a SOUND. Barely audible, but unmistakable nonetheless... A slow exhale. And with it, the weight of the world, released. THE END END TILE CARDS & PHOTOS: The transplant was performed successfully just in time. In 2014, Michelle Schmitt earned her college degree. A year later, Ed walked her down the aisle. Sharon, who never misses a family get-together, showed up in a sparkly sequined dress.
