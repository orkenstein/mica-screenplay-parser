N: The first notes of Sweet Thing by Van Morrison. Warm, gentle, easy.
T: FADE IN TO:
N: SUMMER CAMP in the CATSKILLS. Sunlit. Glorious. Ten thousand shades of green. The year is 1970. It could be any year. Summer camp might be the only thing that never changes. OPENING CREDITS begin to appear and disappear as we find... MARGARET SIMON (11), standing on a DOCK in her BATHING SUIT, spindly arms and legs, nose peeling from a sunburn, hair swept up in a jumble of bobby pins, growing out from a bob. She lets out a GOOFY REBEL-YELL and does a AWKWARD JUMP into the LAKE, arms and legs flailing. A DOZEN 11-YEAR-OLD GIRLS do their own funny lake-jumps after her, one after another, like dominos. They all come up from the water, LAUGHING. A COLLAGE OF IMAGES: The girls singing CAMP SONGS, firing and misfiring ARROWS, clopping through a stream ON HORSEBACK, whispering in BUNK BEDS, blowing out MARSHMALLOWS by a CAMPFIRE, all squeezed together with their arms around each other by a “CAMP EAGLE LAKE” SIGN. A BRIGHT LIGHT FLASHES, capturing a PHOTO of it. All of the girls grinning, carefree, unaware yet of their bodies, their crooked teeth, the dorky haircuts they’ll soon regret. KIDS. They break apart. Margaret and the other campers HUG and do stupid handshakes goodbye. She climbs aboard the NEW YORK-BOUND CAMP BUS among a LINE OF BUSES here to shuttle all the girls back to the cities they came from.
S: INT./EXT. SCHOOL BUS - SAME
N: Margaret looks out the bus window at bucolic New Hampshire, saying goodbye to the best summer of her life.
S: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - AFTERNOON
N: A labyrinth of STEAL AND CONCRETE, swarming with people. Margaret’s BUS lumbers through traffic, making a wide slow turn towards UNION SQUARE, packed with WAITING PARENTS.
S: EXT. UNION SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
N: Margaret gives more goodbye-hugs as she makes her way out of the bus, scans the sea of faces for her mom. BARBARA SIMON (30’s) -- hair frizzed from the heat, anxious to please, polite to a fault -- weaves through the crowd, brightening as she spots Margaret. She waves both hands, her fingers stained with paint, a wrist coil key chain jammed with too many keys. Margaret runs over, HUGGING her. Barbara squeezes her hard.
C: MARGARET
D: Mom!
C: BARBARA
D: Heyyy! You already got taller! How was it?
C: MARGARET
D: So good. I almost didn’t want to leave.
C: BARBARA
D: Good! Come on, let’s get your trunk, I double-parked the car, they’re already mad at me.
C: MARGARET
D: What car?
C: BARBARA
D: Oh, we bought a car.
N: They pull Margaret’s CAMP TRUNK out of the BUS’S CARGO HOLD.
C: MARGARET
D: We bought a car? What for?
C: BARBARA
D: I’ll explain later. Right over there, that blue one.
N: They awkwardly schlep the trunk over to the Simon’s new CHRYSLER NEWPORT, a humongous land-yacht idling in the road. Margaret’s Grandma, SYLVIA SIMON (60’s), coiffed red hair, a vibrant dominating force, the kind of woman to keep on your good side, climbs out of the passenger seat.
C: MARGARET
D: Grandma!
C: SYLVIA
D: There’s my girl!
N: Margaret drops the trunk, runs to hug her. Barb watches their love-fest, dragging the trunk the rest of the way herself.
C: SYLVIA
D: Oh god I missed you.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Me too! You changed your hair color?
C: SYLVIA
D: Several times. Here, welcome home gift. Read the label. Aloud.
N: Margaret reaches inside a GIFT BAG, pulls out A HAND-KNIT SWEATER, reads the LABEL.
C: MARGARET
D: “Handmade expressly for you by Grandma.” Ah, you made this?
C: SYLVIA
D: From scratch. Cashmere. I did everything but kill the goat. Anyway, tell me all about camp! Did you have the best time? Did you meet a new boyfriend?!
C: MARGARET
D: Grandma...
E: embarrassed
C: SYLVIA
D: Don’t worry, you’ll be swimming in boys soon. And let’s hope they’re Jewish!
N: Barb is hurrying to find the key to the hatch on her massive wrist coil when she overhears this, looks up at Sylvia: WTF?
C: SYLVIA
D: Never mind, I take it back! Your boyfriend can be anything. Anything at all.
E: CONT'D
N: She gives Margaret a secret look: But between you and me: Jewish. A CAR HONKS behind them, TRAFFIC stacking up.
C: GUY IN CAR
D: Let’s go lady, you can’t just stop in the road!!!
C: BARBARA
D: Going! We’re going!
N: Margaret rushes to help Barb hoist the luggage in the trunk.
C: BARBARA
D: Sorry! It’s our first car, we just bought it last week!
E: CONT'D
C: GUY IN CAR
D: Oh, is that right? Congratulations!
E: softens then lays on horn LOUDER
S: INT. SIMONS’ WALK-UP APARTMENT BUILDING - A LITTLE LATER
N: Margaret, Barb, and Sylvia carry the camp trunk up a FLIGHT OF STAIRS, each holding a corner, sweating.
C: SYLVIA
D: How many more steps? What the heck’s in here? Sand?
C: MARGARET
D: It’s ‘cause you’re at the bottom. Here.
E: switches places with her
C: BARBARA
D: Hold on, I gotta find the key.
N: Barb strains to hold her end with one hand, searching through her big wad of keys again with the free hand. Sylvia rolls her eyes, knowing this will take a while.
C: SYLVIA
D: Oh god, not with those keys again.
S: INT. SIMONS’ APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Tiny, hodge-podge, lovingly cluttered, Barb’s CANVASES and ART SUPPLIES stacked around in piles. IN THE BEDROOM, HERB SIMON (30’s), natural born salesman, can’t go anywhere without making 50 new friends -- changes out of his suit from work, bouncing in his socks to the beat of I Wonder Why by Dion and The Belmonts. He hears the FRONT DOOR swing open, and heads into THE LIVING ROOM, sees the women lumber in and drop the trunk, out of breath. He rushes over, feeling guilty.
C: HERB
D: Why didn’t you come get me for this?! Heyyyy, welcome back, Honeybunch!
N: He gives Margaret a hug, says hello to Barb and his mom.
C: HERB
D: How was it? It sounded like so much fun in your letters, you were even in the play!
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: They needed a boy and I could do the deeeeepest vooooice.
E: deep voice
C: HERB
D: Oh! Who are you, sir? What have you done with my little girl?
E: deep voice back
C: MARGARET
D: It’s still meeeee. This is acting.
E: deep voice
N: They both laugh.
C: MARGARET
D: What are those boxes for?
E: CONT'D
N: She points to SOME CARDBOARD BOXES stacked up in the corner.
C: HERB
D: We’ll get to that in a sec, let’s hear more about camp!
C: SYLVIA
D: You’re moving.
N: Margaret FREEZES. Looks at Sylvia. What? Barb and Herb exchange a look, can’t believe it.
C: HERB
D: Mom.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh my god.
C: SYLVIA
D: What, she saw the boxes, she was putting it together.
N: Margaret tries to catch up, hoping she’s hearing this wrong.
C: MARGARET
D: What! We’re moving?
N: Barbara scrambles to soften the blow.
C: BARBARA
D: Listen, we wanted you to settle in before we sprung the news, but dad got his promotion and we found this great house--
C: HERB
D: Great. Much bigger than this one, with grass and trees and kids your age--
N: Margaret is still disoriented, barely hearing them.
C: MARGARET
D: Where?
C: BARBARA
D: Well that’s the thing, we got lucky and you know how we always--
C: SYLVIA
D: New Jersey.
E: cuts to chase
N: Margaret’s eyes bug out of her head. Barb and Herb can’t believe Sylvia did it again.
C: HERB
D: Mom!
C: MARGARET
D: New Jersey?!
N: Sylvia puts her hands up, guilty.
C: SYLVIA
D: I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I’m sitting over here!
N: She puts herself in a TIME-OUT across the room. Margaret begins to spiral, retreats to a chair, trying to process this. Barb struggles to regain control of things.
C: MARGARET
D: We’re leaving New York?
C: BARBARA
D: Okay, hold on a second--
C: MARGARET
D: But why? We’re happy here, we don’t need to move.
C: HERB
D: We don’t need to, we want to.
C: MARGARET
D: I don’t. I’ll have to change schools, and leave all my friends, I won’t see Grandma anymore...
N: Sylvia helplessly mimes her commiseration.
C: BARBARA
D: That’s not true, you’ll make new friends, the schools are great, and Grandma will come visit us, won’t you Sylvia?
N: Barb looks to her mother-in-law for help.
C: SYLVIA
D: I said I’d stay out of it. But I don’t drive...
N: Barbara gives up, kneels down in front of Margaret, trying to get through. Really talk to her.
C: BARBARA
D: Look, Margaret, I know. It’s a big thing to digest, but believe me, I swear to you, it’s gonna be good. We’ll have a real house, more space, our own backyard. And listen to this:
N: She takes Margaret’s hands in hers, earnest, trying to convey what’s really at the heart of this.
C: BARBARA
D: I’m not gonna work anymore. Do you know what that means? That means I won’t be gone all the time, running to a different class every night. God, you know how bad I’ve felt about that?
E: CONT'D
N: We can see just how bad Barb’s felt. Working mother’s guilt oozing from her.
C: MARGARET
D: But you like teaching art.
C: BARBARA
D: Yeah but so what, this our opportunity, I can stay home now. I’ll be home everyday with you, we’ll have family dinners, I’ll learn to cook, get involved at your school...like your friends’ moms...
N: Barbara feels herself get a little emotional at the prospect of finally being the kind of mother she’s seen on TV.
C: HERBS
D: We promise you, Margaret. This is good. Things are only going to get better.
C: BARBARA
D: Just try to believe us, okay? Can you just try?
N: Margaret manages a nod. No other choice. Barbara draws her in for a hug. Herb joins. They embrace in a little clump. Barb looks over at Sylvia, still in time-out across the room.
C: BARBARA
D: Come on. Come over here, Sylvia.
E: CONT'D
N: Sylvia heads over, joining their hug. It’s a sweet moment.
C: SYLVIA
D: Aww honey... I’m never gonna see you again.
E: pats Margaret, emotional
C: HERB
D: Oh good lord!
N: Their HUG BREAKS APART. We stay on Margaret’s face as the adults go at it again.
S: EXT. NYC - NIGHT
N: It’s late now, the New York skyline twinkling yellow, the streets a relative quiet.
S: EXT. SIMONS’ APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME
N: We take Margaret in from outside her window. She stands near the glass, uneasy, looking out at the city she’s leaving.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - SAME
N: She peers around her room, the knot in her stomach tightening, her eyes starting to fill up.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh god... are you there God? If you are, it’s me, Margaret... I just want to say... well... first, I’ve heard a lot good things about you... Uh, so, I could use some help? Please, God, I don’t wanna move, I’ve never lived anywhere but the city, New Jersey is...I mean, look, I’m sure you’ve heard what people say about it, nobody’s ever prayed “God let me live someplace great like Hoboken!” I’m just...I’m begging you. Please just stop this move from happening.
N: She looks over at the HANDFUL OF BOXES that have already been packed for her.
C: MARGARET
D: And if you can’t do that... just somehow... make things turn out okay?
E: CONT'D
N: She lets out a deep exhale, desperately hoping somebody heard this prayer.
S: EXT. SIMONS’ APARTMENT BUILDING / STREET CORNER - MORNING
N: The CHRYSLER is packed up, idling at the curb. Sylvia and Margaret hug each other goodbye, both gutted about this.
C: SYLVIA
D: I’ll call you everyday after school. 3:30 everyday, okay?
N: Margaret nods somberly. Herb puts his arm around Sylvia, squeezing her goodbye.
C: HERB
D: We’ll call you when we get there, mom.
C: BARBARA
D: Bye, Sylvia.
E: hugging her
C: SYLVIA
D: You could’ve just said “you’re dropping in too much, cut it out,” you didn’t have move.
C: BARBARA
D: This isn’t about you, I promise.
N: Sylvia doesn’t quite believe it.
C: HERB
D: Alright, all board the Big Blue Beast!
N: They pile into the car. Herb looks back at his mother standing alone on the curb, forlorn. Feels badly. He walks over to give her one more hug.
C: HERB
D: It’s only an hour by train, mom.
E: CONT'D
C: SYLVIA
D: Yeah, just long enough to pick up a family of bedbugs.
C: HERB
D: We’ll hose you off before you come inside.
N: Herb smiles, teasing her. She rolls her eyes. He gives her little a kiss on the head, goes back to get behind the wheel. As they pull way, Margaret gives Grandma one last goodbye out the back window. Sylvia gives her an air-kiss, Margaret give one back. Sylvia stands there watching them head off to their new life without her, their car finally disappearing. She looks around at the city. For the first time, she’s alone in it.
S: EXT. FARBROOK, NEW JERSEY - DAY / VARIOUS
N: A sprawling SUPERMARKET with parking spaces galore. A GARAGE SALE, junk spread out on a lawn. Kids in bathing suits on BIKES, yelling as they chase an ICE-CREAM TRUCK.
S: EXT. MORNINGBIRD LANE - SAME
N: A tree-lined street of quaint, almost identical homes baking under the summer sun.
S: EXT. SIMONS’ HOUSE - SAME
N: The Simons’ new residence is a CHARMING BRICK 2-STORY, the shutters and front door freshly painted black.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - SAME
N: Margaret arranges LITTLE HOMEMADE CERAMIC ANIMAL FIGURINES she made with Barb, trying to build a new life for herself here. She looks around the room -- it’s filled with all the same stuff from her old room, but it doesn’t feel like home.
S: INT. SIMONS’ LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: A disaster of BOXES and PACKING PAPER. Barb finishes unpacking a CRATE OF BOOKS into a BUILT-IN BOOKSHELF, looks around the room to see what’s next. It’s overwhelming, she’s barely made a dent. She wipes away some SWEAT, SNIFFS her armpit to see if she stinks.
C: MARGARET
D: Do they smell bad?
N: Margaret comes down the stairs, catching her in the act.
C: BARBARA
D: Well I can’t say they smell good.
N: Margaret makes a face.
C: BARBARA
D: Pretty soon you’ll know the feeling...
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret raises an eyebrow, not looking forward to that.
C: BARBARA
D: We have so much stuff. I don’t even like half this stuff.
E: CONT'D
N: She pulls an OLD CRUSTY MODEL SAIL BOAT out of a box. Why did they even pack this? The DOOR BELL rings.
C: MARGARET
D: I’ll get it.
N: Margaret crosses the FOYER, opens the FRONT DOOR to find a girl in a swimsuit with her hands on her hips. This NANCY WHEELER, 11 going on 17, overflowing with confidence.
C: MARGARET
D: Hi...
E: CONT'D
C: NANCY
D: I already know your name’s Margaret and you’re in 6th grade. The real estate agent sent a sheet out on you.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh... Okay.
C: NANCY
D: I’m Nancy. I’m in 6th too. You wanna come over and go under the sprinklers with me?
E: points to her house across the street
C: MARGARET
D: Uh, I don’t know.
C: NANCY
D: You don’t know?
C: MARGARET
D: I mean I have to ask. Just a sec.
N: Margaret goes back inside to Barb.
C: MARGARET
D: There’s a girl from across the street who asked if I can run through her sprinklers.
E: CONT'D
N: Barb brightens a little, glad Margaret’s already making friends, their move working out as planned.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh. Good. Sure, fine by me.
C: MARGARET
D: I need my bathing suit.
N: Barb looks at the big mess, no clue where one would be.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh boy... Good luck finding it in here.
C: NANCY
D: It’s alright, she can borrow one of mine.
E: appearing
N: They turn to see Nancy has let herself inside.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh. Hello. Nice to meet you...
C: NANCY
D: Nancy. I live in the bigger house across the street.
N: Nancy points through the window at her better house. Barbara smiles crookedly. Interesting kid.
S: EXT. NANCY WHEELER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Nancy and Margaret head across the street. Nancy notices Margaret’s bad posture.
C: NANCY
D: You want a trick to stop slouching like that?
N: Margaret looks over, not sure what to say.
C: NANCY
D: Walk with your thumbs forward. It’s impossible to slouch when you do that, see.
E: CONT'D
N: Nancy demonstrates her forward-thumb, chest-out posture.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh...
N: Margaret tries it, walking stiffly upright next to Nancy.
C: NANCY
D: So whose class are you in at Delano?
C: MARGARET
D: The letter said “room 18”...
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 14.
C: NANCY
D: I’m in 18 too! We were supposed to have Miss Phipps, but she ran off with some guy to California, so we’re getting a new teacher now.
N: They step into--
S: INT. NANCY WHEELER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: It’s full of EXPENSIVE ORNATE FURNITURE WITH CLAWED FEET.
C: NANCY
D: Anyway, just pray for a good one. Come on, my room’s upstairs.
S: INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: POSTERS OF HEART THROBS peppered with Nancy’s lipstick kisses, a DRESSER loaded with BOTTLES OF NAIL POLISH and TANGLED COSTUME JEWELRY, a HEART-SHAPED MIRROR with “Nancy Wheeler” scrawled a million times on the glass. A stark contrast to Margaret’s patchwork childlike bedroom. * Nancy gets a BATHING SUIT out of a drawer, tosses it to Margaret.
C: NANCY
D: Here. It’s clean.
C: MARGARET
D: Thanks. Where should I change?
C: NANCY
D: What’s wrong with here?
N: Margaret pauses, a little self-conscious.
C: MARGARET
D: Nothing... I don’t mind if you don’t mind?
C: NANCY
D: Why would I mind?
C: MARGARET
D: I don’t know...
N: Margaret starts to change into the suit. Nancy sits on the edge of her bed, staring right at her as she does. Margaret turns around, carefully pretzeling herself so as not to reveal her body.
C: NANCY
D: Oh, you’re still flat.
E: laughs
N: Margaret’s cheeks flush. She yanks up the suit.
C: MARGARET
D: Not exactly, I’m just small boned.
C: NANCY
D: I’m already growing, see?
N: Nancy sticks her chest out to demonstrate.
C: NANCY
D: In a few years, I’m gonna have a pretty big chest. My mom’s are huge.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret raises an eyebrow.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh...
C: NANCY
D: I thought you’d be a lot more grown up coming from New York. Have you ever kissed a boy?
C: MARGARET
D: You mean...really kiss? Like on the lips?
C: NANCY
D: Yeah. Have you?
C: MARGARET
D: Not really...
E: beat, reluctantly
N: Nancy looks relieved.
C: NANCY
D: Neither have I... But I practice a lot. Wanna see?
N: Nancy picks up her pillow, opens her mouth wide and gives it a LONG KISS, gently stroking the pillow’s “hair” and “back”. It goes on for uncomfortably long. Margaret can’t help but laugh. Nancy frowns, embarrassed.
C: NANCY
D: You have to practice, or you won’t be a good kisser. You wanna see something else?
E: CONT'D then
N: Margaret’s not sure she does. Nancy opens a DRESSER DRAWER with a MILLION COSMETICS inside.
C: NANCY
D: It’s another one of my experiments. I put on different kinds to see how I look best so when 8th grade rolls around, I’ll be ready.
E: CONT'D
N: She runs a HAIRBRUSH through her long hair.
C: NANCY
D: Do you always wear your hair like that?
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret touches her mess of bobby pins, self-conscious.
C: MARGARET
D: It’s in an in-between stage right now. I’m trying to grow it longer so it covers my ears. They stick out a little.
C: NANCY
D: I noticed.
N: Apparently Nancy notices everything.
C: NANCY
D: Ready to go?
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Sure...
S: EXT. NANCY’S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
N: MRS. WHEELER (30’s), tan with big breasts and curled hair, WASHES a LITTLE DOG in a TUB. The girls come out with their towels.
C: NANCY
D: This is the girl who just moved from New York. Margaret Simon.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Hi Margaret. Nice to meet you. How do you like Farbook so far?
C: MARGARET
D: It’s fine...
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Tell your mother I’m looking forward to meeting her. We have a bowling team on Mondays, and a bridge game Thursday afternoons.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh...
N: Mrs. Wheeler cocks her head, waiting for more.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Oh?
C: MARGARET
D: No, I just don’t think my mom’s ever played Bridge and I don’t think she bowls either...
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Ahh. Well, tell her she can call me about carpooling to Sunday School then.
C: MARGARET
D: I don’t go to Sunday school.
N: Mrs. Wheeler stops scrubbing the dog, surprised.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: You don’t go to Sunday School?
N: Margaret feels a little put on the spot.
C: MARGARET
D: Uh...
C: NANCY
D: Lucky you.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Nancy. Please.
C: NANCY
D: Mom, she came to be with me, not you. Come on, let’s go.
E: tugs Margaret away
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: 30 minutes, no more or it drowns the grass!
E: calling after them
S: EXT. NANCY’S YARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Nancy cranks on the SPRINKLER.
C: NANCY
D: Follow the leader!
N: She dances through the water. Jumps, spins, cartwheels. Margaret copies her move for move, trying to keep up. Nancy pretends to run in sexy slow-motion like a girl from a movie.
C: NANCY
D: Look at me, I’m a model.
E: CONT'D
N: She pouts her lips, runs her fingers through her wet hair. Just then, A BIG HARD BLAST OF WATER nails her in the face.
C: NANCY
D: AAAAHHH!!!
E: CONT'D
N: Nancy’s brother EVAN (14), pudgy and freckled, holds the HOSE, laughing with his friend, MOOSE FREED (14) handsome with big brown eyes, a foot taller thanks to a recent growth spurt.
C: NANCY
D: Evan you idiot!
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Who are they?
C: NANCY
D: My stupid brother and his friend. They’re 14 and disgusting, all they think about is naked girls! Mommmmm!!!
E: screams
N: Nancy runs off to tattle. Both boys look at Margaret. She quickly grabs the TOWEL, covering herself, thinking about the naked girls comment.
C: EVAN
D: Who’re you?
C: MARGARET
D: Um...Margaret? We just moved in across the street.
C: MOOSE
D: You’re the new people? Ask your dad if he wants me to cut your lawn. Five bucks and I trim too.
C: MARGARET
D: Uh... alright.
N: She smiles, trying to seem normal.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Evan! Get over here right now!
E: O.S.
N: Evan rolls his eyes, leaving Margaret with Moose. Moose lifts up his arm to wipe some sweat, revealing a TINY TUFT OF ARMPIT HAIR. Margaret stares at it a sec. She shifts her weight, feeling nervous around him. Moose bends down, picks up the Wheeler’s FALLEN BIRD FEEDER, carefully hangs it back on its HOOK. Margaret watches, transfixed.
C: MOOSE
D: Gotta get ‘em more birdseed.
N: She nods. There’s a tiny flutter in her belly.
C: MOOSE
D: My name’s Moose Freed. Don’t forget to ask your dad about the lawn.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: I definitely won’t.
N: She grins at him. Then worries the grin is too much, tries for something more casual. It’s not great either.
S: EXT. NANCY WHEELER’S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
N: Nancy walks Margaret back home.
C: NANCY
D: Sorry you got stuck with Moose.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh. That’s okay...
N: Margaret decides she better not say how she really felt about him. They stop in front of her HOUSE.
C: NANCY
D: Anyway, listen Margaret, on the first day of school you have to wear loafers, but no socks.
C: MARGARET
D: How come?
C: NANCY
D: Because I decided I want you to join my secret club. There’s 3 of us, and I’m letting in one more. Just don’t wear socks or the other kids might not want you.
N: Margaret swallows, already feeling rejected.
C: MARGARET
D: Okay...
N: Nancy waves and skips off, leaving Margaret with that. Margaret stands there a moment, feeling her anxiety rise.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Margaret organizes her SCHOOL SUPPLIES, thinking. Then--
C: MARGARET
D: Are you there God? It’s me... Margaret again. It’s the first day of school tomorrow. Sometimes when I’m nervous, if I get my pens and pencils all facing the right direction, I feel a little better.
E: whispers
N: She looks at her METICULOUS DESK. It’s not helping at all. She gets up from the chair, starts to pace a little.
C: MARGARET
D: Also... today I met this girl Nancy. She knew about a lot of stuff, I don’t know if she liked me, I think she expected me to be older or something? Anyway....it got me thinking, maybe it’s time... you know... ...things started happening... around here...
E: CONT'D how does she put it?
N: She draws a quick little circle around her flat chest. Feels a little embarrassed putting it so bluntly to God. Then suddenly: The SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall.
C: MARGARET
D: My parents might think it’s weird we’re talking, so I’m just gonna do it without moving my lips.
E: CONT'D lowers voice
N: Barb hurries in, carrying a bunch of RANDOM JUNK in her arms, still getting through the unpacking.
C: MARGARET
D: Hey it’s me, I’m still here.
E: CONT'D V.O.
N: Barb tosses MARGARET’S BATHING SUIT onto her bed.
C: BARBARA
D: It was in with the bathroom stuff.
C: MARGARET
D: Anyway, just think about, you know, what I mentioned...
E: V.O.
N: Margaret’s eyes dart quickly at her chest again.
C: BARBARA
D: And found this if you want it.
N: Barb puts an OLD ELECTRIC PENCIL SHARPENER on her desk.
C: MARGARET
D: Thanks God. Thanks mom.
E: then
N: Barb nods, exiting again.
S: EXT. SIMON’S HOUSE - MORNING
N: MORNING LIGHT streaks across the Simons’ front lawn, GLISTENING WITH DEW. A perfect image. A DIGITAL ALARM CLOCK goes off, wrecking it a little.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER
N: BARE FEET wriggle into a PAIR OF BROWN LOAFERS. Margaret steps in front of the mirror for a look at herself. Takes a deep breath, anxious.
S: INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Barb has the kitchen almost in order, down to the last items. Herb hurries to gobble some TOAST, running late. Margaret walks in, hunched in her new blue jumper, her toes pointed self-consciously inward.
C: BARBARA
D: Heyyyy! There she is. You look great. All ready for the first day?
C: HERB
D: Look at you. A 6th grade vision in blue! Can’t wait to hear all about it.
E: kisses her head
N: Herb gives Barb a squeeze before rushing out. Barb pours Margaret some cornflakes, senses her anxiety.
C: BARBARA
D: How do you feel? You look nervous. Don’t be. Just don’t. I mean, it’s fine if you are, I still get nervous sometimes. It doesn’t go away cause you’re older. In fact, it might actually get worse...
N: Barbara realizes her pep talk is going the wrong way. Then--
C: BARBARA
D: Wait, you forgot your socks.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: I don’t want socks.
C: BARBARA
D: You do. Trust me, you’ll get blisters without them.
N: Margaret rolls her eyes a little, not in the mood to be lectured. A LAWN MOWER ENGINE starts up next door, suddenly JOGGING MARGARET’S MEMORY.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh, wait! Dad!
N: She leaps up from her seat. Barb turns around, not sure what the commotion is. Margaret runs to catch him.
S: EXT. SIMONS’ DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Herb is already in the car, backing out of the driveway.
C: MARGARET
D: Dad!
N: He sees her racing towards him, rolls down the window.
C: MARGARET
D: A boy named Moose asked if you want him to cut our grass for 5 dollars.
E: CONT'D
C: HERB
D: Tell him thanks but no thanks. Just bought a power-mower. Top of the line.
N: Shit.
C: MARGARET
D: Uh...he also trims.
C: HERB
D: Got a trimmer too. Two kinds. Might turn that shrub into a penguin. Gotta go honey, knock em dead today!
N: Herb starts to back out again. Margaret starts back towards the house, finds Barbara waiting for her in the doorway.
C: BARBARA
D: I just feel like I need to warn you one more time about the socks.
N: Margaret sighs, annoyed. Barbara puts up her hands, not wanting to be a nagging mother.
S: EXT. DELANO SCHOOL - LATER THAT MORNING
N: First day chaos. Tons of TRAFFIC and WANDERING KIDS.
S: INT. DELANO SCHOOL - SAME
N: Margaret limps up the front steps through the MAIN ENTRANCE, her sockless feet throbbing. She pulls down the heel of her shoe to see a HOT RED BLISTER FORMING. She sucks it up, puts her thumbs forward, trying to walk the way Nancy showed her. She spots ROOM 18 up ahead.
S: INT. 6TH GRADE CLASS - CONTINUOUS
N: Margaret enters, peers around for Nancy. Her eyes scan everyone’s FEET. Socks, socks, socks. Then finally: NO SOCKS. She pans to see the feet belong to Nancy.
C: NANCY
D: Hey! Over here!
N: Margaret hurries over, relieved. Nancy checks her feet.
C: NANCY
D: Good. I thought you’d forget. This is Margaret, she’s the one I told you about.
E: CONT'D then
N: GRETCHEN POTTER (11), Jewish, chubby, opinionated-- waves. JANIE LOOMIS (11), skinny, soft-spoken, African American, smiles.
C: GRETCHEN
D: So you’re the fourth.
C: JANIE
D: Nice to meet you...
C: MARGARET
D: You too...
C: NANCY
D: You’re lucky we saved you a seat, otherwise you’d be over there next to Norman Fisher.
N: NORMAN FISHER (11), ill-fitting button-down, bed-head, thick glasses with a string, sits off by himself.
C: GRETCHEN
D: Oh my god, oh my god, don’t look, Philip Leroy just walked in.
C: NANCY
D: Yessss. I was praying so hard he’d be in our class!
C: MARGARET
D: Who’s Philip Leroy?
C: NANCY
D: Take a guess.
N: Margaret looks over at a CLUSTER OF BOYS entering the room. PHILIP LEROY (11) instantly stands out, casually great- looking, sun-kissed from a summer of waterskiing.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh. Got it.
N: Philip takes a seat next to his friend, FREDDY BARNETT (11), a SHORT REDHEAD with an EXTREMELY BAD SUNBURN. Margaret notices a TALL ATTRACTIVE WOMAN entering the room.
C: MARGARET
D: Is that our teacher?
E: CONT'D
N: They all turn to look.
C: NANCY
D: Her? That’s Laura Danker! She’s in our class!
N: Margaret looks again, feeling dumb.
C: MARGARET
D: She’s in 6th grade?
N: LAURA DANKER (11), looks at least 16 thanks to her HEIGHT and HUGE EARLY BOOBS.
C: NANCY
D: Stay away from her if you’re smart. My brother says she goes behind the A&P with him and Moose and let’s them feel her up...
N: Margaret reacts to “feel her up,” not used to peers talking like this. She watches Laura take a seat by herself in the back row. A THROAT CLEARS. They turn to see their new teacher, MILES J BENEDICT (20’s) -- starched shirt, neatly combed hair. They all quiet down, sit up straighter as he walks to the front of the class.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Uh, good morning class... Um, uh, first I’d just like to introduce myself... My name is Mr. Benedict and I will be your new 6th grade teacher.
E: clears throat
N: He writes “MR. BENEDICT” on the chalkboard.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: That’s Benedict, like the eggs. And because it’s eggcellent to meet you.
E: CONT'D
N: He chuckles at his joke. They all just stare at him. He clears his throat again. Looks down at a SWEATY SCRAP OF PAPER tucked inside his palm, his INTRODUCTION speech written on it. “Benedict. Like the eggs. And because it’s egg-cellent to meet you. (Pause for laughter.)” He looks back up at their blank faces. Holds in an ocean of nervous diarrhea.
C: NANCY
D: Can you believe this guy?
E: whispers to Margaret
N: Margaret feels a little sorry for him.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Uh, now, if you’ll please complete the following sentences so we can get to know each other a little better...
N: He writes on the chalkboard: “I love...” “I hate...” “I’m looking forward to...”
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: I’ll begin. I love...that I’m finally getting to be a teacher for the first time.
E: CONT'D smiles sincerely
C: I hate...self-doubt, feeling tongue
D: tied, upset stomaches, and staring at the ceiling all night instead of sleeping at all. I’m looking forward to...the year with you. Okay, now your turn.
E: smiles again
N: They all take out paper and get busy writing. Nancy slides a NOTE to Margaret: “Secret club meeting today. 3pm, my house. NO SOCKS!!!”
C: NANCY
D: Pass it on.
N: Margaret nods dutifully, passing it to Janie.
S: INT. SYLVIA’S NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY
N: Sylvia finishes watering TWO LITTLE BAMBOO PLANTS sitting in her window sill, then sits at the kitchen table, not sure what to do next. She looks at the phone, then looks at her watch. Margaret’s not home for several hours.
S: INT. SIMONS’ HOUSE / VARIOUS - THAT AFTERNOON
N: The KITCHEN is done now. Barb finishes wiping the counters, goes into THE LIVING ROOM to see what’s left to do. Just one BIG STACK OF BOXES remain, carrying all her ART STUFF. PAINT BRUSHES, PAINTS, CANVASES, HER OLD ARTWORK. She pulls out a few of her PAINTINGS. Eyeing some of the older ones, she’s surprised by her reaction to them: She likes her own work. She’s talented. Two endorsements she always hesitates to give herself. She leans a few of them against the walls to be hung up later. Then glances around the room, trying to figure out where to put all of her art supplies. She opens the HALL CLOSET: already stuffed. Peaks in the LAUNDRY ROOM: Too small.
S: INT. SIMONS GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
N: She slides the ART BOXES into a CORNER next to a RUSTY FAN and a BOX OF YEARBOOKS. Something about putting this stuff here makes her a little sad. The end of a long-held part of herself. But she brushes off the feeling, goes back into --
S: INT. SIMONS’ LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: As Barb comes into the room, she suddenly notices something hadn’t until this moment, FROWNS. The TATTERED LIVING ROOM SET from their New York apartment has seen better days, and also looks RIDICULOUSLY SMALL in their vast new suburban den. Just comically out of proportion. Hmmm. This will definitely not work. The PHONE RINGS. Barb crosses get it.
C: BARBARA
D: Hello?
C: SYLVIA
D: Guess who.
N: INTERCUT with Sylvia at her apartment, dusting her furniture to pass the time. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 28.
C: BARBARA
D: Hello Sylvia. Margaret’s not home from school yet.
C: SYLVIA
D: It’s 3:32.
C: BARBARA
D: I know.
C: SYLVIA
D: You said she’s out at 3:15 and the walk is 10 minutes.
C: BARBARA
D: Yes, she’ll probably be here any minute.
C: SYLVIA
D: Okay... I’ll... just wait I guess.
N: A beat as Sylvia waits for the few minutes to pass. Then she realizes she should probably small-talk with Barbara.
C: SYLVIA
D: Um, so, how are you?
E: CONT'D
C: BARBARA
D: Good. I’m good. How are you?
C: SYLVIA
D: Oh fine... Today I read that when you don’t have any loved ones around your life expectancy drops drastically. But, you know, I’ve had a good run...
N: Barb can’t help but laugh at her guilt trip.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh Sylvia, come on.
E: laughing
N: Sylvia’s not kidding. The door opens behind Barb and Margaret * hurries in. *
C: BARBARA
D: Oh, here she is, she’s home. Grandma’s on the phone for you.
E: CONT'D holds out the phone
N: Margaret instantly perks up, drops her bag, runs to grab it.
C: MARGARET
D: Grandma!
C: SYLVIA
D: Honey!!! How’s New Jersey? Are you okay? You can tell me the truth.
E: lighting up
C: MARGARET
D: It’s actually not as bad as I thought...
C: SYLVIA
D: Really? That’s wonderful news...
N: Sylvia looks crestfallen, secretly hoping it’d be bad enough they’d all move back.
C: SYLVIA
D: Well, anyway, I was thinking you could come visit the weekend after next, I’ll get us tickets to a show, you can spend the night, we’ll do a little slumber party, that’d be so fun, right?
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Oooh yeah, I’d love that!
C: SYLVIA
D: I knew you would. Great. I’ll tell your mother it was your idea, okay? I’ll call you tomorrow.
N: Margaret agrees, hangs up.
C: MARGARET
D: Can I go to Nancy’s right now?
C: BARBARA
D: You just got home, I haven’t even heard about your day.
C: MARGARET
D: I know, can I?
C: BARBARA
D: Well just at least give me one word first.
C: MARGARET
D: “Eghh?”
E: thinks a beat
N: A sound indicating “I don’t know, maybe it’ll be okay, maybe it’ll be a truly hellish nightmare, we have to see.” Barbara gets her meaning.
C: BARBARA
D: Fair enough. Okay, go ahead.
N: Margaret hurries for the door.
S: INT. NANCY WHEELERS BACK PORCH - A LITTLE LATER
N: Nancy, Gretchen and Janie sit around the patio table eating Oreos, LAUGHING. Margaret arrives through the back door, wishing she weren’t the last one to get here.
C: MARGARET
D: Hi...
N: She finds a seat at the table, reticent.
C: NANCY
D: We were just talking about Laura Danker again.
C: GRETCHEN
D: Yeah, how she got even bigger over the summer.
N: Gretchen cups her hands to show the size of Laura’s chest. Margaret quickly nods in agreement, trying to catch up to where they are in the conversation.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh. Yeah, she looks so grown up...
N: Margaret crosses her legs, trying to seem cool. Her SHOE falls off. She quickly leans down and puts it back on.
C: NANCY
D: She’s worn a bra since 4th grade. I bet you a dollar she already gets her period too.
N: Margaret gets a little uncomfortable at the word “period”. Janie does too. They share a look.
C: GRETCHEN
D: Well I know for sure somebody in our school does.
C: JANIE
D: How...?
C: GRETCHEN
D: I always check the bins.
N: Margaret’s never even thought of checking the bins.
C: NANCY
D: Did you get it yet, Margaret?
N: Suddenly they’re all looking at her, waiting for a response.
C: MARGARET
D: Uh... not yet. Have you?
E: beat
C: NANCY
D: No, none of us have yet.
N: She couldn’t be more relieved. Nancy bangs her COKE CAN on the table like a gavel.
C: NANCY
D: Alright, let’s get down to business. First, this secret club is a secret. You can’t tell anyone what happens here. Ever.
E: CONT'D
C: GRETCHEN
D: Duh.
C: NANCY
D: Second, if you want to be in it, you have to follow the club’s rules.
C: JANIE
D: What kind of rules?
C: NANCY
D: I don’t know, I haven’t thought of them yet. Oh, I just got one. If you’re in the club, you have to wear a bra.
E: twiddles eyebrows
N: The energy in the room immediately shifts. Margaret crosses her arms over her non-existent chest.
C: GRETCHEN
D: I have one. If you get your period, you have to tell us about it.
C: NANCY
D: Oooh, yes. Every detail. Especially how it feels.
C: JANIE
D: Mine is... what if we all keep a notebook of the boys we like?
N: They all love that idea too.
C: MARGARET
D: Yeah, and, and we have to show it to each other at each meeting and we can’t ever lie.
E: piggy-backing
N: The room tingles with excitement at the prospect of this kind of sharing. Margaret smiles, starting to feel like part of the group. She’s at the beginning of a whole new chapter.
S: EXT. FARBROOK - EARLY EVENING
N: RAINBIRDS spray a GRASSY PARK.
S: INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - LATER
N: Herb organizes his RECORDS in a COOL RECORD STAND now that he has enough room to showcase his collection, Peggy Lee’s Fever playing, absently singing along.
C: HERB
D: Fever when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight. Feva! You know her real name was Norma? Then a guy looks at her and goes “you don’t look like a Norma, you look like a Peggy” and she goes “Okay.”
N: But Margaret’s not listening. She’s studying something, her BROW FURROWED, chewing her fingernails. REVEAL: THE JC PENNEY CATALOGUE, opened to the BRA SECTION. She has it tucked inside her HISTORY BOOK, angled so nobody but her can see it. How is she going to broach this? She looks over at her mom. Barb is in THE KITCHEN looking at a PHOTO in a RECIPE BOOK: A JUICY GOLDEN BROWN CHICKEN nestled in a clump of crispy potatoes. She looks over at HER OWN VERSION: A LIMP GRAY WATERY CARCASS floating next to BURNT BLACK POTATOES. It’s somehow both overcooked and under-cooked.
C: BARBARA
D: How is that even possible?
N: She puts a PIECE OF PARSLEY on top of it, trying to make it look more like the picture.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Margaret climbs in bed, her mind still on the bra, Barb dropping off some FOLDED LAUNDRY from a basket on her hip.
C: BARBARA
D: Turns out I don’t hate laundry, I just hated going to the laundromat. Thank you, New Jersey. Goodnight, hon. See ya in the morning.
E: walks over to kiss her
C: MARGARET
D: Um...
N: Barb looks back at her. Margaret tries to bring up the bra.
C: MARGARET
D: Yeah, g’night.
E: CONT'D chickens out
N: Barb makes her way to the door, SHUTS OFF THE LIGHT. Margaret regrets not having the guts. Just before the door closes--
C: MARGARET
D: I WANT TO GET A BRA!
E: CONT'D blurts
N: Barb freezes. Margaret covers her face, mortified. Barb turns the LIGHT BACK ON, a little dumbstruck. Unprepared for this conversation. She treads lightly.
C: BARBARA
D: Okay... Uh, you...you think you need one?
N: Margaret shoots her a mom hurt look. Barb realizes.
C: BARBARA
D: No, no, I just mean, you know, they’re kind of a pain, so no need to start sooner than you have to. But if you want one, we’ll get one.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret chews her lip, feeling so weird about this.
C: BARBARA
D: So you want one?
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Yes, I already said that!
N: She can’t stand to keep talking about it.
C: BARBARA
D: Okay, okay. We’ll get one then. We’ll get one this weekend.
N: Margaret nods, just wanting this conversation to be over.
C: BARBARA
D: Alright. Well, g’night again.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Night.
N: Barb walks out, pulls the door shut behind her, just stands there a moment, realizing she’s just entered a whole new phase of motherhood. Is she ready for it? INSIDE, Margaret still cringes.
C: MARGARET
D: So weird. So weird. That was so weird, God. Why do I feel so weird?
E: CONT'D
N: She drums her face, trying to knock the feeling out of her head.
S: EXT./INT. DELANO SCHOOL - MORNING
N: School in session, kids in class. Barb hurries inside, running a little late. Pokes her head into the PTA ROOM, making sure she’s in the right place.
S: INT. DELANO SCHOOL P.T.A ROOM - SAME
N: A FEW DOZEN WOMEN mill around.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Here for the PTA meeting?
C: BARBARA
D: Oh hi, yes, I’m Barbara Simon.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Oh! Barbara! I’m Jan Wheeler, Nancy’s mother. I met Margaret. I’ve heard a lot about you.
N: Hard to tell whether she means it in a good way.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh... great to meet you too.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: We’re just about to get started. Please, have a seat.
N: Barb finds a chair. Mrs. Wheeler gets up behind the PODIUM, quiets everyone down.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Thank you all for coming today. Delano is nothing without our dedicated parents. So, let’s dive right in and start the year like we always do, by forming our committees. First... Our Campus Improvement Committee. Any volunteers?
E: CONT'D
N: Barb RAISES HER HAND. A few other women do too. Mrs. Wheeler nods, grateful.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Thank you. Okay...Delano Social Committee. Dances, luncheons, parent-teacher night...
E: CONT'D
N: Barb RAISES HER HAND AGAIN. Why not.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Great. Restroom Sanitation Committee...
E: CONT'D
N: Nobody volunteers for that one. Barb RAISES HER HAND A 3rd TIME. Mrs. Wheeler gives her an approving little nod.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Good for you, Barbara.
E: CONT'D
N: Barb smiles, feeling good about this.
S: INT. ROOM 18 / 6TH GRADE CLASS - LATER THAT DAY
N: The class finishes a MATH WORKSHEET. A stop watch BEEPS. Mr. Benedict clicks it off.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Alright, pencils down and kindly pass your worksheets forward...
E: gathering them up MORE
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Now, uh, before the bell rings, I’d like to share some news that I think will make you all very happy.
E: CONT'D
N: The class perks up, paying attention.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Now that you’re all in 6th grade... you’ll each get to do a full, year- long research project.
E: CONT'D
N: The whole class GROANS. This is the good news?
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Wait, wait. Let me get to the good part. And these research projects will be about...anything you want. You decide. 100% your choice.
E: CONT'D
N: He waits for their expressions to brighten at the prospect of such autonomy.
C: FREDDY BARNETT
D: Are you kidding me?
N: They all complain even louder. Mr. Benedict sputters, not expecting this.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: I... uh... well...
N: Freddy flicks a PAPER FOOTBALL at him.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: What was that? Uh, please don’t do that again please?
E: CONT'D
N: THE BELL RINGS, thank god. They all pack up to leave. Mr. Benedict gestures to Margaret.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Excuse me, Margaret, may I talk to you for a moment after class?
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret looks taken aback. Did she do something wrong?
C: NANCY
D: Uh oh, what’d you do, Margaret?
E: teasing
N: Margaret swallows. Janie gives her a concerned look. As the kids clear out, Margaret approaches Mr. Benedict’s desk.
C: MARGARET
D: Hi...
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Please, have a seat.
N: She reluctantly sits. Mr. Benedict shuffles through papers.
C: MARGARET
D: Did I... do something wrong?
N: He looks up, suddenly seeing how nervous she is.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Oh! No. No-no-no-no. Sorry, did I give that impression? Rookie mistake. Please, relax. Would you like anything? Water? Candy Corn?
N: He offers her his little JAR OF CANDY CORN.
C: MARGARET
D: No...thank you.
N: Margaret loosens a little. He takes a piece of CANDY CORN for himself. She watches him chew it for a moment.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: I’m just having little chats with each student in advance of your research projects to answer questions, perhaps guide you towards a topic of your choice...
C: MARGARET
D: Oh.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: I read your getting-to-know you paper, and noticed under the “I hate” section, you wrote “religious holidays”? Which I found curious...
N: Margaret shifts in her seat, put on the spot.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: If you don’t want to share why, you don’t have to.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: No, I, uh... I guess I just don’t like those holidays because I don’t celebrate any of them...
E: MORE
C: MARGARET
D: My dad is Jewish and my mom is Christian, so instead of picking which religion I am, they just decided I wouldn’t have one, and I’ll choose when I grow up...
E: CONT'D
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Ah, I see. And have you given that much thought?
C: MARGARET
D: Not really... My grandma wants me to be Jewish...
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: And your other grandparents want you to be Christian I imagine?
C: MARGARET
D: I’ve never seen my other grandparents. They live in Ohio.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: You just talk to them on the phone.
C: MARGARET
D: No, I’ve never met them at all.
N: Mr. Benedict absorbs this with curiosity.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Interesting...
N: His curiosity begins to pique her own. That is pretty interesting now that she thinks about it.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Well, if I may suggest it, religion could make a very compelling research topic for you...
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret nods, still thinking about her grandparents.
S: EXT. SIMONS HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
N: A SALVATION ARMY TRUCK idling out front.
S: INT. SIMONS HOUSE - SAME
N: Barbara tries to wrap up a phone call with Sylvia while THE SALVATION ARMY GUYS carry out their OLD FURNITURE. Sylvia’s in her APARTMENT, standing next to a PORTRAIT OF HERSELF.
C: SYLVIA
D: Mezzanine tickets, dead center. Tell her that.
E: O.S.
C: BARBARA
D: I will.
C: SYLVIA
D: Is she excited?
E: O.S.
N: Barbara’s losing patience.
C: BARBARA
D: Yes. She’s excited.
N: One of the GUYS hands Barb the DONATION RECEIPT.
C: BARBARA
D: Really gotta go now, call you later Sylvia. Thanks.
E: CONT'D takes receipt
C: SALVATION ARMY GUY
D: God bless you.
N: Margaret walks in just as they’re leaving.
C: MARGARET
D: What happened to the couch?
C: BARBARA
D: Oh it was old and too small for the room. Time to turn a new leaf. Maybe something modern? I don’t know, I need to think about it...
N: The men exit and she closes the door, crosses to the SECRETARY DESK to file it.
C: BARBARA
D: How was school? You’re later than normal.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Fine. How come I’ve never talked to your mom or dad?
N: Barb’s posture changes, caught off guard.
C: BARBARA
D: Uh...what made you think of that?
C: MARGARET
D: Just wondering.
E: beat
N: Barb slides the receipt into a FILE FOLDER, thrown off- balance by the question.
C: MARGARET
D: I know we don’t see them because they’re far away, but why don’t we even call them?
E: CONT'D
N: Barb’s not sure how to handle this. She steadies herself, weighing it.
C: BARBARA
D: Because...we just don’t. It’s a long story.
C: MARGARET
D: What do you mean.
C: BARBARA
D: I mean I’ll tell you some other time.
C: MARGARET
D: Why can’t you just tell me now?
N: Margaret looks at her, really wanting to know. Barb can tell she’s not getting out of this.
C: BARBARA
D: Look, I just don’t want you to be burdened by anything... But maybe, I don’t know, maybe you’re old enough to hear this now...
N: Now Margaret is even more interested. Barb releases a breath, has out with it.
C: BARBARA
D: The truth is... we don’t see my parents because they don’t want to see us.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret furrows her brow, not getting it. Barb tries to explain.
C: BARBARA
D: My mom and dad are very, very devout Christians, and before you were born, when your dad and I first fell in love, they told me they would never accept a Jewish son-in-law, and that if I wanted to marry him and ruin my life, that was my business...but I wouldn’t be their daughter any longer.
E: CONT'D
N: Retelling this story, Barb can’t help but feel those old emotions rising up in her.
C: MARGARET
D: But...you are their daughter.
N: Margaret doesn’t understand. Barb realizes she has to phrase this more clearly.
C: BARBARA
D: What I mean is that they... they decided they didn’t want me in their life anymore.
N: It’s difficult to say it so plainly.
C: BARBARA
D: And so... I’m not. It’s been that way going on 14 years.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret is pinned to her chair. Heartbroken for her mom.
C: MARGARET
D: Mom...
N: She moves towards Barb, wrapping her arms around her to comfort her. Barb feels herself choke up a little, then wills it back, not wanting Margaret to take this on, uncomfortable feeling their parent-child dynamic reversed. Barb gives her a little pat, reassuring Margaret she’s okay.
C: BARBARA
D: It was a long time ago, Margaret.
N: Barb smiles resiliently, determined to lift the mood.
C: BARBARA
D: Come on. I took dad to the train station so we’d have the car. We had a plan to go shopping, remember?
E: CONT'D
N: Barb stands to find her purse and keys. Margaret’s head is still whirling.
C: MARGARET
D: Are you there God, It’s me, Margaret. I can’t believe this.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SIMONS CHRYSLER - A LITTLE LATER
N: They drive to the mall.
C: MARGARET
D: How could they be so mean? Just because of a dumb religion?
E: V.O.
S: EXT. LORD & TAYLOR PARKING LOT - A LITTLE LATER
N: They near the entrance of the store.
C: MARGARET
D: My mom doesn’t deserve this. She’s a good person, she’s nice to everyone.
E: V.O.
N: Barb holds the door open for an absurdly long time, letting a whole parade of people go into the store before her.
C: MARGARET
D: Even when she doesn’t need to be!
E: V.O.
S: INT. LORD & TAYLOR DEPARTMENT STORE - A LITTLE LATER
N: They float up the ESCALATOR.
C: MARGARET
D: I mean, what the heck, God? How could you let this happen? Religion is supposed to bring people together and make them love each other more, isn’t that right there in all your books and stuff?!
E: V.O.
C: BARBARA
D: The bras are over there.
N: At the word “BRAS,” Margaret instantly SNAPS INTO THE PRESENT MOMENT, abandoning her conversation with God. She eyes the MANNEQUINS IN LINGERIE, suddenly very uncomfortable. Barb leads them through THE UNDERWEAR DEPARTMENT up to a SALES LADY (60’s), cat eye-glasses, built like a baked potato.
C: BARBARA
D: Excuse me, we’re looking for a bra for my daughter.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret immediately stares at her shoes, pretending to know nothing about this. The lady sizes up Margaret’s chest.
C: SALES LADY
D: Hmmmm. Well we don’t have many that small...
N: Margaret just about dies.
C: SALES LADY
D: Come’re, dear, let me measure you.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret reluctantly follows her to the REGISTER. The lady loops a TAPE MEASURE around her chest, puts a 2ND PAIR OF GLASSES over her cat-glasses to see the number.
C: SALES LADY
D: Barely 28. Not even a Double-A.
E: CONT'D clicks tongue, bad news
N: Margaret’s really starting to resent this lady.
C: SALES LADY
D: Your best bet is one these Gro-bras here. So one day when you do grow, it’ll grow with you.
E: CONT'D
C: BARBARA
D: Thank you. We’ll go try it on.
S: INT. LORD & TAYLOR DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Margaret and Barb step into a STALL.
C: BARBARA
D: You know how to put it on?
E: takes bra off hanger
C: MARGARET
D: Yes.
E: not at all
N: Margaret quickly takes the bra, turns around the opposite way to slip off her shirt, awkwardly fumbles with it, getting hung up in the straps.
C: BARBARA
D: Here, I’ll help you out.
N: Barb adjusts the straps, clasps the back.
C: BARBARA
D: There you go.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret slowly turns around, feeling extremely exposed.
C: BARBARA
D: What do you think?
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: I don’t know.
C: BARBARA
D: Well does it feel too tight?
C: MARGARET
D: I don’t think so.
C: BARBARA
D: Too loose?
C: MARGARET
D: No.
C: BARBARA
D: Try moving around a little.
N: Margaret wiggles her shoulders, pumps her arms.
C: BARBARA
D: How’s it feel now?
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Fine but I’ll be glad to take it off.
C: BARBARA
D: Yep. Welcome to womanhood.
S: EXT. MORNINGBIRD LANE - SATURDAY / DAY
N: The weekend in full swing. Neighbors weeding their yards, washing their cars, kids playing freeze tag.
S: EXT. SIMONS FRONT YARD - SAME
N: Barb gets the MAIL, sees her FURNITURE CATALOGUE has arrived. Flips through it a bit at the curb. Then looks up to see Herb rolling his NEW POWER LAWN MOWER onto the grass.
C: BARBARA
D: Look at you. Working the land... Heavy machinery...
C: HERB
D: Is it too much if I take my shirt off?
N: She laughs. Herb unbuttons one of his shirt buttons, starts the motor with extra manly flair. She bites her lip, pretending to be turned on. He pushes it across the lawn like a stud, popping a wheely.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BATHROOM - SAME
N: Just out of the shower in a BATHROBE, Margaret heads into--
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: She closes her curtains and gets some UNDERWEAR out of her drawer, pulls it on, then pauses, suddenly noticing something different. She bends over, looking closer. Her eyes widen. Hairs. She pretzels her head down closer, squinting at them.
C: MARGARET
D: 1 2 3... 4 5 6 7. Seven.
E: impressed
N: Not bad. She pulls the GRO-BRA out of LORD AND TAYLOR BAG, rips the tags off, wriggles into it with much effort. Then turns to study herself in the mirror. Flat as a board. She turns sideways, pulls her shoulders all the way back, pushing her chest out as far as she can. It makes no difference. She sighs, frustrated. Thinking, she gets two BALLED UP PAIRS OF SOCKS out of her top drawer, stuffs them into each cup. They’re ridiculous and misshapen. It doesn’t matter. She absolutely loves them. She walks cat-like around the room, feeling them out.
C: MARGARET
D: My name’s Laura Danker, what’s yours?
E: CONT'D sexy voice
N: She puts on one of her RECORDS: Chica Chica Boom Chic, by Carmen Miranda. Begins to DANCE around the room, swinging her sock-boobs back and forth, playing the bongos on them, her and her boobs becoming the star of their own music video. Suddenly, there’s a SCREAM from the front yard.
C: HERB
D: AHHHHHH!! DAMMIT!!!
E: O.S.
N: Margaret startles, yanked back into reality. She runs to the WINDOW, looks out it to see Herb next to the lawnmower with a VERY BLOODY HAND.
S: INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - LATER
N: Herb’s hand is BANDAGED UP now, embarrassed by his blunder after making so much fanfare. Barbara reads the LAWNMOWER DIRECTIONS to find out what went wrong.
C: BARBARA
D: “Always turn mower off before clearing grass clippings from the bag...”
C: HERB
D: Pssh. In sales we call that a design flaw.
N: Margaret squeezes past them carrying a GLASS OF WATER and a NOTEBOOK towards the backdoor, already excited about the silver lining: MOOSE IS CUTTING THE REST OF THEIR GRASS NOW.
S: EXT. SIMONS BACKYARD - SAME
C: MARGARET
D: Hi...
N: She puts the water down for him. He waves thanks. She takes a seat on a LAWN CHAIR, opens the LITTLE NOTEBOOK, where the words Boys I like are written & underlined at the top.
S: INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM - DAY
N: The four girls sit in a circle on the floor.
C: NANCY
D: Veronica?
C: GRETCHEN
D: I’m here.
C: NANCY
D: Kimberly?
C: GRETCHEN
D: Here.
C: NANCY
D: Mavis?
C: MARGARET
D: Here.
C: NANCY
D: And so am I...Alexandra.
C: JANIE
D: Why do we have to have these names again?
C: NANCY
D: Because it’s boring using our normal ones. Okay, time for boy books.... Everyone get them out.
N: Margaret opens her LITTLE NOTEBOOK, where she’s listed just one boy: Moose Freed. A LITTLE HEART by his name.
C: NANCY
D: So who wants to go first?
E: CONT'D
C: GRETCHEN
D: Like it matters. We already know who everyone put down.
C: NANCY
D: Philip Leroy!
C: JANIE
D: Of course...
C: GRETCHEN
D: It’s been the same since 2nd grade!
C: NANCY
D: What about you, Margaret? Who’d you put?
C: MARGARET
D: Oh... yeah, I put him too. Philip Leroy. He’s so cute.
E: closes her book
C: NANCY
D: Well, that was quick. Alright, time to check for bras.
N: Nancy walks behind each girl, feeling their backs for a bra strap.
C: NANCY
D: Gretchen has a bra, Janie has a bra, Margaret has a bra...and I have bra. Good. Now we have to go around and say what size it is.
E: CONT'D snaps her own
C: MARGARET
D: What? That wasn’t a rule.
E: eyes dart around, nervous
C: NANCY
D: It’s a new one, I just made it up.
C: GRETCHEN
D: Well mine doesn’t have a size, it’s a Gro-Bra.
C: JANIE
D: Yeah, that’s what I have too!
N: Margaret is so relieved she’s not the only one.
C: MARGARET
D: Same here.
C: NANCY
D: Not me. Mine’s a 32 Double-A.
N: Nancy puts her shoulders back, proud. They all look at her, impressed.
C: NANCY
D: If you ever want to get out of those baby bras, you have to exercise like I do.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: What kind of exercise?
E: suddenly very interested
N: Nancy stands, demonstrating.
C: NANCY
D: Hold your arms out like this, and then you do this motion over and over.
N: Nancy pumps her arms back and forth, flexing her pecks.
C: NANCY
D: I must, I must, I must increase my bust!
E: CONT'D
C: JANIE
D: That really works?
N: Margaret and Janie exchange a look, hoping so.
C: NANCY
D: Try it. You’ll see.
N: They all stand up, pumping their arms along with her.
C: ALL TOGETHER
D: I must, I must, I must increase my bust!
C: NANCY
D: Now squeeze real hard when you say it.
N: They all squeeze. Margaret squeezes harder than anyone.
C: ALL TOGETHER
D: We must, we must, we must increase our bust! We must, we must, we must increase our bust!
N: Suddenly, the BEDROOM DOOR SWINGS OPEN. Evan and Moose burst in, LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY.
C: NANCY
D: What are you doing?! Get out of my room!
C: EVAN
D: WE MUST, WE MUST, WE MUST INCREASE
C: OUR BUST!
D: Oooh I can feel it working, Moose!
E: groping his chest
N: Margaret is mortified.
C: NANCY
D: Shut up!!! Get out! Get out! Get out! Mommmmmmmm!!!
N: Nancy chases them out of the room, slapping at Evan.
S: EXT. NEW JERSEY BUS TERMINAL - DAY
N: Margaret is still cringing about what happened with Moose as she hurries with her parents to catch the BUS to NYC.
C: BARBARA
D: Grandma said she’ll meet you at the information desk. When you get on the bus, do not talk to anyone. Especially men. Either sit alone or pick out a nice lady.
C: MARGARET
D: I will.
C: HERB
D: If you don’t see Grandma when you get there, ask someone to help you.
C: BARBARA
D: But make sure it’s a lady, not a man.
C: MARGARET
D: Okay, you told me 20 times!
C: BARBARA
D: Excuse me, this little girl is traveling alone, can you please keep an eye on her?
E: to bus driver
C: MARGARET
D: Mommmmm.
C: BARBARA
D: Okay okay, g’bye.
N: Margaret gets on the bus, the doors closing behind her. Barb suddenly regrets this, second-guessing her parenting.
C: BARBARA
D: I hope this wasn’t a mistake.
E: CONT'D
N: Just then, a CRAZY HOMELESS LOOKING PASSENGER bangs on the side of the bus through his open window, yelling for the bus to MOVE. He flicks his CIGAR BUTT onto the tarmac. Herb smiles at Barb.
C: HERB
D: Nah.
S: INT. NY BOUND BUS - SAME
N: Margaret takes a WINDOW SEAT BY HERSELF in the back, staying away from the WEIRD GUY.
C: MARGARET
D: Are you there God? It’s me, Margaret. I’m a little nervous being alone so can you just not let anything really horrible happen?
E: V.O.
N: Margaret looks over to notice TWO NUNS sitting across the aisle from her.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh good. That makes me feel better.
N: She breathes a sigh of relief. Then considers--
C: MARGARET
D: You know, maybe Mr. Benedict had a good idea -- if I made my research project about religion, then I could finally pick one. Don’t worry, I won’t make any decisions without asking you first. What do you think, God?
E: V.O.
N: Margaret waits a sec, as if for an answer. Something inside her responds in the affirmative. She shakes her head.
C: MARGARET
D: Okay. We’ll do it.
E: V.O.
N: She looks out the window, feeling resolved.
S: EXT. PORT AUTHORITY BUS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Ten times more crowded than New Jersey’s terminal. Margaret stands on her toes, looking for her grandma, finally spots Sylvia, who’s a BLONDE now.
C: MARGARET
D: Grandma!
C: SYLVIA
D: You made it!!!
N: Sylvia sprays her with a CAN OF DISINFECTANT.
C: SYLVIA
D: It’s just Lysol, don’t worry about it. Just gettin’ the bus off. You look beautiful!
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: So do you. Your hair’s blonde!
C: SYLVIA
D: Everyone thinks I’m a show-girl! Come on, we don’t want to miss anything.
N: Sylvia whisks her away.
S: EXT. LINCOLN CENTER - MAGIC HOUR
N: Sylvia and Margaret climb out of a CAB, head up the steps towards THE ICONIC FOUNTAIN and MASSIVE COLUMNS all lit up.
S: INT. LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA PIT - A LITTLE LATER
N: A COUPLE VIOLINISTS playing Dance of the Little Swans.
S: INT. LINCOLN CENTER AUDITORIUM - LATER
N: 20 BALLERINAS spin in unison, performing SWAN LAKE. Sylvia and Margaret watch them, in awe. Margaret slips out of her flats to stretch her feet. Sylvia slides her high-heels off too, wiggles her stocking feet over to Margaret’s to give them a “kiss.” They smile at each other.
S: EXT. NYC - NIGHT
N: Margaret and Sylvia stroll through NYC after the show, goofing around pretending to be ballerinas.
S: INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - LATER
N: The WAITER sets TWO COMICALLY HUGE CHOCOLATE PARFAITS and a couple SPOONS in front of Margaret and Sylvia.
C: SYLVIA
D: Spoons? How about a shovel? Thank god I did 10 minutes of aerobics two weeks ago.
N: Margaret laughs. They dig in.
C: MARGARET
D: Grandma...I have to tell you a secret.
C: SYLVIA
D: Oooh. I’m listening.
C: MARGARET
D: I’m wearing a bra tonight, could you tell?
E: leans in, whispers
C: SYLVIA
D: I didn’t want to say anything, but bosoms run in the family...
E: smiles, conspiratorial
N: Sylvia makes a little gesture at her own good-sized bosoms. Margaret grins a mile wide.
S: INT. SYLVIA’S BEDROOM - LATER
N: Sylvia and Margaret are in nightgowns now, crawling into BED, Sylvia rubbing her face and hands with a MENAGERIE OF CREAMS lined up on her nightstand.
C: SYLVIA
D: I had a fabulous time tonight. You make a great date.
C: MARGARET
D: You too.
N: They crawl under the covers.
C: SYLVIA
D: Goodnight, honey. If I snore or pass gas, that’s not me, you’re just dreaming it.
C: MARGARET
D: Okay.
E: laughs
N: Sylvia switches off the LAMP. They lay in the dark for a sec.
C: MARGARET
D: Hey Grandma?
E: CONT'D
C: SYLVIA
D: Yes, Sugar?
C: MARGARET
D: Do you think I could go to Temple with you some time?
N: Sylvia’s EYES SNAP OPEN, she SITS UP, flips the LIGHT BACK ON, wide awake suddenly.
C: SYLVIA YOU BET YOU CAN!
D: We’re going in the morning, I gotta iron my suit!
E: jumps out of bed
S: EXT. NEW YORK SYNAGOGUE - NEXT DAY
N: TONS OF PEOPLE dressed to the nines. Sylvia leads Margaret towards the entrance, still ecstatic about this surprise twist of fate. As they pass the GREETER--
C: SYLVIA
D: I have my granddaughter with me today.
N: The GREETER nods politely, not caring at all.
S: INT. NEW YORK SYNAGOGUE - CONTINUOUS
N: They find their seats. Sylvia waves to more people.
C: SYLVIA
D: This is my granddaughter. Granddaughter.
E: looks at another group, points at Margaret
N: Margaret smiles hello at everyone, not quite sure how to act. Sylvia spots THE RABBI walking up to the PODIUM.
C: SYLVIA
D: There he is, that’s the Rabbi. Isn’t he handsome? He looks like Robert Redford. If Robert Redford had a large black beard and glasses.
E: CONT'D
N: The MUSIC BEGINS, signaling the service is starting. Sylvia squeezes Margaret’s arm.
C: SYLVIA
D: Here we go, it’s starting.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret sits up straighter, a little anxious.
C: RABBI
D: Welcome dear friends. So good to be here with all of you this morning. Shabbat shalom.
C: SYLVIA
D: Shabbat shalom means hello. And goodbye. And peace and harmony and other stuff.
E: whispers
N: Sylvia hands her a PRAYER BOOK. Margaret opens it backwards. Sylvia flips it around for her. Margaret already feels lost.
C: RABBI
D: So let us lift our voices in thanks to God this morning. We begin on page 124 of our prayer books-- Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha`olam....
E: reading
N: He keeps going in Hebrew. Margaret glances at Grandma for a translation, but Sylvia’s Hebrew ends at “Shabbat Shalom.” Margaret tries to follow but her eyes glaze over. She starts to glance around the room and COUNT HATS.
C: MARGARET
D: 1, 2, 3...4, 5, 6 brown ones. 1, 2, 3-- God, why am I counting hats?
E: V.O. then realizes
N: Margaret tries to focus again. The CANTOR sings, there are more prayers, more rituals, more Hebrew. Her posture begins to sags. TIME CUT: Margaret JOLTS, as if woken from sleep. Everyone stands up, the service over. Sylvia smiles.
C: SYLVIA
D: Wasn’t that lovely? Oh honey, congratulations.
N: Sylvia hugs her as if she’s officially jewish now.
C: MARGARET
D: I don’t know, God. The Rabbi seemed nice and I liked the music, but I guess I thought I’d feel something else. Like, you know --
E: V.O. MORE
C: MARGARET
D: “Laaaaaaaaaa!”.
E: V.O. CONT'D spiritual epiphany sound
N: Margaret’s a little disappointed. But Sylvia puts her arm around her, thrilled.
C: SYLVIA
D: And now we go to the deli and kvetch!
S: INT. SIMON’S KITCHEN - NEXT EVENING
N: Barb unloads the DISHWASHER, upset. Margaret puts away the silverware. Herb pulls a TV DINNER out of the oven.
C: BARBARA
D: I can’t believe she’d just take you to Temple without even asking us.
C: HERB
D: I can’t believe it took her this long.
C: MARGARET
D: I told you it was my idea. I just wanted to try it out, I’m gonna try church too, don’t worry mom.
C: BARBARA
D: Church is not the point. You don’t need to bother yourself with this stuff right now.
C: MARGARET
D: You said I can pick my religion when I grow up.
C: BARBARA
D: Yeah, when you grow up. When you’re an adult.
C: MARGARET
D: I’m almost 12. That is an adult.
N: Barb LAUGHS. Margaret feels mocked, shuts the silverware drawer, leaving the room.
C: BARBARA
D: Margaret...
C: HERB
D: Hey, I just turned on Fats Domino. Don’t leave, its groovin’ time.
N: He does a little jig to Aint That A Shame by Fats Domino, trying to change the mood. But Margaret keeps walking. Herb shrugs at Barb. He tried. She sighs, worried maybe she handled that badly. Herb sits down with his TV DINNER on a LAWN CHAIR he’s set up in front of the TV since they still don’t have furniture. Barb looks at him, feels like she’s failing as a wife too.
C: BARBARA
D: Sorry, I swear I’m gonna order the furniture soon, I just want to pick the right stuff, you know, so everything goes together, like how people have it.
N: Herb waves it away. No big deal.
C: BARBARA
D: And I was gonna cook dinner, I was going to, but the meat didn’t thaw and--
E: CONT'D
C: HERB
D: Hey hey hey, didn’t you hear what I said about “groovin’ time”? It’s all good, baby. Look at me, I’m leaned back to 3. I’m solid gold.
N: He gestures to his lawn chair, reclined to the 3rd notch. Barb laughs. This is why she gave up everything for him.
S: EXT. THE WHEELERS HOUSE - DAY
N: Moose rakes FALL LEAVES off the Wheelers’ grass.
S: INT. THE WHEELER’S HOUSE / DEN - DAY
N: Mrs. Wheeler sets a TRAY OF ICED TEA on the COFFEE TABLE. Barb and THREE OTHER MOTHERS ON THE CAMPUS IMPROVEMENT COMMITTEE sit in the den.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Here we are, ladies.
C: BARBARA
D: Thank you, Jan.
N: Barb takes a sip. A LEMON SEED gets in her mouth. She awkwardly spits it in her hand, embarrassed. She looks around, not sure where to throw it away.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: I’ll take it.
N: Mrs. Wheeler reaches out a hand. Barb drops it into her palm, feeling like a child. Mrs. Wheeler takes it to the trash, comes back.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: So, last year we replaced the school marquee... and this year, I had an idea to do something even more meaningful.
E: CONT'D
N: She smiles, very pleased with herself. The women wait in suspense.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: You know how ugly the ceiling in our Gymnasium is? We’ll have it refinished, painted completely black, and then we’ll hang little stars from it, with each Delano child’s name on them...
E: CONT'D
N: Mrs. Wheeler holds up a FELT STAR she cut out as an example.
C: PTA MOTHER
D: Awww. Our own night sky filled with our own little stars...
N: They all coo at that adorable image.
C: BARBARA
D: That’s so cute. How many stars do we need, how many kids are there?
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Twenty three hundred and two.
N: Mrs. Wheeler puts SEVERAL BOLTS OF LIGHT BLUE FELT and FOUR PAIRS OF SCISSORS in front of them. Barb blinks.
S: EXT. DELANO SCHOOL - DAY
N: ON THE BLACK TOP, WESTERN MUSIC plays, all the kids awkwardly SQUARE DANCING for P.E. Mr. Benedict reads the dance calls, way out of his comfort zone.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: And one and two and dosey-doe, all the way around the ring you go.
E: stiffly, from a Xerox MORE
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Now boys rock right, now girls go low, now all the way around and dosey-doe.
E: CONT'D
N: The kids are clumsy and terrible at it. Norman Fisher keeps stepping on Margaret’s feet.
C: NORMAN
D: Sorry. Sorry again.
E: does it again
N: Margaret gives Janie a look expressing her annoyance with Norman. Janie rolls her eyes, commiserating. The BELL RINGS, thank god. As the kids disperse, Nancy hurries over with Gretchen in a tow. She has a shit-eating grin on her face.
C: NANCY
D: Gretchen stole it.
E: whispers
C: JANIE
D: Stole what?
N: Nancy nods for Gretchen to show them. Gretchen slyly unzips her bag, giving them a peek: A HUMAN ANATOMY TEXT BOOK.
C: GRETCHEN
D: My dad’s book I told you about.
N: All the girls’ eyes get big. Margaret fidgets, nervous, feeling like an accomplice to a crime.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
N: C.U.: A DETAILED DRAWING OF THE MALE BODY, INCLUDING PENIS. The girls hover over it silently, taking it in.
C: JANIE
D: Whoa.
C: GRETCHEN
D: Do you think Philip Leroy looks like that?
C: NANCY
D: He’s male, isn’t he?
N: Margaret swallows. Checks the door again just to make sure no one can come in. HER DESK CHAIR is shoved in front of it.
C: JANIE
D: Veins. Uggckk...
C: GRETCHEN
D: That’s what everyone looks like inside their body.
C: JANIE
D: I don’t like it. It’s disturbing.
C: NANCY
D: Turn the page.
N: Gretchen flips the page to the book’s real gold: A CLOSE-UP DRAWING OF A PENIS AND TESTICLES. They all get very quiet again.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh my god...
E: whispers
N: Nancy grins. She was waiting for that reaction.
C: NANCY
D: My brother’s looks like that.
C: JANIE
D: Ew, how do you know?
C: NANCY
D: He walks around naked. I see it.
N: Margaret shakes off a visual of naked Evan.
C: GRETCHEN
D: My dad used walk around naked when I was little. His looked like that too. And really red. Like a bad sunburn.
C: JANIE
D: Oh god. Ew. I never want to see anyone naked or have anyone see me naked.
C: NANCY
D: What about when you get married?
C: JANIE
D: Especially then.
C: NANCY
D: Trust me, you’ll change your mind once you grow a little. Then you’ll want the whole world to see you, like the girls in Playboy.
C: JANIE
D: What girls in Playboy?
C: NANCY
D: You’ve never seen Playboy?
C: JANIE
D: Where would I see it?
C: MARGARET
D: My dad gets Playboy...
C: NANCY
D: Wait, so you have a copy here in this house? Go get it!
N: Margaret suddenly regrets revealing that.
C: MARGARET
D: I...I don’t know if I....
C: NANCY
D: Come on, Gretchen stole her dad’s anatomy book, it’s only fair you steal us the Playboy!
N: All of the girls look at her. Margaret feels the pressure.
S: INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER
N: Margaret tip-toes down the hallway, glances downstairs to check the coast is clear, sees Barb busy cutting out FELT STARS, a STRIP OF MUSTACHE BLEACH on her lip, standing by the TV watching a COOKING PROGRAM, hoping to learn something. Margaret continues down the hall to--
S: INT. BARBARA AND HERB’S MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: She slips inside, surveys the room. Tries the MAGAZINE RACK. Then Herb’s NIGHTSTAND. No dice. She kneels down, looks under his side of the bed. Bingo... The WHOLE STACK. She takes one, quickly stuffs it under her shirt.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER
N: The girls are all huddled behind Nancy as she opens the magazine, turning it long-ways so the CENTER FOLD UNFURLS. Their eyes adjust to the image.
C: JANIE
D: That isn’t like the science book...
C: GRETCHEN
D: Look how round they are... Mine look like little wizard hats.
E: disappointed
N: Margaret laughs. Gretchen gives her a look.
C: GRETCHEN
D: Hey, at least I have something.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret zips her lips.
C: NANCY
D: “Hillary Brite is 19 years old and loves waterskiing, horses, and going to the mall for an Orange Julius.”
C: GRETCHEN
D: Do you think any of us will look like that at 19?
N: They all look at each other, desperately hoping so. CUT TO:
C: ALL THE GIRLS
D: WE MUST, WE MUST, WE MUST INCREASE OUR BUST! WE MUST WE MUST WE MUST INCREASE OUR BUST!
N: Off their PUMPING ARMS--
S: INT. JANIE’S CHURCH - DAY
N: ANOTHER SET OF PUMPING ARMS, clapping rhythmically. A GOSPEL CHOIR, harmonizing with a A BADASS 80-YEAR-OLD LEAD SINGER/PASTOR, tearing it up with his killer pipes. Margaret stands with Janie and her FAMILY, clapping along. Margaret looks around, trying to feel out if this is “it.” It’s great, but she’s not so sure. JANIE’S MOM smiles over at her, making sure she’s having a good time.
C: MARGARET
D: Thanks for having me.
E: nods
N: She gives Margaret a little shoulder squeeze. Janie elbows Margaret, nods at an OLD WOMAN a few seats over, DEAD ASLEEP IN THE PEW despite all the action. They both laugh.
S: EXT. MORNINGBIRD LANE - DECEMBER / EARLY EVENING
N: The street is BURIED UNDER A FOOT OF SNOW now, all lit up for the holidays. CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, NATIVITY SCENES, PLUG-IN MENORAHS glowing in windows. The Simons is the only dark house on the block. Out front, Moose finishes SHOVELING THEIR WALKWAY before he loses the light, the last house on his route.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - SAME
N: Margaret watches from her bedroom window as he clears the last bit of now, then slings the SHOVEL over his shoulder to begin his walk home.
S: INT. SIMONS DINING ROOM - SAME
N: Barb sits at the table in her sweats and slippers, filling out “HAPPY NEW YEAR” CARDS. She looks at her ADDRESS BOOK for the next name on the list: “PAUL AND MARY HUTCHINS,” an OHIO ADDRESS... HER PARENTS. She pauses seeing it. Can’t help feeling a prick of sadness. Then, on an IMPULSE she can’t explain, she reaches for a BLANK CARD and scrawls out: “Dear Mom and Dad, I hope you’re both well. Love, Barbara.” She stuffs it into an ENVELOPE, licks and seals it before she can change her mind. Margaret comes up behind her.
C: MARGARET
D: What are you doing?
N: Barb turns around, startled. Then notices out the window behind Margaret--
C: BARBARA
D: Oh! The mailman. You’ve got your shoes on, will you run these out to him?
N: Barb scoops up the stack. Margaret takes it, hurries out the door.
S: EXT. SIMONS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: She rushes down the walkway, the MAILMAN already leaving.
C: MARGARET
D: Just a second.
N: He turns around, waiting for her. She sprints down to hand him the cards. Just as she does, she catches the name on the top envelope: PAUL AND MARY HUTCHINS. She freezes. Blinks.
C: MAILMAN
D: Thanks.
E: taking them
N: The mailman hands her the day’s MAIL in exchange.
C: MARGARET
D: Thank you.
N: Margaret’s mind is still on card, until something even more unusual catches her eye: A PIECE OF MAIL ADDRESSED TO HER. Who in the world would send her a letter? She tears it open. Come on over for a PARTY! Norman Fisher’s 12th Birthday Saturday December 20th, 5-7pm
C: MARGARET
D: Norman Fisher?
E: CONT'D
N: She rolls her eyes. What a let down.
S: INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER
N: Barbara is reading the invitation now, Margaret scrounging in the fridge, eating DELI MEAT from the package.
C: BARBARA
D: Who’s Norman Fisher?
C: MARGARET
D: No one. This weird kid in my class. I don’t why even he invited me, I barely know him.
N: The PHONE RINGS. Margaret picks it up.
C: MARGARET
D: Hello?
E: CONT'D
C: NANCY
D: Did you get invited?
E: O.S.
C: MARGARET
D: Yeah, to Norman’s? You did too?
C: NANCY
D: Everyone did. Janie and Gretchen and the whole class, even Philip Leroy.
C: MARGARET
D: Even Laura Danker?
C: NANCY
D: The whole class I said. My mom just talked to Norman’s mom who said it’s a big-deal dinner party, we have to dress up really nice.
C: MARGARET
D: Really?
N: Margaret’s expression is somewhere between panicked and thrilled. Her view of this party just changed dramatically.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Margaret frantically scours her closet, searching for something to wear, scared nothing is good enough. In QUICK CUTS, we see EACH OF THE GIRLS GETTING READY: They paint their fingernails, untangle costume JEWELRY, squeeze into TIGHTS, spritz perfume, shampoo, blow-dry, straighten, curl. They’re ON THE PHONE WITH EACH OTHER THE ENTIRE TIME, anxiously comparing notes. (The images are in direct contrast to the summer camp ones only months ago. Female self-consciousness has arrived in its full shitty glory.)
S: INT. BARBARA AND HERB’S MASTER BATHROOM - SAME
N: Margaret sits on the closed toilet seat in a BLUE VELVET DRESS, her knee bouncing nervously as Barb curls her hair.
C: MARGARET
D: This piece looks weird.
E: looking in the mirror
N: She points at a jagged curl sticking sideways. Barb tries to flatten it down. It doesn’t work.
C: BARBARA
D: There.
C: MARGARET
D: It’s still doing it.
C: BARBARA
D: Try licking your fingers and pushing it down, they’re gonna be here, you gotta put your shoes on.
N: Margaret scurries out of the bathroom, licking her fingers and trying to fix the curl. Herb passes her in THE HALLWAY.
C: HERB
D: Whoa whoa, who’s that showstopper?!
N: Margaret just rushes past him to her room, too nervous to hear a compliment. He shrugs it off, knowing he’s superfluous right now.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: She hurries through the door, finds her KITTEN HEELS in the closet, slips them on and crosses to the FULL LENGTH MIRROR for a last look. She likes her hair. Likes her shoes. Likes the dress. Then she looks at her chest. Frowns.
C: MARGARET
D: God? Really? It’s already December and still nothing? Please, come on, I’m not even asking for that much, just something.
N: Just as she says that, an IDEA begins to form.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Margaret closes the door behind her, a little scared about what she’s about to do. She opens the medicine cabinet, gets out the BOX OF COTTON BALLS... Then stuffs 3 into each side of her bra. She turns to see herself in the mirror. Her eyes light up, absolutely blown away by the improvement.
C: MARGARET
D: See. Three cotton balls. That’s all we’re even talking about.
N: SFX: Mrs. Wheeler’s CAR HORN. Nancy screaming Maaaargaret! Margaret realizes it’s time to go. Reaches in her bra to take out the cotton balls. Then...an IDEA. A radical one. She acts on it: Walks out the door, taking the cotton balls with her.
S: EXT. SIMONS HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Barb and Herb wave goodbye from the front door.
C: BARBARA
D: Thanks Jan!
C: HERB
D: Have fun tonight! Go easy on the whiskey and cigars!
N: Margaret climbs into MRS WHEELER’S STATION WAGON, squeezing in next to the GIRLS. She still can’t believe what she did.
S: EXT. NORMAN FISHER’S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
N: A large, modern home.
S: INT. NORMAN FISHER’S HOUSE - SAME
N: MRS. FISHER (30’s) sequined party blouse, opens the door.
C: MRS. FISHER
D: Girls, you look so pretty! Come in, come in, they’re all downstairs.
C: NANCY
D: Lovely house, Mrs. Fisher.
E: laying it on
N: They all follow Mrs. Fisher inside. Janie squeezes Margaret’s arm, nervous for their big entrance.
S: INT. NORMAN FISHER’S CONVERTED BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: They clomp down the stairs to the PARTY. Streamers tacked up. MUSIC playing. The boys have congregated one side of the room, girls on the other. Janie and Margaret exchange another look, not sure what they’re supposed to do with themselves.
C: MRS. FISHER
D: Alright, that makes everyone, Norman.
N: Seeing this is his cue, Norman picks up a spoon, TAPS IT ON HIS PUNCH GLASS. It’s too full and the punch sloshes out, dribbling down his pants.
C: NORMAN
D: Oops, uh, whoops.
N: He tries to sop it up with some cocktail napkins. His mother gestures for him to forget the stain and focus on the speech.
C: NORMAN
D: Uh, I just wanted to say thank you all for coming tonight and I hope you enjoy the evening. My mom made beanie weenies. Please, help yourself.
E: CONT'D
N: Norman lifts the SERVING LID from A FANCY SILVER PLATTER to reveal the BEANIE-WEENIES (CUT UP HOTDOGS FLOATING IN BAKED BEANS). The kids peer at it wearily. Norman senses it.
C: NORMAN
D: Uh, there are sandwiches too... and nuts if, uh, you like nuts.
E: CONT'D
N: He points to the SANDWICHES and NUTS. Freddy Barnett grabs a plate, goes for the beanie weenies. The rest of the kids start to follow. LATER-- Margaret, Janie, Gretchen and Nancy eat at a card table. Margaret’s eyes are on Laura Danker, standing on the other side of the room, the BOYS side, alone with her arms crossed. Margaret can’t help feeling oddly fascinated by her.
C: JANIE
D: I didn’t think she’d come, did you?
E: sees Margaret staring
C: MARGARET
D: How come she never talks to anybody...?
C: JANIE
D: I don’t know...
C: NANCY
D: ‘Cause she’s too busy doing other stuff, that’s why.
E: butting in
N: Gretchen laughs. Good one.
C: NANCY
D: Whatever, all I care about is Philip Leroy came...
E: CONT'D
N: They all turn to look at Philip Leroy. He’s bent over, sucking MUSTARD off his plate with a straw.
C: PHILIP LEROY
D: Hey, watch this.
E: taps Freddy
N: He aims the straw upwards, blows hard, making a BIG YELLOW SPLOTCH on the ceiling. They both crack up. Nancy grins.
C: NANCY
D: He’s hilarious.
N: Norman TAPS HIS PUNCH GLASS again.
C: NORMAN
D: Okay, now if everyone’s had enough to eat, we can start the games.
C: GRETCHEN
D: The games?
N: Everyone looks around. What kind of games? CUT TO: An EMPTY BOTTLE LAID SIDEWAYS on the floor.
C: FREDDY
D: Are you kidding Norman? This is the stupidest game ever.
C: NORMAN
D: But it’s a classic.
C: NANCY
D: Just play. Who spins first?
C: NORMAN
D: I’ll go first since it’s my birthday. And my bottle.
N: Norman spins. All the girls get nervous, hoping it doesn’t land on them. It lands on Janie.
C: JANIE
D: No...
E: sotto
N: Margaret shoots her a sympathetic look.
C: FREDDY
D: Ha ha! Norman and Janie have to kiss!!!
N: Janie swallows. Norman walks over, gives her a peck on the cheek. Except he misses her face, gets her hair instead.
C: FREDDY
D: That doesn’t count, you kissed her hair!
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Oh it’s fine, it counts.
C: NORMAN
D: No he’s right, I’ll do it again.
N: Janie looks sick. Norman does it again, connecting this time.
C: NANCY
D: Okay, now Janie’s turn to spin.
N: Janie spins. It twirls and twirls. Then lands on...Norman Fisher again. Everyone LAUGHS.
C: NORMAN
D: This is a great party.
C: MARGARET
D: Do we have to play this game?
C: FREDDY
D: I said that from the beginning!
C: NANCY
D: Fine, let’s play a different game. I have one. It’s called Two Minutes in the Closet.
C: MARGARET
D: What’s that?
C: NANCY
D: We all get a number, and then somebody calls, like, “number six” and then those two go in the closet and...you know...
N: All the kids get a little nervous imagining this. Margaret and Janie eye each other: Should we be doing this? CUT TO: Nancy holds a BASKET OF LITTLE NUMBERED PAPERS, the room tense with anticipation.
C: NANCY
D: Alright...
E: CONT'D
N: She holds the basket out to Freddy. He pulls one out.
C: FREDDY
D: Number 3.
N: Everyone looks around to see who 3 is.
C: GRETCHEN
D: Who’s number 3?
N: No one responds.
C: NANCY
D: Hellooo? Somebody’s gotta be three.
N: Laura Danker slowly stands up. She towers over Freddy, her chest at his eyeballs. Freddy turns bright red. Margaret can’t believe it. Philip grins, slapping him on the back.
C: PHILIP
D: Go ahead! Into the bathroom!
C: NANCY
D: Hey somebody get Freddy a step stool!
N: Everyone LAUGHS. Margaret can’t take her eyes off Laura as the two of them go into the BATHROOM. They close the door. The whole room goes SILENT, listening.
C: GRETCHEN
D: What do you think they’re--
C: EVERYONE
D: SHHHHHH!!!!!!
N: Gretchen shuts up. A few seconds pass. Finally, the door opens. Laura comes out, arms folded tightly over her chest, flustered, Freddy behind her. Everyone HOOTS and CLAPS. Freddy hands the basket to Philip, traumatized.
C: FREDDY
D: You’re next.
N: All the girls sit up, hoping Philip picks their number. Nancy prays so hard she could burst.
C: PHILIP I pick number...
D: 12.
E: oh the suspense
N: Nancy’s shoulders fall. Everyone looks around to see who 12 is. Margaret stares down at her number: 12.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh my god.
C: NANCY
D: What. You’re 12 Margaret?!
N: Margaret is still frozen. Philip does a crooked little smile at her. All the girls burn with envy. Margaret slowly stands, heart banging in her chest. The whole room watching intensely as they head towards--
S: INT. NORMAN’S BASEMENT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Philip goes in first. Margaret follows, hardly able to breathe. She slides the ACCORDIAN DOOR shut, all the kids eyes on her until the last inch of it closes. She’s about to turn around and face Philip when suddenly it dawns on her: The cotton balls. Her eyes widen, her hands reflexively fly up to her chest.
C: PHILIP
D: Margaret, turn around.
N: She realizes where her hands are, quickly drops them. Nothing she can do about it. She swallows, slowly turns around.
C: MARGARET
D: Hey...
C: PHILIP
D: Hey.
N: She gulps a gallon of saliva.
C: MARGARET
D: Um, so, do we--
N: Before she can finish, his LIPS ARE ON HERS. She’s stunned, completely unready. He pulls away, looks at her. Margaret can’t move. Then he leans in again, kisses her a second time. This one is LONGER and SLOWER. When he finishes, he grins, proud of that one. Margaret is frozen in her spot. He walks past her OUT OF THE BATHROOM. Standing there alone, a shocked little smile forms on her face. She looks down at her COTTON BALL BOOBS, then up at God, grateful. The bathroom fills with PRE-LAPPED CHURCH ORGAN MUSIC.
S: INT. NANCY’S PROTESTANT CHURCH - CHRISTMAS EVE
N: A LADY (90’s), thick glasses and puffed hair, hunches over the CHURCH ORGAN, playing. Margaret watches from a pew, the same goofy smile still on her face. Nancy is next to her, sick with jealousy.
C: NANCY
D: So he was a good kisser? Like really good?
C: MARGARET
D: Each of ‘em were pretty good, yeah.
C: NANCY
D: Each of them? So he kissed you more than once? Like how many times?
C: MARGARET
D: Uh...about 5, I think? I kinda lost count...
N: Nancy looks miserable. Margaret can’t help but gloat.
C: MARGARET
D: I know, God. I know. I shouldn’t be rubbing it in, especially here. But Nancy Wheeler is jealous of me. You gotta admit, it’s just too good.
E: V.O.
N: Margaret shakes her head, amazed by her good fortune.
S: EXT. NEW JERSEY - FEBRUARY / DAY
N: Winter is fading. Just dirty patches of ICE now.
S: INT. SIMONS’ LIVING ROOM - SAME
N: Barb is still cutting out FELT STARS, starting to get really sick of this task. She’s on the PHONE, trying to fundraise.
C: BARBARA
D: All donations are tax deductible and always go towards the school’s-- Oh. Uh, yeah. Okay, g’bye.
E: gets cut off
N: She hangs up. Cold-calling is not her strong suit. Then, something OUTSIDE THE WINDOW catches her eye. It’s A GOLDFINCH perched on a twig, yellow feathers catching the light just so. The image is so beautiful it breaks through something, reaches a place deep down inside her. On instinct, she drops the scissors, hurries out to--
S: INT. SIMONS’ GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Barb runs to her BOXES OF ART STUFF, rushes to get a CANVAS, EASEL, PAINT, PAINTBRUSH.
S: INT. SIMONS’ KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: She rushes back into the house. By the grace of God, the bird is still there. She sets up the canvas as quickly as she can, squeezes out a blob of PAINT, begins to make the first delicate strokes, when-- DING DONG! The doorbell rings. The goldfinch startles, FLYING OFF. Barb’s shoulders drop, genuinely disappointed. She sets down her paint brush, crosses through the DEN, opens the front door. Mrs. Wheeler is outside.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Hi Barbara! I just popped by to pick up your stars.
N: Mrs. Wheeler scans Barb’s appearance: undone hair, grubby house clothes. Barb feels it, reflexively smooths her hair.
C: BARBARA
D: Sorry, I’ve just been cleaning, uh, yeah I’ve almost finished them, please come in, sit down.
N: Mrs. Wheeler follows Barb into the DEN, looks for a place to sit. But HERB’S LAWN CHAIR is still the only seat, now joined by other make-shift furniture: an OVER-TURNED BUCKET as a side-table, an UPSIDE-DOWN CRATE as a footstool.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Uh...
C: BARBARA
D: Oh, pssh, would you believe it, I ordered new furniture 6 months ago, and they still haven’t sent it...
E: dying
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: It’s alright, I can’t stay long.
C: BARBARA
D: I’ll get the stars.
N: Barb gets the HUMONGOUS BOX from the dining room.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Thanks... Oh, and don’t say anything, but Deb’s stars came out a teensy bit lopsided. Yours are so good, do you think you could do her allotment too, our little secret?
C: BARBARA
D: Oh... Uh, Sure.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: You’re a doll, thanks. Well, gotta run, meeting the girls for Bridge.
N: Barb nods, walking Mrs. Wheeler out. She closes the door, rolls her eyes at herself: God, what’s wrong with me, why can’t I get it together?
S: INT. DELANO AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: ALL THE 6th GRADE GIRLS are gathered in the auditorium. ON STAGE IN THE WING, MRS. WEBSTER (50’s) in a boxy gray suit and orthopedic shoes, vigorously cleans her nostrils with a handkerchief. Then stuffs it in her pocket, clears away some throat phlegm, walks out ON STAGE.
C: MRS. WEBSTER
D: Hello, girls, my name is Ms. Webster, and today I’m here to speak to you about your changing bodies...
N: A few GIGGLES in the crowd. Margaret and the girls look at each other.
C: NANCY
D: Toldja this was the big sex movie.
E: whispers
C: MRS. WEBSTER
D: Some of you may have already begun to experience these changes.
N: Everyone looks at Laura Danker. She lowers her head.
C: MRS. WEBSTER
D: While some others of you... still haven’t experienced a single change at all.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret sinks down in her chair, sure all eyes are on her now.
C: MRS. WEBSTER
D: We’re going to watch a short film to learn a little more.
E: CONT'D
N: The LIGHTS GO DOWN and THE FILM begins: Images of GIRLS flashing on screen, all shapes, sizes, and colors. THE TITLE CARD comes up: “What Every Girl Should Know”
C: NARRATOR
D: All girls are different. But every girl has something in common. Between the ages of 9 and 16, her hips begin to fill out, her breasts become rounder and fuller, a soft growth of hair forms in her pubic area, and it is now that she begins to menstroo-ate.
E: O.S.
N: An animated UTERUS and OVARIES appear.
C: NARRATOR
D: Every month, a lining of blood forms in the uterus to prepare for pregnancy. If a baby is not conceived, the lining is released, flowing out of the body through the vagina.
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: The REACTIONS to the film vary dramatically: thrilled, fascinated, grossed-out terror-stricken, exhilarated, genuinely bereft.
C: NARRATOR
D: This...is menstroo-ation.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Menstroooooooooo-ation.
E: to Janie, imitating
N: Janie laughs.
C: GRETCHEN
D: Who do you think’ll get it first?
E: whispers
C: NANCY
D: Who do you know’ll get it last?
N: Nancy eyes Margaret, laughing. Margaret folds her arms, embarrassed and stung.
S: INT. MODERN FURNITURE STORE - LATER
N: Margaret follows Barb through ROWS OF MODERN JETSONS-LIKE FURNITURE, still thinking about Nancy’s joke.
C: BARBARA
D: It’s just I’ve wanted the house to look perfect and I’ve been so busy with the committees, and the stars, and trying to cook meals with all five food groups, which nobody tells you takes so long and is so boring, and you’ve gotta do it every...single...day... Do you like this egg-chair? I feel like I’m on a space ship.
E: sits in a CHAIR
C: MARGARET
D: When did you get your period?
N: Barb stops. Whoa. Left field.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh... Uh...
N: She gets up from the chair, trying to transition herself into a conversation she didn’t anticipate at this moment.
C: MARGARET
D: Just tell me how old you were.
C: BARBARA
D: I... 14?
C: MARGARET
D: 14?! That late?!
C: BARBARA
D: That’s not that late, I had a cousin who was 16.
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 78.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh my god, I’d kill myself! I’m definitely not waiting til I’m 16!
C: BARBARA
D: Afraid you don’t have much say in the matter.
E: laughs
N: Margaret doesn’t see the humor. Barb glances around the store, giving up the “modern” look. Just too weird for her.
S: INT. DELANO SCHOOL - MORNING
N: Margaret, Nancy, and Janie huddle over their MATH HOMEWORK, cross-checking answers.
C: NANCY
D: My mom’s taking me to The Rockettes next month ‘cause I got straight A’s, anyone wanna go? Only bad thing is my brother will be there with Moose.
C: MARGARET
D: I’ll go.
E: immediately
N: Nancy nods. Okay then. Gretchen runs up, breathless.
C: GRETCHEN
D: I got it!
N: They all just look at her, confused.
C: MARGARET
D: Got what?
C: GRETCHEN
D: It. My period.
E: lowers her voice
N: They all freeze. Holy shit.
S: INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM - LATER *
N: An emergency meeting to discuss this development.
C: NANCY
D: I can’t believe you got it first when I’ve got more than you.
N: Nancy gestures to her Double A’s, feeling gypped.
C: GRETCHEN
D: Well that doesn’t mean anything.
C: MARGARET
D: Just tell us how it happened.
C: JANIE
D: Yeah, start from the beginning.
C: GRETCHEN
D: Well I was sitting there at dinner and I felt something dripping from me. So I went to the bathroom, and pulled down my pants, and that’s when I saw the blood. So I called my mom and showed her. But she only had tampons, no pads, so she had to run to the store.
C: JANIE
D: What’d you do in the meantime?
C: GRETCHEN
D: I stuck a washcloth in my pants.
C: NANCY
D: Ew, no you didn’t!
C: GRETCHEN
D: An old wash cloth. Not like one we use all the time.
C: MARGARET
D: Okay, so go on, then what.
E: moving this along
C: GRETCHEN
D: So then my mom came home with the pads and I put one on, and, well...that was the whole thing.
C: NANCY
D: The whole thing? You haven’t even told us the good stuff yet!
C: GRETCHEN
D: I’ve told you everything.
C: NANCY
D: But, like, what does it feel like?
C: GRETCHEN
D: It feels like... nothing. Sometimes like leaking? It doesn’t hurt. I had some cramps last night, not too bad. My cousin said it kinda has a smell, but I haven’t noticed it yet.
C: MARGARET
D: It does? Like what?
C: GRETCHEN
D: She said it kinda smells like the monkey bars.
C: NANCY
D: The monkey bars?
N: They all look around, trying to remember that smell. Janie looks suddenly grief-stricken.
C: JANIE
D: I used to love the monkey bars...
E: memory tainted forever
N: Margaret is mesmerized.
C: MARGARET
D: Do you feel older now? Like more mature?
C: GRETCHEN
D: Oh yeah. I don’t know how to explain it, and you won’t understand until you get it, but I feel like everything has changed for me. I just feel different. Yeah...
E: utterly sincere wistful
N: Margaret’s insides twist with envy, wishing so badly she could feel that feeling.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
N: Margaret kneels at her bedside, hands clasped in prayer-pose, vomiting out a prayer, top-speed.
C: MARGARET
D: Are you there God it’s me Margaret, I’ve never been so jealous in my life, I hate myself for being so jealous, I’m a decent person, please! Please let me grow, please let me get my period, please make me regular and normal and like everyone else, please please please
E: rapid-fire in one breath
C: please please please PLEASE!!!
D: Amen.
E: finally exhales
N: She lays back on her carpet, exhausted. Something in the room catches her eye: THE LITTLE HANDMADE ANIMAL FIGURINES her dresser. Their childishness suddenly make her sick. She stands up, scoops them all up, drops them into a junk drawer, slams it shut.
S: INT. DRUG STORE - DAY
N: ANGLE ON: A SHELF FULL OF MAXI PADS, TAMPONS, PANTY LINERS. Reverse to see: Margaret and Janie stare intensely at it.
C: JANIE
D: I don’t know if I want to do this.
C: MARGARET
D: It’s not a big deal. It’s just so we’re ready, just in case.
N: But Margaret is extremely nervous too. She gathers her courage, plucks a BOX off the shelf. Janie wills herself to take one too.
C: MARGARET
D: Okay. Come on.
E: CONT'D
N: They hurry towards THE REGISTERS.
C: MARGARET
D: Please god let it be a lady...
E: CONT'D
N: They see the CASHIER: a SWEET LOOKING LADY (50’s). They breathe a sigh of relief. Just then, a PIMPLY 17-YEAR-OLD BOY changes shifts with her.
C: MARGARET
D: Nooo.
E: CONT'D sotto
C: JANIE
D: We can just put ‘em back.
N: Margaret pulls Janie towards the register, determined.
C: MARGARET
D: No. We’re doing it.
N: They walk up, set their TWO BOXES OF PADS on the CONVEYER BELT as casually as possible. The TEENAGE CLERK looks down at the pads, then up at them. They fold their arms, look away. He presses the button to roll the pads closer to him. It’s THE SLOWEST CONVEYER BELT IN HISTORY. Margaret and Janie watch, sweating, as the pads inch slowwwly by. Margaret finally can’t take it, grabs some TIC TACS, tosses them down with the pads so they aren’t alone.
S: EXT. DRUG STORE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Margaret and Janie burst out of the store, RUNNING AS FAST AS THEY CAN AWAY FROM IT. It’s SNOWING outside. They stop at the corner, out of breath. Look at each other, traumatized. Janie suddenly begins to LAUGH.
C: JANIE
D: The Tic Tacs...
N: Margaret shakes her head, LAUGHS too. It’s all so ridiculous. They loop their arms around each other, heading home, SNOWFLAKES floating down around them.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - LATER
N: CLOSE UP ON: A MAXI PAD. Margaret turns it over in her hands. Squishes it. Smells it. REVEAL: She’s crouched INSIDE HER CLOSET with the door closed. She peels off the paper strip, touches the sticky part a couple times. Then stands up, yanking down her pants. She hunches over, carefully sticking the pad in place. Then pulls up her pants again, WALKS OUT OF THE CLOSET. She moves around the ROOM, feeling it out. Stretches, kicks, squats. It feels like wearing a small diaper. Suddenly there’s KNOCK and the DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
C: BARBARA
D: You got a post-card from someone. Who’s in D.C.?
N: Margaret stiffens in an awkward pose.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh. Uh, Nancy. Must be from her. They went for Lincoln’s birthday.
N: Barb cocks her head a little, sensing something’s off with Margaret. She lets it go, hands her the post card, exits. When the door closes, Margaret flips it over. Nancy’s written just 3 words: I GOT IT! Margaret’s mouth drops open. Her mood plummets. In one spontaneous flurry, she tears up the card, hurls the pieces into the trash can, KICKS it over.
S: EXT. SYLVIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Sylvia is in her nightgown, digging in her closet, a half- packed SUITCASE open on her bed, along with BROCHURES for a FLORIDA VACATION. The PHONE rings. She goes to get it.
C: SYLVIA
D: Hello, Simon residence. Sylvia speaking.
E: utterly elegant
C: MARGARET
D: Grandma...?
N: She immediately knows something off in Margaret’s voice.
C: SYLVIA
D: Margaret? What’s wrong?
N: Margaret is crouched on the floor of the BATHROOM, the door shut, the PHONE CORD stretched as far as it will go.
C: SYLVIA
D: Honey...are you okay, what’s the matter?
E: CONT'D
N: It’s too hard to explain.
C: MARGARET
D: I...I just miss you.
N: Sylvia clutches her heart. Then does a silent fist pump.
C: SYLVIA
D: Aw honey, me too...
C: MARGARET
D: I’m coming to the city next week to see the Rockettes, do you think maybe I could come over after and stay the night like I did?
C: SYLVIA
D: Oh sweetheart... I wish, but I’ll be in Florida then. I heard about this hotel... there’s a lot of people my age, and you know...
N: Sylvia doesn’t quite want to say she’s going on a vacation to find friends, but she is. Margaret’s expression falls.
C: MARGARET
D: Okay...
N: Sylvia feels rotten, hating to let her down.
C: SYLVIA
D: Wait a minute, wait, what if you fly down to Florida and meet me for a few days? Isn’t your spring vacation soon?
C: MARGARET
D: The end of the March.
C: SYLVIA
D: Perfect! I’ll still be there!
N: Margaret perks up a little.
C: MARGARET
D: I’ll ask my mom and dad.
C: SYLVIA
D: Great, and--
C: MARGARET
D: And I’ll tell them it was my idea.
C: SYLVIA
D: You’re my girl.
E: grins, touched
N: Margaret feels her spirits lifted a little.
S: EXT. MORNINGBIRD LANE - EARLY EVENING
N: The sky is a pretty purple.
S: EXT. SIMONS HOUSE - SAME
N: The Wheeler’s STATION WAGON idles out front. Margaret opens the door to get in. She’s dressed up, her hair curled. MR. WHEELER (40’s)is behind the wheel in a suit, Mrs. Wheeler is all dolled up in the passenger seat.
C: NANCY
D: Hurry! Come on! Front row tickets!
N: Margaret scoots in. Looks back to see Moose sitting with Evan in the THIRD ROW, which FACES BACKWARDS out the rear window.
C: MARGARET
D: Hi...
N: Moose turns around, waves.
C: MOOSE
D: Hey.
N: Margaret buckles in, the back of her head an inch from the back of Moose’s. Physically closer than they’ve ever been, but facing complete opposite directions. Their proximity makes her feel a little tingly.
S: EXT. RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL - NIGHT
N: A SOLD OUT SHOW packed with TOURISTS.
S: INT. RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL - SAME
N: The LIGHTS GO DOWN as they find their seats in the FRONT ROW. Margaret looks to see where Moose is sitting. He’s in the FARTHEST SEAT AWAY. Bummer. The CURTAIN OPENS. They all face forward as THE ROCKETTES run out, burst into their BIG OPENING DANCE NUMBER. Margaret and The Wheelers tilt their heads way back, the front row too close to the stage. HIGH-HEELED LEGS swish past them, almost too close for comfort, a view right up their skirts. Nancy squeezes Margaret’s arm, giddy.
S: INT. “THE STEAK PLACE” RESTAURANT - LATER
N: An upscale place. MAHOGANY and GREEN BANKER’S LAMPS. The HOSTESS shows them to their seats, Nancy and Margaret still singing the music from the show.
C: NANCY
D: I’ll bet you a dollar I can kick that high.
C: MR. WHEELER
D: Uh-uh. Not in the restaurant.
E: as she starts to try
N: Nancy makes a face. He’s such a stick in the mud. They come to a LARGE ROUND TABLE. Margaret is smarter this time, strategically maneuvering into THE SEAT NEXT TO MOOSE. He puts his napkin on his lap. She does too. LATER-- The group is half-way through dinner. As Moose cuts his steak, his hand bumps Margaret’s.
C: MOOSE
D: Sorry.
C: MARGARET
D: That’s okay.
N: He drinks the last sip from his WATER GLASS.
C: MOOSE
D: Is the waiter anywhere.
E: looks around
C: MARGARET
D: Oh you can have mine, I didn’t drink out of it.
N: She scoots her WATER towards him. He thanks her, takes a big drink, then looks at her a moment, realizing something.
C: MOOSE
D: Hey, you know something I’ve always liked about you Margaret?
C: MARGARET
D: No...?
N: Whatever it is, she cannot wait to hear it.
C: NANCY
D: Come with me, I gotta go the bathroom.
E: interrupts
N: She tugs Margaret away, killing their moment.
C: NANCY
D: We’ll be right back. Don’t touch my food.
E: CONT'D to Evan
N: Margaret reluctantly follows Nancy, frustrated.
S: INT. “THE STEAK PLACE” BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER
N: The SOUND of Nancy peeing in the stall. Margaret waits at the sink, annoyed.
C: NANCY
D: I’ve had to go bad since we got here and then I drank two Cokes.
E: O.S.
C: MARGARET
D: Uh huh.
N: Margaret folds her arms, impatient. Then--
C: NANCY
D: Oh no. Oh no.
C: MARGARET
D: What?
N: Nancy’s tone is panicked.
C: NANCY
D: Oh please... Oh no...
C: MARGARET
D: Nancy? Are you okay? What’s the matter?
N: Margaret walks over to the stall.
C: NANCY
D: Get my mom. Please, quick!
N: Margaret tries to open the stall door, worried. It’s locked.
C: MARGARET
D: Let me in.
C: NANCY
D: No, please, just get my mom.
C: MARGARET
D: What’s wrong?
C: NANCY
D: PLEASE! Just go get my mom, please!
E: starting to cry
N: Margaret can tell this is something really serious.
C: MARGARET
D: Okay, don’t worry, I’ll be right back with her!
S: INT. “THE STEAK PLACE” RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
N: Margaret races over to Mrs. Wheeler.
C: MARGARET
D: Something’s wrong. Nancy’s crying, she needs you!
N: Mrs. Wheeler drops her fork, stands, alarmed. Evan, Moose, and Mr. Wheeler look at each other. WTF? Evan shrugs it off, reaches over and forks Nancy’s REMAINING STEAK, moving it to his own plate.
S: INT. STEAK HOUSE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Margaret and Mrs. Wheeler stand outside Nancy’s stall.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Nancy?
C: NANCY
D: Oh please mom, help me! Please.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: The door’s locked, Nancy, I can’t get in. You have to unlock it.
C: NANCY
D: I can’t-- I can’t--
E: crying
C: MARGARET
D: You want me to crawl under and open it from the other side?
N: Mrs. Wheeler nods. Margaret gathers her skirt up, crawls under. INSIDE, Nancy sits on the toilet, her face buried in her hands. Margaret unhooks the lock, pushes the door open.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Thank you.
N: Margaret goes over to wait by the sinks, worried.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Nancy, calm down. I can’t help you if you don’t stop crying and talk to me.
E: CONT'D
N: Nancy chokes back her tears, finally WHISPERS SOMETHING.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Ahh...
E: CONT'D understands
N: After a moment, Mrs. Wheeler cracks open the stall door.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Margaret? Would you get Nancy a pad please? From that dispenser on the wall?
E: CONT'D hands her a COIN
N: Margaret just stands there, confused.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Nancy got her period, honey.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Does she always act like that?
C: MRS WHEELER
D: It’s her first time. She’s just a little scared.
N: Margaret suddenly realizes Nancy was lying about her period. She gets the PAD from the dispenser, gives it to Mrs. Wheeler.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Thank you, sweetie.
N: After a moment, Nancy and Mrs. Wheeler come out of the stall.
C: MRS WHEELER
D: You wash up girls, I’m going to go tell the others not to worry. Don’t be long, okay?
N: She leaves. Nancy looks at Margaret, not sure what to say. They wash their hands in silence.
C: NANCY
D: Margaret, please don’t tell.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh Nancy...
C: NANCY
D: I’ll die if you tell Gretchen and Janie. Just please don’t tell them. I’ll... I’ll do something for you back. What do you want? I’ll do it.
C: MARGARET
D: Ugh, Nancy... I won’t tell them.
C: NANCY
D: Really, you won’t?
C: MARGARET
D: No... Don’t worry.
N: Nancy exhales, relieved. Margaret doesn’t know how to feel.
S: INT. THE WHEELERS’ STATION WAGON - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Margaret and Nancy ride back, sitting far apart.
C: MARGARET
D: Are you there God? It’s me, Margaret.
E: V.O.
N: Margaret glances over at Nancy, then stares out her window, lets out a SIGH.
C: MARGARET
D: I don’t even know what to say.
E: V.O.
N: The station wagon gets on the TURNPIKE back to New Jersey.
S: EXT. NEW JERSEY - MARCH / MORNING
N: SPRING now. Grass and flowers fighting their way back.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BATHROOM - SAME
N: Margaret raises her arm, sniffing her armpit. She doesn’t smell anything. She’s almost a little disappointed. She yanks the LID off a NEW STICK OF DEODORANT, applying it anyway.
C: BARBARA
D: Happy Birthday.
E: PRE-LAP
S: INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - SAME
N: Barb and Herb watch as Margaret opens her GIFT: A PLANE TICKET TO FLORIDA.
C: MARGARET
D: No way, I’m going to Florida? Thank-you-thank-you-thank-you.
E: they nod
N: She hugs them both, so relieved to finally have something good happen in her life. She needs this trip, bad.
S: INT. MR. BENEDICT’S CLASS - LATER THAT MORNING
N: Margaret walks into class, sees ALL THE DESKS HAVE BEEN REARRANGED.
C: MARGARET
D: What...? Why do we have new seats?
N: She looks over at Janie, who’s holding a BALLOON and RECORD ALBUM wrapped in a BOW.
C: JANIE
D: He said we’re in groups now. To study different countries.
N: They look traumatized to be separated.
C: JANIE
D: Well, happy Birthday.
E: CONT'D
N: Janie hands her a RECORD ALBUM, trying to lift the mood.
C: MARGARET
D: Aw, thanks...
N: They hug, but it still feels like a somber occasion. Margaret looks around to find her new seat. Sees her name in the “BELGIUM” group. Right beside Norman Fisher. She rolls eyes. Of course. She sits down next to him. He smiles. He inches her chair away. Just then, Laura Danker takes the seat across from her. Margaret can’t believe her bad luck. Seriously, God? There’s one seat left. Who will it be? She sees Philip Leroy stroll up. She perks up, everything suddenly better.
C: PHILIP
D: Happy Birthday.
E: sees the present
C: MARGARET
D: Oh. Thanks.
N: She smiles. Philip PINCHES her hard on the arm.
C: MARGARET
D: Ouch!
E: CONT'D
C: PHILIP
D: That’s a pinch to grow an inch. And you know where you need that inch.
N: He gestures at her flat chest. Margaret blinks, shocked, stung, pissed. Philip grins at Laura, checking out her boobs.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - LATER
N: Margaret bursts into her room, hurls down her backpack.
C: MARGARET
D: Are you there God, it’s me, Margaret! I hate Philip Leroy! I hate him! I hate Laura Danker, too, with her great big chest “oooh look at me everyone, I’m wearing a sweater!” I hate Nancy, that liar, and Mr. Benedict with his dumb ideas, and Norman Fisher, the way he reads with his lips flapping all around! Please, please, just hurry up and get me to Florida!
E: imitates Norman’s silent reading, his lips moving like crazy
N: She crumbles onto her bed, spent.
S: EXT. SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY
N: A cloudy day, the sky threatening to rain.
S: INT. DELANO SCHOOL LIBRARY - AFTERNOON
N: Margaret and Laura are surrounded by BOOKS ON BELGIUM. Margaret is in a truly awful mood.
C: MARGARET
D: Philip and Norman should be here. They make us do all the work.
N: Laura doesn’t say anything, just keeps working.
C: MARGARET
D: What time’s your mom picking you up?
E: CONT'D
C: LAURA
D: Not ‘til later. I have to go to St. Thomas for Confession first.
C: MARGARET
D: Confession?
N: Laura regrets telling her that.
C: LAURA
D: It’s just something you have to do when you’re Catholic.
C: MARGARET
D: What do you confess?
C: LAURA
D: Things.
C: MARGARET
D: What kinds of things?
N: Laura gives her a look.
C: MARGARET
D: Never mind.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret jots down some more info on Belgium. Laura sees what she’s writing.
C: LAURA
D: You’re just copying that straight out of the World Book.
C: MARGARET
D: I only copied four words.
C: LAURA
D: So. You can’t do that. We’re supposed to write it in our own words.
C: MARGARET
D: It’s four words. “Germany” “invaded” “Belgium” “when”...
C: LAURA
D: You’re still cheating. Mr. Benedict will know if you’re cheating.
C: MARGARET
D: I’m not cheating! Jeez, quit acting like you know everything and are so great!
C: LAURA
D: This has nothing to do with being great.
C: MARGARET
D: Whatever. I know all about the stuff you do...
C: LAURA
D: What’s that supposed to mean?
N: The LIBRARIAN (70’s) looks up from her post.
C: LIBRARIAN
D: Quiet, girls.
C: MARGARET
D: I heard about you and Moose Freed.
E: whispers
C: LAURA
D: What about me and Moose Freed?
C: MARGARET
D: Oh about how you and Evan and Moose go behind the A&P.
C: LAURA
D: Why would I do that?
C: MARGARET
D: I don’t know why you do it, but I know why they do it -- so they can feel you or something and you let them!
N: Laura slams her book shut, stands up.
C: LAURA
D: You’re a liar! You’re lying!
C: MARGARET
D: I’m not lying.
C: LAURA
D: You’re just like Nancy. All you do is pick on people and make up stories! You think I don’t know about you and your friends?!
N: Laura grabs her backpack, hurries towards the exit. It suddenly hits Margaret that Nancy might’ve lied about Laura too. She gathers her stuff up.
S: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
C: MARGARET
D: Laura, wait. Wait up.
N: Laura won’t turn around, just keeps walking.
C: MARGARET
D: Please.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret finally catches up with her.
C: MARGARET
D: Laura, listen---
E: CONT'D
C: LAURA
D: You think I don’t know you all make fun of me like it’s some kind of game?!
N: Margaret doesn’t know what to say.
C: LAURA
D: You think I want to be the biggest kid in class?
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: I don’t know...
C: LAURA
D: How would you feel if you had to wear a bra in 4th grade and everybody called you names just because of how you look?!
C: MARGARET
D: I’m sorry, Laura...
N: Laura’s throat tightens.
C: MARGARET
D: If you want the truth, I wish I looked more like you than me.
E: CONT'D
N: Laura turns away, walking off again, not wanting Margaret to see her cry.
C: MARGARET
D: Laura, wait. I really am sorry.
E: CONT'D
N: Laura runs up the steps of the CATHOLIC CHURCH, disappears inside, leaving Margaret alone on the sidewalk. Margaret stands there a moment, feeling awful. Not sure what to do. She heads up the steps, following Laura into the church.
S: INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
N: It’s dim, with towering stain glass windows. Margaret looks around. No sign of Laura. She slowly makes her way down the aisle, peering up at the ceiling, a mile high, feeling very, very small in this place. Her eyes wander to the BURNING PRAYER CANDLES. Then to a STATUE OF MOTHER MARY, staring down at her, arms outstretched, as if to gently scoop her up. The SOUND of a DOOR CREAKING OPEN. She spins around to see Laura coming out of the CONFESSION BOOTH. Margaret ducks behind a pew, watching Laura cross the sanctuary and leave. She stands again, stares for a moment at the small door Laura came out of. She begins to move towards it, step by step, until she’s right there in front of it. Then slowly, anxiously, she opens it to see what’s inside. A dark, empty space the size of a phone booth. Margaret debates a moment, then decides to go in. She sits on the small stool, pulls the door shut. She looks around the tiny space, her breath held tight in her chest. Is this where God is? In here?
C: MARGARET
D: God...?
E: whispers
N: She waits for something to happen. A Presence to arrive. Or a feeling. Something real and true and unmistakable.
C: VOICE
D: Yes, my child.
E: O.S.
N: Margaret STARTLES, not expecting that. A SHADOW shifts beyond the screen beside her and she realizes a PRIEST is there. Her eyes dart around, not sure what to do.
C: PRIEST
D: Do you have something you’d like to confess?
N: Margaret has no idea how to bare her soul to another person the way she does to God.
C: MARGARET
D: Um, I... I... I did something awful... I...I’m sorry...
E: then
N: She can’t do it. Flings open the confessional door, runs out.
S: EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
N: Margaret hurries down the church steps, spilling her heart, confessing. It’s beginning to LIGHTLY RAIN.
C: MARGARET
D: I’m the worst person who ever lived, God. I picked on Laura Danker just because I felt mean. Why did I do that? I’ve been looking for you, God. I looked for you in Temple, I looked for you in Church, and I looked for you just now when I went to confess. You weren’t there. I didn’t feel you at all. Why God? Why do I only feel you when I’m alone?
N: She sighs, defeated by herself.
S: EXT. SIMONS HOUSE - SAME
N: Barb runs to get the MAIL in the RAIN.
S: INT. SIMON’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: As she steps into the foyer, she sees the RETURN ADDRESS on one of the letters: PAUL AND MARY HUTCHINS, Ohio. She stops. Her spirit melts right out of her body. She opens the letter, shaking as she reads it.
S: INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - LATER
N: Barbara waits as Herb READS the letter.
C: HERB
D: “Dear Barbara, your card felt like an answer to prayer. Your father and I have been thinking about you a lot. We’re getting older, and suddenly, more than anything, we’d like to see our only daughter and finally get to know our granddaughter, Margaret Ann. We’re flying east next week, April 20th. We sincerely hope you’ll let us visit. Love, your mother Mary Hutchins.”
N: Herb sets it down, slowly peels off a pair of reading glasses. Barb waits, breath held, for his response. For the first time, he is not his jovial self.
C: HERB
D: You sent them a card.
E: CONT'D
N: She lowers her voice, a little embarrassed.
C: BARBARA
D: I...I don’t know why.
N: She really doesn’t. Herb gets to his feet, begins to pace, trying to keep a lid the swell of emotions rising up.
C: HERB
D: Do you remember that first year after they “cast” you out? What that was like for you? The way you felt?
C: BARBARA
D: I know... And the way they treated you... I’m sorry.
C: HERB
D: You really want to open that door again? We have a good life, we’re happy, is it worth it?
N: Barbara genuinely considers this question.
C: BARBARA
D: They’re my parents.
E: quietly, simply
N: Herb slowly inhales and exhales, accepting it even though he doesn’t like it. Barb reaches for his hand, knowing this can’t be easy for him. Margaret walks through the FRONT DOOR, registers the energy in the room.
C: MARGARET
D: What’s going on?
N: Barb and Herb exchange a look about how to handle this. Herb makes a decision--
C: HERB
D: Margaret should know.
C: MARGARET
D: Know what? What is this?
C: HERB
D: It’s from your mom’s parents. It concerns you.
E: hands her the letter
N: Margaret looks at Barb, she takes the letter, quietly reads through it as Herb and Barb wait. Then:
C: MARGARET
D: They’re coming here next week?
N: Barbara nods.
C: MARGARET
D: I won’t be here, I’ll be in Florida.
E: CONT'D
N: Barb doesn’t say anything. Herb looks down.
C: MARGARET
D: What? I’m still going to Florida, aren’t I?
E: CONT'D
C: BARBARA
D: Margaret, look...
C: MARGARET
D: I can’t go to Florida now?! But I don’t even want to see them! I want to see Grandma!
C: HERB
D: We promise you’ll go to Florida another time...
C: MARGARET
D: I don’t want to go another time! Does Grandma know about this?!
C: BARBARA
D: No, we need to call her.
C: MARGARET
D: I’m not calling her, you can do it yourselves!
N: Barbara tries to calm her down, defuse this.
C: BARBARA
D: Alright. Alright. I’ll call her now.
E: softly
N: Barb goes over to the PHONE, dials. Margaret cannot believe this is really happening. Herb rubs his forehead, wishing it wasn’t.
S: INT./EXT. SYLVIA’S FLORIDA CONDOMINIUM - SAME
N: Sylvia wears a BATHING SUIT and SARONG. She carries a CHEESE PLATE out to her VERANDA, setting it down in front of MORRIS BINAMIN (70’s) a good-looking white-haired gentleman pouring them each a GLASS OF WHITE WINE. She’s uncharacteristically nervous. Yanks at her bathing suit top a little, worried about her cleavage.
C: SYLVIA
D: Here we are...
E: trying to be elegant
N: Mr. Binamin smiles, he raises his glass, toasting to their little date.
C: MR. BINAMIN
D: This looks wonderful.
N: The PHONE RINGS inside.
C: SYLVIA
D: One moment... Don’t eat all the cheese without me.
E: before she goes in MORE
C: SYLVIA
D: Just kidding, eat at much as you want! Depending on your cholesterol! I’m just being funny I’m not asking what it is! But I’m sure it’s low!
E: CONT'D
N: She laughs nervously, then turns around, making a face at herself for being insane around him. She answers the phone.
C: SYLVIA
D: Simon Residence.
E: CONT'D
C: BARBARA
D: Sylvia, it’s Barb. Look, um...
N: Barb struggles for how to begin. Margaret can’t take it, goes over and yanks the phone away.
C: MARGARET
D: Just give it to me, I’ll tell her. Hello Grandma?
C: SYLVIA
D: Tell me what.
C: MARGARET
D: That I... that I can’t come to Florida.
N: Margaret hates hearing herself say those words. Sylvia’s expression falls.
C: SYLVIA
D: What. What do you mean?
C: MARGARET
D: We got a letter that my other grandparents are coming.
N: Sylvia’s posture changes.
C: MARGARET
D: I just really wanted to see you...
E: CONT'D getting choked up
C: SYLVIA
D: Put your mother back on the line.
N: Margaret hands the phone to Barb.
C: SYLVIA
D: Barbara, what the hell’s going on?
E: CONT'D
C: BARBARA
D: I’ll explain later Sylvia, it’s just one of those things, I hope you can understand. I’ve gotta go.
N: Barb hangs up before Sylvia can protest.
C: BARBARA
D: Margaret, I’m sorry...
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret heads up the stairs, upset. Barb looks at Herb, feeling bad for him too.
C: BARBARA
D: I’m sorry...
E: CONT'D
N: He puts up his hands. It is what it is. She looks at their EMPTY DEN, suddenly realizing she’s also completely unprepared for having her parents.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh god. And this.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. TRADITIONAL STYLE FURNITURE STORE - DAY
N: Barb heads up the sidewalk, Margaret reluctantly following.
C: MARGARET
D: Are you there God? It’s Me, Margaret. I’m absolutely miserable. Everything is just going to crap. Maybe this is my punishment for being a horrible person to Laura Danker.
E: V.O.
N: On their way into the store, Barb notices A GOOD-LOOKING COUPLE staring at a FANCY FURNITURE SET IN THE STORE WINDOW.
C: MARGARET
D: Please, right now, just do this one thing for me, I’m begging you: make something happen so they don’t come and I can still go to Florida.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. NEW JERSEY AIRPORT - DAY
N: The PLANE lands, her grandparents arriving.
S: EXT. NEW JERSEY AIRPORT TARMAC - A LITTLE LATER
N: Margaret has a bitter, cheerless expression as she and Barb wait for her grandparents to de-board a PARKED PLANE. Barb wears a stiff tailored dress unlike anything else she owns, her stomach in knots. She looks over at Margaret.
C: BARBARA
D: Please Margaret. Even if it’s fake, can you just try to look happy? Or least not so unhappy?
C: MARGARET
D: Why do you even want to see them? After what they did to you?
C: BARBARA
D: Because I...I want them to see how great we turned out. How proud I am of our family...
N: Margaret just looks away. Every bit of this is unfair. Barb suddenly spots her parents. Her stomach drops.
C: BARBARA
D: That’s them.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret looks over to see them coming down the PLANE’S STAIRS. MARY HUTCHINS (70’s), soft white hair, ruffled blouse, black orthopedic shoes. PAUL HUTCHINS (70’s), plaid shirt, suspenders, the identical shoes as Mary. Barb feels a jolt of emotion seeing how much they’ve aged. She breathes it away.
C: BARBARA
D: HERE WE ARE, OVER HERE.
E: CONT'D waving them over
N: The Hutchins look up, coming over towards them.
C: BARBARA
D: Hi...
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: Hello...
N: Barb doesn’t know whether to hug them. The moment to decide passes.
C: BARBARA
D: It’s good to see you.
C: MARY
D: You too, Barbara. And this must be Margaret Ann...?
N: Margaret pastes on a smile, trying to be polite.
C: MARGARET
D: Hi.
C: MARY
D: We’re very glad to meet you.
N: Mary gives her a stiff kiss on the forehead. Margaret tenses as she does. Paul just sticks with a pat on the back.
C: PAUL
D: Yes we are.
N: Barb tries to act breezy.
C: BARBARA
D: Well, should we get the bags? Herb’s got the car running.
S: EXT. AIRPORT PARKING LOT / LOADING ZONE - A LITTLE LATER
N: Herb waits by their idling Chrysler in a shirt and slacks, a fresh haircut. He sees them approaching.
C: HERB
D: Hi there.
N: Herb smiles, anxious but trying to be his affable self.
C: BARBARA
D: Hey. Mom, dad, you remember Herb...
C: PAUL
D: Hello, Herb.
N: Paul puts out his hand. Herb shakes it.
C: HERB
D: Hi Paul. Mary, how are you?
C: MARY
D: Just fine, thank you for having us.
C: HERB
D: Well, welcome to scenic New Jersey.
E: nods politely
N: Herb gestures to their SHITTY SURROUNDINGS, making a joke. Paul and Mary take him as sincere, look around to take in the scenery, nodding. Herb gives Barb a look. Margaret cringes a little.
S: INT. SIMON’S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
N: They all come through the front door, Herb carrying Paul and Mary’s bags.
C: BARBARA
D: Here we are, make yourselves comfortable...
N: She leads them into the LIVING ROOM, now furnished with the SET FROM THE STORE WINDOW. Mary nods in approval.
C: MARY
D: Lovely home.
N: Barb smiles, relieved.
C: BARBARA
D: Margaret can show you to your room. I’ll just start getting dinner ready.
N: Barbara looks at Margaret to take them upstairs. She doesn’t want to, but goes along.
C: MARGARET
D: Up this way...
C: MARY
D: Thank you. Gosh, you look like your mom when she was your age.
C: PAUL
D: Yes you do. And I’ll bet you’re smart just like her too.
N: They’re being so nice, it’s hard to be mad at them. She softens a little.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh. Uh. Thanks.
S: INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - SAME
N: Barb opens a CAN OF CAMPBELL’S CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP, dumping the grey gelatinous blob onto a RAW CHUCK ROAST. She checks the RECIPE. That’s it, just one ingredient. She can’t mess it up. Herb comes up behind her, checking on her.
C: HERB
D: How are you doing?
C: BARBARA
D: How are you doing?
C: HERB
D: I make small talk for a living and I’m already out of material. Help. Sports teams? TV shows they used to like?
C: BARBARA
D: I don’t know. Game shows mostly?
N: Herb files it away. Then: DING DONG, the DOORBELL rings. They both look at each other. Who could that be?
S: INT. SIMONS LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Herb opens the door. SYLVIA AND MR. BINAMIN are on the porch.
C: HERB
D: Mom?
C: SYLVIA
D: This plant is dying from too much water.
N: She points to a YELLOWING PLANT on their front step. Barbara comes around, freezes.
C: BARBARA
D: Sylvia? What’s going on?
C: SYLVIA
D: Margaret said she needed to see me, so we flew here from Florida. Are your parents here yet? This is Morris Binamin.
C: MORRIS BINAMIN
D: Rhymes with cinnamon.
N: Sylvia smiles casually, as if this isn’t the slightest bit nuts. Barb is speechless. So is Herb. Margaret comes downstairs with her grandparents, sees Sylvia.
C: MARGARET
D: Grandma?
C: SYLVIA
D: There’s my girl!
N: Margaret runs down to hug her. Sylvia makes a big show of it for Barbara’s parents’ benefit. Paul and Mary aren’t sure what’s going on.
C: MARY
D: Uh...
N: Barb just throws up her hands.
C: BARBARA
D: Mom and Dad: Sylvia. Sylvia: Paul and Mary.
S: INT. SIMONS’ DINING ROOM - LATER
N: They all sit around the dinner table. Sylvia is on one side of Margaret, Mary on the other. Everyone is trying to be on their best behavior.
C: SYLVIA
D: Dinner is delicious. What is it made of?
C: BARBARA
D: Soup.
C: SYLVIA
D: Ah.
C: MARY
D: Very nice.
E: nodding
N: Everyone agrees it’s great. Margaret nods too.
C: BARBARA
D: Well, I’ll admit it was a bit of a jolt, but...it’s nice to have us all together. The whole family. And Mr. Binamin.
E: then
N: They all look at Mr. Binamin. He smiles.
C: SYLVIA
D: L’chaim.
E: Raises her glass to that
N: Barb and Herb both react to the Hebrew.
C: SYLVIA
D: L’chaim. L’chaim. L’chaim. L’chaim.
E: CONT'D toasts everyone 1-by-1
N: Sylvia puts the glass down and nobody can think of what to say for a second. Herb turns to Paul and Mary.
C: HERB
D: See that young kid on Jeopardy?
S: INT. SIMONS KITCHEN - LATER
N: Barb and Herb clean up from dinner, relieved to have a break from the group.
S: INT. SIMONS LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Margaret sits on the couch opposite Paul and Mary. Sylvia and Morris are on the other side of the room, helping themselves to some ICE TEA and a TRAY OF DESSERT COOKIES.
C: MARY
D: There’s just so much we want to get to know about you, Margaret...
C: PAUL
D: 12 years is a lot to catch up on.
N: They look at her with a genuine longing for the years they missed. Margaret can feel their sincerity.
C: MARGARET
D: Yeah... Long time...
C: PAUL
D: We were wondering if you go to Sunday School? Or have ever thought about it?
N: Margaret’s smile falters, not expecting that. Sylvia overhears it, interjects.
C: SYLVIA
D: Nope. Never. Not once.
N: Mary smiles tersely at Sylvia, staking her own territory now.
C: MARY
D: We asked Margaret the question. Margaret?
N: Margaret couldn’t look more uncomfortable.
C: SYLVIA
D: You’re wasting your time, Margaret already went to Temple. She’s Jewish.
N: Margaret looks over at Sylvia. Herb and Barb walk in from the kitchen to hear this. Can’t believe their ears.
C: BARBARA
D: Excuse me?
C: HERB
D: Mom, that’s it. Cut it out. You’re done here.
E: sternly
C: SYLVIA
D: I’m done? You left the room and they’re trying to convert her!
C: PAUL
D: Margaret has a right to be baptized if she wants to be.
C: BARBARA
D: Baptized?
N: Barbara can’t believe they’re doing this. Margaret sinks down in her seat, desperately wanting out of this room. Herb finally has enough, seizes control.
C: HERB
D: This discussion is over. No more. We are her parents and Margaret will pick her own religion when she grows up, if she even wants one.
C: SYLVIA
D: Except she already did and she’s Jewish.
C: MARY
D: Well she’s Christian in our eyes.
C: HERB
D: MARGARET IS NOTHING. MARGARET IS NO
C: RELIGION UNTIL MARGARET DECIDES
D: THAT MARGARET--
N: As they argue, we push in on Margaret’s face. Finally, something vital inside her BREAKS.
C: MARGARET
D: Stop it! Stop it! I don’t care anymore! I don’t care! I don’t want a religion anyway! It’s all stupid, I hate it! I don’t even believe in God!
E: bursts to her feet
N: All the adults shut up, stunned. Margaret rushes out of the room, hurries UP THE STAIRS.
S: INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: She throws her DOOR shut, about to give God a piece of her mind. Then stops, realizing it’s useless anyway. He’s not even there.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: The adults just stand there, regretting how that went, no one sure what to say now.
S: EXT. MORNINGBIRD LANE - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Dark now. The glow of street lights.
C: MARGARET
D: Dear Mr. Benedict...
E: V.O.
N: Barb and Herb see Sylvia and Mr. Binamin off in one TAXI, her parents off in another. Everyone seems exhausted. Sylvia looks apologetically at Mr. Binamin, worried her family drama turned him off. He pats her reassuringly.
C: MARGARET
D: I finished my year-long study of religion.
E: V.O.
N: Barb and Herb watch both cabs drive off down the street. Barb sighs. Herb loops an arm around her: Well, just us again.
C: MARGARET
D: I went to a Jewish Temple, a Presbyterian church, a Protestant church, and a Catholic church.
E: V.O.
S: INT. MARGARET’S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Margaret switches on a SMALL DESK LIGHT, pulls some PAPER and a PEN out of her DRAWER, begins to write.
C: MARGARET
D: What I learned about religion is that it makes people fight. And that every religion says the same thing: If you pray to God, he’ll listen to you, and help you, and make things better. But I’ve prayed and prayed, and everything just gets worse. I don’t know anymore, but I think--
E: V.O.
N: She hesitates, scared of what she’s about to write next.
C: MARGARET
D: That maybe the truth is... There’s nobody even up there. There’s nobody listening.
E: V.O.
N: Something empties out of her eyes.
C: MARGARET
D: There’s only just me.
E: V.O.
S: INT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
N: Margaret walks to school by herself. She looks tiny. A tuft of dust blowing down the road.
S: INT. MR. BENEDICT’S CLASS - DAY
N: Students drop BOUND BOOKLETS into Mr. Benedict’s INBOX. Margaret waits at the edge of his desk as he finishes reading her LETTER. He looks up at her, worried for her.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Margaret...
N: A knot forms in her throat. She tries to swallow it away, but can’t. She rushes out of the room before anyone see her cry.
S: INT. DELANO SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Margaret barrels down the hallway, trying to outpace her emotions. A TEAR escapes. Then another. And another. She starts to RUN, makes a turn into--
S: INT. DELANO GIRLS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: She races by a GIRL AT THE SINK WASHING HER HANDS, ducks into the last stall, shuts the door, crouches down next to the toilet, THE TEARS COMING HARDER AND FASTER NOW. She clamps a hand over her mouth, trying not to make a sound. She SOBS -- a SILENT, shaking little heap. The GIRL exits, the SOUND of the door shutting behind her. Finally in private, Margaret unclamps her hand, lets herself cry. She finishes and the bathroom becomes VERY STILL. She pulls in a long, slow breath, steadying herself. Presses her scrunch sleeves against her eyes to sop them up. Finally, she rises to her feet, exiting to--
S: EXT. DELANO SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: As she comes out the door, the LUNCH BELL RINGS. HUNDREDS of KIDS rush in from all directions. Margaret watches them for a moment. Then folds in with the crowd, CARRYING ON.
S: EXT. MORNINGBIRD LANE - LATER THAT DAY
N: Sun sinking behind the trees.
S: INT. SIMONS’ DINING ROOM - SAME
N: CLOSE UP: The LATCH on the UNDERSIDE OF THE DINING ROOM TABLE that holds in the EXTRA LEAF. Two FINGERS reach into frame, popping it open. Barb struggles to lift the HEAVY WOOD PIECE from the center of the table, drags it across the carpet, leans it against the wall. She pushes the two side pieces back together to turn it back into a SMALL ROUND TABLE. She stares at it a beat. Her own family seemed to expand and contract just that fast. She takes a slow breath, trying to be okay with that. Behind her, the DOOR OPENS. Margaret walks in from school with a tired, far-off expression. Barb can relate.
C: BARBARA
D: Hi...
N: Margaret nods hello, heads for the stairs.
C: BARBARA
D: Hey. Wait... Come’re.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: I don’t feel like talking.
C: BARBARA
D: I know. I don’t either.
N: They just stand there. BARBARA (CONT'D)
C: BARBARA
D: I’m sorry for how things went. And... I know this past year has not been easy.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret doesn’t make eye contact. You got that right.
C: BARBARA
D: Wanna just sit for a minute?
E: CONT'D
N: Barbara gestures to the couch. Margaret isn’t sure. Barb takes a seat, hoping she’ll follow. Margaret hesitates, then joins her. They sit quietly beside each other a moment. Barb looks over at Margaret, Margaret looks over at her. The moment is ripe.
C: BARBARA
D: I want to say something encouraging right now, but nothing’s coming to me.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret cracks a tiny smile. Looks down. Barb’s heart aches seeing her like this.
C: BARBARA
D: It gets tiring trying so hard all the time, doesn’t it.
E: CONT'D lovingly
N: Margaret nods. Yes. Yes, it does. Barb nods back, knowing the feeling well. She loops her arm around her. Their heads tip together ever-so-slightly.
S: EXT. NEW JERSEY - JUNE / EARLY EVENING
N: Summer again. Trees swaying in a warm breeze. Emerald green grass. Sprinkler mist sparkling in the sun.
S: EXT. DELANO SCHOOL / 6TH GRADE FAREWELL CARNIVAL - SAME
N: GLOWING PAPER LANTERNS strung up over the blacktop. BOOTHS set up with FOOD and GAMES. Margaret leans together with Janie, Nancy, and Gretchen in front of a “CONGRATS GRADUATES” PHOTO BACKDROP. She’s a little better now, but something is missing from her smile. MR. BENEDICT snaps their PICTURE.
C: NANCY
D: Junior high, woo!!! Ooh the fish bowl game is open! Let’s go, come on, I’m going first!
E: then
N: Nancy breaks their huddle, takes off running. Gretchen and Janie run after her. Margaret almost falls in with them, then decides against it. She just can’t go along with Nancy’s ever whim anymore.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Doing ok, Margaret?
N: She looks over at Mr. Benedict. He’s checking in with her after what happened.
C: MARGARET
D: Yeah. Thanks, Mr. Benedict. You were a good 6th grade teacher.
C: MR. BENEDICT
D: Oh, I don’t know about that. Still ironing out a lotta kinks...
N: But Margaret smiles, meaning it. Mr. Benedict bows his head, the compliment getting in. Someone TURNS UP the MUSIC on the stereo system. A BUNCH OF KIDS make a run for the chalk-drawn DANCE FLOOR. Margaret watches them dance for a moment. Then something just beyond them catches her eye: LAURA DANKER, standing by herself as always. Margaret leaves Mr. Benedict, walks up to her.
C: MARGARET
D: Hey.
N: Laura looks over, surprised someone’s talking to her.
C: MARGARET
D: You wanna come dance?
E: CONT'D
N: Laura hesitates, not sure if she’s for real. Margaret looks at her, earnest. Laura weighs whether to trust it. She takes the leap. They head over to the dance floor, start to dance together. OVER AT THE FISH BOWL GAME -- Nancy hogs the game, Gretchen nagging for a turn. Janie looks around for Margaret. Spots her across the way, dancing with Laura. Surprised, she watches them a sec. They look like they’re having more fun than she is. She looks over at Nancy and Gretchen bickering, decides to join Margaret and Laura. The 3 of them DANCE in a little circle, at the beginning of something...
S: EXT. SMALL ART SCHOOL - SAME
N: A small BRICK BUILDING nestled on MAIN STREET.
S: INT. SMALL ART SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS
N: CLOSE UP: A PAINTING OF A BOWL OF FRUIT, still in progress. A YOUNG GUY adds a shadow under a pear.
C: BARBARA
D: Nice job on the shading, you might try a wash to blend this area here.
N: The guy nods, grateful. Barb moves on to the next student.
S: EXT. SMALL ART SCHOOL / MAIN STREET - LATER
N: Barb walks to her car after work. Mrs. Wheeler comes down the sidewalk with some shopping bags.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Oh hey Barbara!
C: BARBARA
D: Oh, hi Jan.
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: I was just gonna call you! Could you believe it about the stars? Jeez, I guess everything’s a “fire hazard” these days.
N: Mrs. Wheeler shakes her head at the dumb rule.
C: BARBARA
D: Yeah...
C: MRS. WHEELER
D: Anyway, listen, we’re already forming committees at the junior high and I can think of at least three you’d be perfect for if you’ll sign up?
N: Barb smiles, nods.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh, yeah, that sounds great and I’d love to, but...
N: Beat. How does she put this?
C: BARBARA
D: ...I don’t want to.
E: CONT'D shrugs, warmly
N: Barb smiles again, apologetic. Mrs. Wheeler blinks, taken aback by the honesty.
C: BARBARA
D: I’ll see you later though, okay Jan?
E: CONT'D
N: Barb slides into her car, waving goodbye. As she spins around to back out, she has a private moment celebrating her tiny victory on the road to self-acceptance.
S: INT. SIMON’S KITCHEN - DAY
N: Margaret is on the PHONE with Sylvia (in her APARTMENT).
C: SYLVIA
D: I’m gonna write you so many letters. So many letters the mailman says, that’s it, too many letters.
E: O.S.
C: MARGARET
D: Good. Great.
C: SYLVIA
D: Have the best time, Sugar, we’ll see you when you get back.
N: Sylvia looks over at Mr. Binamin sitting drinking coffee in his pajamas. He MOVED IN with her.
C: MARGARET
D: ‘kay, bye Grandma.
N: Margaret hangs up, goes into the LIVING ROOM, where Barb some last items into her CAMP TRUNK, filled to the brim. (Behind her, we see the living room now includes a DEDICATED CORNER for her painting stuff).
C: BARBARA
D: Alright, think that’s everything. Now let’s see if we can close it.
N: Barb swings the lid down. Margaret climbs on top of it, using all her weight to push it. Barb secures the latches. They high-five.
C: BARBARA
D: Almost like we’ve done this before.
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret hears the LAWN MOWER START UP, looks out the front window. Barb’s figured out she likes Moose.
C: BARBARA
D: We owe him for the month. You wanna give it to him?
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret turns to Barb, her face lit up, thankful for the excuse.
S: EXT. SIMONS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Margaret finds Moose making laps with the mower, singing Erie Canal to himself.
C: MARGARET
D: Hey Moose...
N: Moose waves. She holds up the BILLS. He turns the mower off. They walk towards each other.
C: MOOSE
D: Thanks.
E: taking the money
C: MARGARET
D: Sure...
N: She just nods and smiles for a moment.
C: MARGARET
D: Well, have a good summer since I won’t see you for a while.
E: CONT'D
C: MOOSE
D: Oh? When are you going?
C: MARGARET
D: Camp. New Hamsphire. Leaving later today...
C: MOOSE
D: Oh. Well. Have fun.
C: MARGARET
D: Yeah.
C: MOOSE
D: And... send me a post card maybe.
N: A dumb grin forms on Margaret’s face, not expecting that.
C: MARGARET
D: Really? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I will.
N: Moose smiles, walks back over to this mower. Margaret turns around and heads back towards the house, glowing.
S: INT. SIMONS’ LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Margaret climbs the stairs two-by-two, grinning to herself. She skips down the hall, ducks into--
S: INT. MARGARET’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: She pulls down her shorts, sits down to pee, still smiling, replaying what he said. She gets up front the toilet, suddenly FREEZES, seeing something. Her eyes get as big as dinner plates. For a second, she can’t breathe. Then--
C: MARGARET
D: Mom! MOMMMMMMMMMMM!!!
N: BARB is DOWN THE HALL, putting some TOWELS into the LINEN CLOSET. She startles, rushes down the hall, worried. Sticks her head into the BATHROOM.
C: BARBARA
D: What is it? What’s wrong?
N: Margaret looks up at her, can’t believe what she’s about to say.
C: MARGARET
D: I got it.
N: Barbara doesn’t know what she means for a se.
C: BARBARA
D: What?
C: MARGARET
D: My period, I got my period!
N: As she says the words aloud, she starts to LAUGH AND CRY AT THE SAME TIME, short-circuiting from all the emotions. This is wonderful! This is awful! It’s such a relief! I’m so scared! I’m finally growing up! Oh god I’m not a kid anymore.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh my god.
N: Barb starts to choke up too, then LAUGHS, feeling silly about all these emotions.
C: BARBARA
D: Here, wait a minute, I’ll get the pads, I got you some just in case, I was going to sneak ‘em in your camp trunk when you weren’t looking!
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret laughs. Barb hurries to get the BOX from a HALL CABINET, comes back with the PAD for Margaret.
C: BARBARA
D: Here. Okay, so this is how you do it, you pull this thing off and there’s a sticky part that goes--
E: CONT'D
N: Margaret grabs the pad away.
C: MARGARET
D: I already know! I’ve been practicing for two months!
N: They both start laughing again.
C: BARBARA
D: Okay. I guess I’ll wait outside then.
N: Barb closes the door, steps into the HALLWAY to give Margaret privacy. INSIDE THE BATHROOM-- Margaret peels the paper off the pad, presses it against her underwear, pulls up her shorts. She can’t believe she’s doing this for real. She turns to look at herself in the mirror. Thrilled and a little scared by the new person staring back at her. She draws in a breath, letting it all settle in. Then, a tiny little thought arrives. It hovers there, crumb-sized. Her eyes tick up to the ceiling. THE SCREEN GOES BLACK. We hang for a moment in the darkness. Then:
C: MARGARET
D: Are you still there God? It’s me, Margaret.
E: V.O.
N: END CREDIT MUSIC BEGINS. THE END.
