N: SUMMER CAMP in the CATSKILLS. Sunlit. Glorious. Ten thousand

N: MARGARET SIMON (11), standing on a DOCK in her BATHING SUIT,
N: spindly arms and legs, nose peeling from a sunburn, hair
N: swept up in a jumble of bobby pins, growing out from a bob.
0: 
N: She lets out a GOOFY REBEL-YELL and   does a AWKWARD JUMP into
N: the LAKE, arms and legs flailing. A   DOZEN 11-YEAR-OLD GIRLS
N: do their own funny lake-jumps after   her, one after another,
N: like dominos. They all come up from   the water, LAUGHING.
0: 
N: A COLLAGE OF IMAGES: The girls singing CAMP SONGS, firing and
N: misfiring ARROWS, clopping through a stream ON HORSEBACK,
N: whispering in BUNK BEDS, blowing out MARSHMALLOWS by a
N: CAMPFIRE, all squeezed together with their arms around each
N: other by a “CAMP EAGLE LAKE” SIGN.
0: 
N: A BRIGHT LIGHT FLASHES, capturing a PHOTO of it. All of the
N: girls grinning, carefree, unaware yet of their bodies, their
N: crooked teeth, the dorky haircuts they’ll soon regret. KIDS.
0: 
N: They break apart. Margaret and the other campers HUG and do
N: stupid handshakes goodbye.
0: 
N: She climbs aboard the NEW YORK-BOUND CAMP BUS among a LINE OF

N: Margaret gives more goodbye-hugs as she makes her way out of

0: 
N: BARBARA SIMON (30’s) -- hair frizzed from the heat, anxious
N: to please, polite to a fault -- weaves through the crowd,

N: fingers stained with paint, a wrist coil key chain jammed
N: with too many keys.
0: 
N: Margaret runs over, HUGGING her. Barbara squeezes her hard.

D:           with you. Okay, now your turn.
0: 
N: They all take out paper and get busy writing. Nancy slides a
N: NOTE to Margaret: “Secret club meeting today. 3pm, my house.
N: NO SOCKS!!!”
0: 
C:                     NANCY
D:           Pass it on.

N: Margaret nods dutifully, passing it to Janie.

S: INT. SYLVIA’S NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY
0: 
N: Sylvia finishes watering TWO LITTLE BAMBOO PLANTS sitting in
N: her window sill, then sits at the kitchen table, not sure
N: what to do next. She looks at the phone, then looks at her
N: watch. Margaret’s not home for several hours.

S: INT. SIMONS’ HOUSE / VARIOUS - THAT AFTERNOON
0: 
N: The KITCHEN is done now. Barb finishes wiping the counters,
N: goes into THE LIVING ROOM to see what’s left to do.
0: 
N: Just one BIG STACK OF BOXES remain, carrying all her ART
N: STUFF. PAINT BRUSHES, PAINTS, CANVASES, HER OLD ARTWORK. She
N: pulls out a few of her PAINTINGS. Eyeing some of the older
N: ones, she’s surprised by her reaction to them: She likes her
N: own work. She’s talented. Two endorsements she always
N: hesitates to give herself. She leans a few of them against
N: the walls to be hung up later.
0: 
N: Then glances around the room, trying to figure out where to
N: put all of her art supplies. She opens the HALL CLOSET:
N: already stuffed. Peaks in the LAUNDRY ROOM: Too small.
0: 
0: 
S: INT. SIMONS GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: She slides the ART BOXES into a CORNER next to a RUSTY FAN
N: and a BOX OF YEARBOOKS. Something about putting this stuff
N: here makes her a little sad. The end of a long-held part of
N: herself. But she brushes off the feeling, goes back into --

S: INT. SIMONS’ LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: As Barb comes into the room, she suddenly notices something
N: hadn’t until this moment, FROWNS.
0: 
N: The TATTERED LIVING ROOM SET from their New York apartment
N: has seen better days, and also looks RIDICULOUSLY SMALL in
N: their vast new suburban den. Just comically out of
N: proportion. Hmmm. This will definitely not work.
0: 
N: The PHONE RINGS. Barb crosses get it.

N: INTERCUT with Sylvia at her apartment, dusting her furniture
N: to pass the time.

D:           It’s 3:32.

D:           I know.

C:                     SYLVIA
D:           You said she’s out at 3:15 and the
D:           walk is 10 minutes.
0: 
C:                     BARBARA
D:           Yes, she’ll probably be here any
D:           minute.
0: 
C:                     SYLVIA
D:           Okay... I’ll... just wait I guess.
0: 
N: A beat as Sylvia waits for the few minutes to pass. Then she
N: realizes she should probably small-talk with Barbara.
0: 
C:                     SYLVIA (CONT'D)
D:           Um, so, how are you?
0: 
C:                     BARBARA
D:           Good. I’m good. How are you?
0: 
C:                     SYLVIA
D:           Oh fine... Today I read that when
D:           you don’t have any loved ones
D:           around your life expectancy drops
D:           drastically. But, you know, I’ve
D:           had a good run...
0: 
N: Barb can’t help but laugh at her guilt trip.
0: 
C:                      BARBARA
E:                (laughing)
D:           Oh Sylvia, come on.
0: 
N: Sylvia’s not kidding. The door opens behind Barb and Margaret   *
N: hurries in.                                                     *

C:                      BARBARA (CONT'D)
D:           Oh, here she is, she’s home.
E:               (holds out the phone)
D:           Grandma’s on the phone for you.
0: 
N: Margaret instantly perks up, drops her bag, runs to grab it.

D:           okay? You can tell me the truth.
0: 
C:                      MARGARET
D:           It’s actually not as bad as I
D:           thought...
0: 
C:                     SYLVIA
D:           Really? That’s wonderful news...
0: 
N: Sylvia looks crestfallen, secretly hoping it’d be bad enough
N: they’d all move back.
0: 
C:                     SYLVIA (CONT'D)
D:           Well, anyway, I was thinking you
D:           could come visit the weekend after
D:           next, I’ll get us tickets to a
D:           show, you can spend the night,
D:           we’ll do a little slumber party,
D:           that’d be so fun, right?
0: 
C:                     MARGARET
D:           Oooh yeah, I’d love that!
0: 
C:                     SYLVIA
D:           I knew you would. Great. I’ll tell
D:           your mother it was your idea, okay?
D:           I’ll call you tomorrow.

N: Margaret agrees, hangs up.

D:           You just got home, I haven’t even
D:           heard about your day.

C:                     BARBARA
D:           Well just at least give me one word

0: 
0: 
N: A sound indicating “I don’t know, maybe it’ll be okay, maybe
N: it’ll be a truly hellish nightmare, we have to see.” Barbara
N: gets her meaning.
0: 
C:                     BARBARA
D:           Fair enough. Okay, go ahead.

S: INT. NANCY WHEELERS BACK PORCH - A LITTLE LATER
0: 
N: Nancy, Gretchen and Janie sit around the patio table eating
N: Oreos, LAUGHING. Margaret arrives through the back door,
N: wishing she weren’t the last one to get here.
0: 
C:                     MARGARET
D:           Hi...
0: 
N: She finds a seat at the table, reticent.

C:                     NANCY
D:           We were just talking about Laura
D:           Danker again.
0: 
C:                     GRETCHEN
D:           Yeah, how she got even bigger over
D:           the summer.
0: 
N: Gretchen cups her hands to show the size of Laura’s chest.
N: Margaret quickly nods in agreement, trying to catch up to
N: where they are in the conversation.
0: 
C:                     MARGARET
D:           Oh. Yeah, she looks so grown up...
0: 
N: Margaret crosses her legs, trying to seem cool. Her SHOE
N: falls off. She quickly leans down and puts it back on.
0: 
C:                     NANCY
D:           She’s worn a bra since 4th grade.
D:           I bet you a dollar she already gets
D:           her period too.
0: 
N: Margaret gets a little uncomfortable at the word “period”.
N: Janie does too. They share a look.
0: 
C:                     GRETCHEN
D:           Well I know for sure somebody in
D:           our school does.

0: 
C:                     NANCY
D:           Did you get it yet, Margaret?
0: 
N: Suddenly they’re all looking at her, waiting for a response.

C:                      MARGARET
E:                    (beat)
D:           Uh... not yet. Have you?
0: 
C:                     NANCY
D:           No, none of us have yet.
0: 
N: She couldn’t be more relieved. Nancy bangs her COKE CAN on
N: the table like a gavel.
0: 
C:                     NANCY (CONT'D)
D:           Alright, let’s get down to
D:           business. First, this secret club
D:           is a secret. You can’t tell anyone
D:           what happens here. Ever.
0: 
C:                     GRETCHEN
D:           Duh.
0: 
C:                     NANCY
D:           Second, if you want to be in it,
D:           you have to follow the club’s
D:           rules.
0: 
C:                     JANIE
D:           What kind of rules?
0: 
C:                      NANCY
D:           I don’t know, I haven’t thought of
D:           them yet. Oh, I just got one.
E:               (twiddles eyebrows)
D:           If you’re in the club, you have to
D:           wear a bra.
0: 
N: The energy in the room immediately shifts. Margaret crosses
N: her arms over her non-existent chest.
0: 
C:                     GRETCHEN
D:           I have one. If you get your period,
D:           you have to tell us about it.
0: 
C:                     NANCY
D:           Oooh, yes. Every detail. Especially
D:           how it feels.

0: 
C:                     JANIE
D:           Mine is... what if we all keep a
D:           notebook of the boys we like?
0: 
N: They all love that idea too.
0: 
C:                      MARGARET
E:                 (piggy-backing)
D:           Yeah, and, and we have to show it
D:           to each other at each meeting and
D:           we can’t ever lie.
0: 
N: The room tingles with excitement at the prospect of this kind
N: of sharing. Margaret smiles, starting to feel like part of
N: the group. She’s at the beginning of a whole new chapter.

D:           her real name was Norma? Then a guy
D:           looks at her and goes “you don’t
D:           look like a Norma, you look like a
D:           Peggy” and she goes “Okay.”

N: But Margaret’s not listening. She’s studying something, her

N: REVEAL: THE JC PENNEY CATALOGUE, opened to the BRA SECTION.
N: She has it tucked inside her HISTORY BOOK, angled so nobody
N: but her can see it.

0: 
N: Barb is in THE KITCHEN looking at a PHOTO in a RECIPE BOOK: A
N: JUICY GOLDEN BROWN CHICKEN nestled in a clump of crispy
N: potatoes. She looks over at HER OWN VERSION: A LIMP GRAY
N: WATERY CARCASS floating next to BURNT BLACK POTATOES. It’s

N: Barb freezes. Margaret covers her face, mortified. Barb turns
N: the LIGHT BACK ON, a little dumbstruck. Unprepared for this
N: conversation. She treads lightly.

D:           Okay... Uh, you...you think you
D:           need one?

D:           to start sooner than you have to.
D:           But if you want one, we’ll get one.

N: expecting this.
0: 
C:                     MR. BENEDICT

N: Benedict gestures to Margaret.
0: 
C:                     MR. BENEDICT (CONT'D)
D:           Excuse me, Margaret, may I talk to

0: 
C:                     MARGARET
D:           Did I... do something wrong?
0: 
N: He looks up, suddenly seeing how nervous she is.
0: 
C:                     MR. BENEDICT
D:           Oh! No. No-no-no-no. Sorry, did I
D:           give that impression? Rookie
D:           mistake. Please, relax. Would you
D:           like anything? Water? Candy Corn?
0: 
N: He offers her his little JAR OF CANDY CORN.
0: 
C:                     MARGARET
D:           No...thank you.
0: 
N: Margaret loosens a little. He takes a piece of CANDY CORN for
N: himself. She watches him chew it for a moment.
0: 
C:                     MR. BENEDICT
D:           I’m just having little chats with

D:           research projects to answer
D:           questions, perhaps guide you

D:           Oh.

D:           I read your getting-to-know you
D:           paper, and noticed under the “I
D:           hate” section, you wrote “religious
D:           holidays”? Which I found curious...
0: 
N: Margaret shifts in her seat, put on the spot.
0: 
C:                     MR. BENEDICT (CONT'D)
D:           If you don’t want to share why, you

0: 
C:                     MARGARET
D:           No, I, uh... I guess I just don’t

D:           My dad is Jewish and my mom is
D:           Christian, so instead of picking
D:           which religion I am, they just
D:           decided I wouldn’t have one, and
D:           I’ll choose when I grow up...
0: 
C:                     MR. BENEDICT
D:           Ah, I see. And have you given that
D:           much thought?
0: 
C:                     MARGARET
D:           Not really... My grandma wants me

0: 
C:                     MR. BENEDICT
D:           And your other grandparents want

0: 
C:                     MARGARET
D:           I’ve never seen my other
D:           grandparents. They live in Ohio.

0: 
C:                     MR. BENEDICT
D:           Interesting...
0: 
N: His curiosity begins to pique her own. That is pretty
N: interesting now that she thinks about it.
0: 
C:                     MR. BENEDICT (CONT'D)
D:           Well, if I may suggest it, religion
D:           could make a very compelling
D:           research topic for you...

N: weighing it.
0: 
C:                     BARBARA
D:           Because...we just don’t. It’s a

D:           Why can’t you just tell me now?
0: 
N: Margaret looks at her, really wanting to know. Barb can tell
N: she’s not getting out of this.
0: 
C:                     BARBARA
D:           Look, I just don’t want you to be

N: Now Margaret is even more interested. Barb releases a breath,
N: has out with it.
0: 
C:                     BARBARA (CONT'D)
D:           The truth is... we don’t see my

D:           My mom and dad are very, very
D:           devout Christians, and before you
D:           were born, when your dad and I
D:           first fell in love, they told me
D:           they would never accept a Jewish
D:           son-in-law, and that if I wanted to
D:           marry him and ruin my life, that
D:           was my business...but I wouldn’t be
D:           their daughter any longer.
0: 
N: Retelling this story, Barb can’t help but feel those old
N: emotions rising up in her.
0: 
C:                     MARGARET
D:           But...you are their daughter.

N: this more clearly.
0: 
C:                     BARBARA
D:           What I mean is that they... they
D:           decided they didn’t want me in
D:           their life anymore.
0: 
N: It’s difficult to say it so plainly.

D:           Mom...

N: She moves towards Barb, wrapping her arms around her to
N: comfort her. Barb feels herself choke up a little, then wills
N: it back, not wanting Margaret to take this on, uncomfortable
N: feeling their parent-child dynamic reversed.
0: 
N: Barb gives her a little pat, reassuring Margaret she’s okay.

C:                     BARBARA

D:           I mean, what the heck, God? How
D:           could you let this happen? Religion
D:           is supposed to bring people

N: one. Margaret is frozen in her spot. He walks past her OUT OF
N: THE BATHROOM.

C:                     GRETCHEN
D:           Well that doesn’t mean anything.
0: 
C:                     MARGARET
D:           Just tell us how it happened.
0: 
C:                     JANIE
D:           Yeah, start from the beginning.
0: 
C:                     GRETCHEN
D:           Well I was sitting there at dinner
D:           and I felt something dripping from
D:           me. So I went to the bathroom, and
D:           pulled down my pants, and that’s
D:           when I saw the blood. So I called
D:           my mom and showed her. But she only
D:           had tampons, no pads, so she had to
D:           run to the store.
0: 
C:                     JANIE
D:           What’d you do in the meantime?
0: 
C:                     GRETCHEN
D:           I stuck a washcloth in my pants.
0: 
C:                     NANCY
D:           Ew, no you didn’t!
0: 
C:                     GRETCHEN
D:           An old wash cloth. Not like one we
D:           use all the time.
0: 
C:                      MARGARET
E:               (moving this along)
D:           Okay, so go on, then what.
0: 
C:                     GRETCHEN
D:           So then my mom came home with the
D:           pads and I put one on, and,
D:           well...that was the whole thing.
0: 
C:                     NANCY
D:           The whole thing? You haven’t even
D:           told us the good stuff yet!
0: 
C:                     GRETCHEN
D:           I’ve told you everything.
0: 
C:                     NANCY
D:           But, like, what does it feel like?
0: 0:                                                            80.
0: 
0: 
C:                     GRETCHEN
D:           It feels like... nothing. Sometimes
D:           like leaking? It doesn’t hurt. I
D:           had some cramps last night, not too
D:           bad. My cousin said it kinda has a
D:           smell, but I haven’t noticed it
D:           yet.
0: 
C:                     MARGARET
D:           It does? Like what?
0: 
C:                     GRETCHEN
D:           She said it kinda smells like the
D:           monkey bars.
0: 
C:                     NANCY
D:           The monkey bars?
0: 
N: They all look around, trying to remember that smell. Janie
N: looks suddenly grief-stricken.
0: 
C:                      JANIE
E:               (memory tainted forever)
D:           I used to love the monkey bars...
0: 
N: Margaret is mesmerized.

C:                     MARGARET
D:           Do you feel older now? Like more
D:           mature?
0: 
C:                      GRETCHEN
E:                (utterly sincere)
D:           Oh yeah. I don’t know how to
D:           explain it, and you won’t
D:           understand until you get it, but I
D:           feel like everything has changed
D:           for me. I just feel different.
E:                   (wistful)
D:           Yeah...
0: 
N: Margaret’s insides twist with envy, wishing so badly she
N: could feel that feeling.

N: She lays back on her carpet, exhausted. Something in the room

N: slams it shut.

0: 
C:                     MARGARET
D:           It’s not a big deal. It’s just so
D:           we’re ready, just in case.
0: 
N: But Margaret is extremely nervous too. She gathers her
N: courage, plucks a BOX off the shelf. Janie wills herself to
N: take one too.
0: 
C:                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
D:           Okay. Come on.

0: 
C:                     MARGARET
D:           No. We’re doing it.
0: 
N: They walk up, set their TWO BOXES OF PADS on the CONVEYER
N: BELT as casually as possible. The TEENAGE CLERK looks down at
N: the pads, then up at them. They fold their arms, look away.
0: 
N: He presses the button to roll the pads closer to him. It’s
N: THE SLOWEST CONVEYER BELT IN HISTORY.
0: 
N: Margaret and Janie watch, sweating, as the pads inch slowwwly
N: by. Margaret finally can’t take it, grabs some TIC TACS,
N: tosses them down with the pads so they aren’t alone.

S: EXT. DRUG STORE - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: Margaret and Janie burst out of the store, RUNNING AS FAST AS

0: 
N: They stop at the corner, out of breath. Look at each other,
N: traumatized. Janie suddenly begins to LAUGH.
0: 
C:                     JANIE
D:           The Tic Tacs...
0:

N: Margaret turns it over in her hands. Squishes it. Smells it.
0: 
N: REVEAL: She’s crouched INSIDE HER CLOSET with the door
N: closed.
0: 
N: She peels off the paper strip, touches the sticky part a
N: couple times. Then stands up, yanking down her pants. She
N: hunches over, carefully sticking the pad in place. Then pulls
N: up her pants again, WALKS OUT OF THE CLOSET.
0: 
N: She moves around the ROOM, feeling it out. Stretches, kicks,
N: squats. It feels like wearing a small diaper.
0: 
N: Suddenly there’s KNOCK and the DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
0: 0:                                                            83.

C:                     MARGARET
D:           Oh. Uh, Nancy. Must be from her.
D:           They went for Lincoln’s birthday.
0: 
N: Barb cocks her head a little, sensing something’s off with
N: Margaret. She lets it go, hands her the post card, exits.
0: 
N: When the door closes, Margaret flips it over. Nancy’s written
N: just 3 words: I GOT IT!
0: 
N: Margaret’s mouth drops open. Her mood plummets. In one
N: spontaneous flurry, she tears up the card, hurls the pieces
N: into the trash can, KICKS it over.

N: until she’s right there in front of it. Then slowly,
N: anxiously, she opens it to see what’s inside.
0: 
N: A dark, empty space the size of a phone booth. Margaret
N: debates a moment, then decides to go in. She sits on the
N: small stool, pulls the door shut. She looks around the tiny
N: space, her breath held tight in her chest. Is this where God
N: is? In here?

C:                     MARGARET
D:           I’m the worst person who ever
D:           lived, God. I picked on Laura
D:           Danker just because I felt mean.
D:           Why did I do that? I’ve been
D:           looking for you, God. I looked for
D:           you in Temple, I looked for you in
D:           Church, and I looked for you just
D:           now when I went to confess. You
D:           weren’t there. I didn’t feel you at
D:           all. Why God? Why do I only feel
D:           you when I’m alone?

N: OVER AT THE FISH BOWL GAME --
0: 
N: Nancy hogs the game, Gretchen nagging for a turn. Janie looks
