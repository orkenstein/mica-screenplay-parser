M: CLOSE ON A BLOWN-UP PHOTO:
N: The GLOWERING FACE of DENNIS PRICE, 60’s, a CEO in a $3,000 suit. TILT DOWN to find the same glowering face wearing the same suit... only now he’s lying dead in his open coffin. This is his wake.
S: INT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY
N: A line of MOURNERS in businesswear pay their respects as they file past. We find RICK and LARRY at the hors d’oeuvres table.
C: RICK
D: Accounting?
C: LARRY
D: Human resources.
C: RICK
D: Right. Shame about Mr. Price.
C: LARRY
D: Yeah...
E: unconvincingly
C: RICK
D: What?
C: LARRY
D: No, nothing. He kinda made my life miserable.
E: then, quietly
C: RICK
D: Same! He was the meanest boss I ever had.
N: A woman, GLADYS, leans in.
C: GLADYS
D: Are you guys talking about Mr. Price?
C: RICK/LARRY
D: Uhhh...
C: GLADYS
D: ‘Cause I hated that guy.
C: LARRY
D: You too?
N: A few other EMPLOYEES join in.
C: EMPLOYEE #1
D: I don’t know anyone who liked him.
C: EMPLOYEE #2
D: I heard he stabbed his assistant with a letter opener because he brought him the wrong lunch.
N: Another guy pulls up his sleeve to show a SCAR on his arm.
C: EMPLOYEE #3
D: That was me!
C: GLADYS
D: He was so drunk with power. He’d fire you if you called him by his first name.
C: RICK
D: Well, I guess Dennis can’t fire us now!
N: They all laugh and toast to that. More and more people have joined their circle.
C: LARRY
D: Hey, show of hands? Who here hated this guy?
E: re: the coffin
N: Every hand goes up.
C: LARRY
D: Well, then let’s turn this funeral into a par-tay!
E: CONT'D
N: Someone cranks up CLUB MUSIC and the crowd begins to celebrate as Larry leans over Dennis’s body.
C: LARRY
D: See ya in hell, Dennis.
E: CONT'D
N: He slams shut the coffin lid as we MATCH CUT TO: DENNIS’S FACE. Only he’s alive.
S: INT. CEO’S OFFICE - DAY
N: He looks around the bland corner office, confused. He’s seated across the desk from an empty chair.
C: DENNIS
D: What is this? This isn’t my office.
N: A door opens and SATAN enters from his private bathroom. The prince of darkness is a slick, sharply dressed figure. Think Jon Hamm with fucked-up eyes.
C: SATAN
D: Sorry to keep you waiting. Blood of the innocent gives me reflux.
C: DENNIS
D: Who are you?
C: SATAN
D: Oh, I’m your boss. Pleasure.
N: He holds out his hand but Dennis ignores it.
C: DENNIS
D: I don’t have a boss, guy. I am the boss.
C: SATAN
D: Yeah, that ended when you fell off your yacht. And your crew decided not to notice. Let me show you your work area.
E: then
C: DENNIS
D: I’m not going any--
S: INT. A VAST FILE ROOM - DAY
N: Satan and Dennis are suddenly standing in the biggest, dankest file room you’ve ever seen.
C: DENNIS
D: --where. How did we--?
E: realizing
C: SATAN
D: Oh, here in Hell, we find it saves time just to be in the place we’re going, rather than all of that pesky getting there.
C: DENNIS
D: Did you say... Hell?
C: SATAN
D: Specifically your hell, Dennis. Your greatest fear is being a powerless underling. And that’s what you are now. Gonna need you to file all these papers.
N: He gestures to an infinite series of piles that stretch up to the ceiling in all directions.
C: SATAN
D: But the good news is, if you work hard and do your best, you only have to do this forever.
E: CONT'D
C: DENNIS
D: Really? And what’s to keep me from walking right out of here?
E: snarky
C: SATAN
D: Nothing, I suppose. There’s the door.
N: And with that, Dennis bolts through the door.
C: SATAN
D: Hellhounds! Sic ‘em!
E: CONT'D gleefully calling off
S: INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: Dennis finds himself in a massive office filled with infinite cubicles. He starts running down the hall passing identical GHOULISH EMPLOYEES that sit mindlessly at their desks. But something makes Dennis stop dead in his tracks. Fifty feet ahead of him stand THREE TERRIFYING HELLHOUNDS: PHOBOS, very dumb, MORPHOS, slightly less dumb, and leading the trio, BUB (think Rocket from “Guardians of the Galaxy”: cocky, quick-witted and surly... but with a soft side). They growl monstrously, their eyes glowing a demonic red.
C: DENNIS
D: Oh my God.
E: mortified
C: BUB
D: Hey! We don’t use that kinda language here.
N: Dennis darts into the rows of cubicles in an attempt to lose them. Morphos and Phobos race after him. But Bub hangs back. ON DENNIS as he crouches behind dividers and crawls under desks. He peers up to see the dogs sniffing around nearby. Dennis spots an elevator and army crawls toward it. While Phobos and Morphos search cluelessly around the room, Bub clambers up onto a file cabinet, giving him a bird’s eye view of the room. His eyes narrow as he sees Dennis. At last, Phobos and Morphos spot the man and BOLT toward him. But the elevator doors close just in time and the two dogs SLAM FACE-FIRST into it. Both dogs go down hard.
S: INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
C: DENNIS
D: Stupid dogs.
C: BUB
D: You got that right.
E: O.S.
N: Dennis turns to find Bub waiting for him in the elevator.
C: BUB
D: Phobos and Morphos couldn’t catch their own tails. Granted, their tails are pretty nubby, but you get what I mean.
E: CONT'D
N: And with that, Bub POUNCES on a terrified Dennis as we tilt up to see every floor the elevator goes to is “13.”
S: INT. HELL CONTROL ROOM - DAY
N: Phobos and Morphos stand opposite Satan with their ears back. Behind the Dark Lord we see countless monitors showing different HUMANS being tormented in their own person hells: a man in a room full of clowns, a woman in a dentist’s chair, a guy in a room filling with water. Another screen shows FOX News.
C: SATAN
D: What do you mean he escaped?! There is no escape.
C: MORPHOS
D: I’m telling you, boss. This Dennis guy is like some kinda ninja.
C: PHOBOS
D: I’ve never seen anyone move like that.
C: SATAN
D: He’s an overweight 65 year-old man!
C: MORPHOS
D: He’s had 65 years to hone his craft.
C: SATAN
D: You’re both incompetent. Why is it so hard to find a hellhound with a brain?
C: BUB
D: Where do you want me to put this?
E: O.S.
N: They turn to see Bub, dragging a disheveled, screaming Dennis by his ankle into the room.
C: SATAN
D: Now, there is a bad dog.
E: pleased
C: BUB
D: Just doing my job. Let me guess. They said he was like a ninja?
E: to Satan
C: SATAN
D: Yup.
C: BUB
D: We haven’t had a ninja down here in three hundred years, guys. But I know it’s hard for you to remember with all that muscle where your brains should be.
C: PHOBOS
D: I’ll show you my brain-- muscle-- wait. What did you say?
E: angrily
C: SATAN
D: Excellent work, Bub. As always. Why don’t you sleep inside the house tonight? I’ll throw a couple burglars on the grill for us.
C: BUB
D: Sweet! I’d love that.
E: thrilled
C: SATAN
D: Great.
N: Satan crosses off. Phobos and Morphos can barely contain their jealousy.
C: BUB
D: It’s times like this I wish I could form my paw into an “L.”
N: He grabs Dennis by the ankle again. The man resumes screaming as Bub drags him out.
S: INT. SATAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: A cold, modernist mansion with minimal furniture, sharp edges and polished concrete floor. Lots of Damien Hirst skull paintings. Satan sits in a lounge chair eating a questionable looking burger while Wagner’s “Flight of the Valkyrie” plays in the background. Bub eats his own dinner from a dog bowl.
C: SATAN
D: I don’t know about you, Bub, but I could listen to Wagner all day.
N: The piece ends and Satan claps. WE REVEAL that RICHARD WAGNER is sitting at the piano.
C: WAGNER
D: Thank you.
E: German accent
C: SATAN
D: Once again, Wagner. From the top.
C: WAGNER
D: Again?! I’ve written hundreds of pieces. Why is it always “Flight of the Valkyries.”
E: throwing up his hands
C: SATAN
D: Because that’s the only one I know. And it’s dope.
N: Wagner sighs and begins playing again. Bub glances up at Satan and gathers his courage.
C: BUB
D: Hey, boss, I was thinking. Maybe I could... sit up in the chair with you?
C: SATAN
D: What?
C: BUB
D: I don’t know. You could scratch my ears or rub my belly? Nothing crazy.
C: SATAN
D: Why would I do that?
C: BUB
D: Well, ‘cause you like me...
E: losing confidence
C: SATAN
D: I never said I liked you. I don’t like anyone.
C: BUB
D: But you said I did a good job.
C: SATAN
D: And that’s why I keep you around. You do your job. Nothing more.
C: BUB
D: Right, yeah. Of course.
E: covering
C: SATAN
D: You’re starting to sound like a mortal, Bub. Are you looking for “love”?
C: BUB
D: What?! No way!
C: SATAN
D: Because only mortals crave an emotion as weak as that.
C: BUB
D: Well, that’s not me. I don’t swing that way. I mean there was this one time when I was a pup where I experimented with some mortal stuff, but everyone goes through that...
N: Satan regards Bub, a bit concerned.
C: BUB
D: Watch this. I’m gonna bite Wagner.
E: CONT'D
N: He crosses over and CHOMPS down on the composer’s leg.
C: WAGNER
D: Ow!
C: SATAN
D: Keep playing! Louder!
N: Wagner weeps quietly as he resumes playing. Satan claps his hands gleefully as Bub continues biting. The dog is relieved that his master has forgotten his odd behavior. WE MOVE OUTSIDE THE WINDOW to
S: EXT. HELLSCAPE - CONTINUOUS
N: Satan’s Neutra-style house sits on the peak of a nightmarish mountain overlooking a Hieronymus Bosch-like hellscape. Phobos and Morphos peer in at the seemingly idyllic scene.
C: PHOBOS
D: Never lets us bite Wagner.
C: MORPHOS
D: Never lets us in the house!
C: PHOBOS
D: I’m sick of Bub making us look bad.
C: MORPHOS
D: We’re gonna have to get better or Satan’s gonna fire us. With real fire.
C: PHOBOS
D: Honestly, dog, I don’t know if I can get any better. I think I’m maxed out.
C: MORPHOS
D: Same. I am not special. Hey, we wouldn’t have to get better than Bub if there was no Bub.
E: then
C: PHOBOS
D: We can’t kill him, Phobos. He’s immortal.
C: MORPHOS
D: What if we send him through the portal? Boom. He’s out of our fur.
C: PHOBOS
D: But that’s Satan’s portal. He’s the only one who uses it.
C: MORPHOS
D: If Satan told you to jump off a cliff, would you?
C: PHOBOS
D: He has told me to. And I did it. And it hurt.
C: MORPHOS
D: Look, we’re hellhounds. We’re not supposed to play by the rules. And what’s more “not playing by the rules” than using a portal we’re not supposed to use to send a dog who’s better than us at our job to another plane of existence?
C: PHOBOS
D: Well, when you put it that way... I’m confused.
C: MORPHOS
D: Just follow my lead.
S: INT. SATAN’S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Bub is asleep by the fire. His legs run in his sleep.
C: BUB
D: ...can’t outrun me, Stalin... I’m gonna get ya...
E: mumbling in his sleep
C: MORPHOS
D: PSSST!
E: O.S.
N: Bub wakes up to see Morphos and Phobos tapping on the window.
C: BUB
D: What do you want?
C: MORPHOS
D: We’ve got a runaway.
N: Bub sighs and crosses to them.
C: BUB
D: Another one?
C: PHOBOS
D: Little guy. Fast. Like a--
C: BUB
D: Let me guess: a ninja?
N: Phobos nods sheepishly.
C: MORPHOS
D: If Satan finds out we messed up again, we’re finished. We need your help, Bub.
C: BUB
D: Why would I help you losers?
C: MORPHOS
D: Look, we know this is Hell and we’re supposed to be mean to each other and not care about anyone but ourselves--
C: PHOBOS
D: --and we know you’re better at this job than we probably ever will be.
C: BUB
D: True.
C: MORPHOS
D: But there might come a day when something goes wrong for you and you need our help. This way we’d owe you that.
C: PHOBOS
D: So you’re not really helping us. You’re helping yourself in the future.
C: BUB
D: Hmm. For once, you guys are making sense. I’ll do it--
C: MORPHOS
D: Great!
C: BUB
D: --if you let me pee on you.
C: MORPHOS/PHOBOS
D: What?
C: BUB
D: I pee on things that I own. And since I own you now, I gotta pee on you. That’s just how it works.
N: Morphos and Phobos exchange a resigned look.
C: PHOBOS
D: You’re messed up.
C: BUB
D: I know.
S: EXT. HELL DESERT - DAY
N: Bub grins as he walks beside a wet and unhappy looking Morphos and Phobos. Around them, craggy salt flats stretch in all directions. Up ahead, a BEAM OF ENERGY FLOWS UPWARD FROM A CRATER in the ground, disappearing into the clouds above.
C: BUB
D: Where is this guy? All I see is Satan’s portal.
C: MORPHOS
D: I’m almost sure he headed this way.
C: PHOBOS
D: Maybe he’s hiding down there.
C: BUB
D: If you let him escape into the portal, there’s nothing I can do. You’re screwed.
N: He looks over the edge of the crater and peers down at the energy flow. Morphos and Phobos share an evil look.
C: MORPHOS
D: No, Bub. You’re screwed.
N: Bub turns back just in time to see the two dogs charging toward him.
C: BUB
D: Wait!
N: It’s too late. They slam into Bub. He falls backwards into the flowing energy which catches him up and yanks him violently into the sky.
C: BUB
D: HELP!
E: CONT'D
C: PHOBOS
D: Who owns who now?!
N: There’s a beat.
C: MORPHOS
D: This won’t totally feel like a win until I wash his pee off me.
S: INT. SPACE BETWEEN WORLDS - MOMENTS LATER
N: Traveling through the wind tunnel-like portal, Bub screams. His body slowly morphs into that of a MORTAL DOG.
T: MATCH CUT TO:
N: A MOVIE SCREEN It’s the scene from “The Goonies” where the group helplessly slides down the underground tunnel. PULL BACK TO SEE we are in
S: EXT. TAR PIT PARK - DUSK
N: A pleasant city park located in the heart of the small town of HOPEWELL JUNCTION. A large group of PEOPLE on blankets watch “The Goonies” on a screen. Several yards away, a low fence cordons off a steaming TAR PIT. Several large FIBERGLASS DINOSAURS stand beside it.
C: TOMÀS
D: Look, girls, they show movies in the park.
E: O.S.
S: INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS
N: TOMÀS (40’s) drives. He’s a nice, positive guy but there’s something sad in his eyes. With him are his two daughters: GRACE (15) moody and sarcastic, dressed in black, blue highlights in her hair, and JENNI (12) eager to please, sits shotgun, a hamster cage on her lap. The van is packed with their belongings.
C: GRACE
D: Nothing better than sitting on the ground watching a movie I’ve seen a million times with bad sound and picture.
C: TOMÀS
D: Fair enough. They’ve also got tar pits here.
C: JENNI
D: Whoa, cool! Did dinosaurs drown in there?
C: GRACE
D: Yup. And so did the women they accused of being witches in the 1600’s.
C: TOMÀS
D: No, really? How do you know that?
C: GRACE
D: When you told us we were moving to a town in the middle of nowhere, I did some research. Y’know you can’t buy beer here on a Sunday?
C: TOMÀS
D: Why does that matter?
E: suspicious
C: GRACE
D: It doesn’t. I’m just saying.
C: TOMÀS
D: Look, I know this is hard. I know it’s been a bad year. But as long as we’re all together, we’ll always be home. Right, Sebastian?
E: to Jenni’s hamster
C: JENNI
D: Right, Dad!
E: as Sebastian
C: GRACE
D: We’re not all together.
E: to herself
S: EXT. TAR PIT PARK - SAME
N: A hipster couple in their 20’s, ENID and FINN, watch “The Goonies.”
C: ENID
D: Can you hear anything they’re saying?
E: re: the movie
C: FINN
D: Not a word. Hey, Enid?
E: then
C: ENID
D: Yeah?
C: FINN
D: Listen, it’s only been eight months since we met, but the second we were partnered up in hot yoga, I knew I didn’t want to be sweated on by any other woman.
N: He takes a knee and opens a ring box. There’s an ALMOND inside.
C: FINN
D: I know this is just an almond but I’d like you to hold onto it until I can get my bamboo clothing company off the ground and then I’ll buy you the ring you deserve.
E: CONT'D
C: ENID
D: Oh, Finn.
C: FINN
D: Will you marry me, Enid?
N: But before she can answer, there’s a commotion as BUB FLIES OUT OF THE TAR PIT/PORTAL and lands, covered in tar, on their blanket. Finn and Enid find themselves splattered with black goo.
C: FINN
D: My almond!
E: CONT'D looking around
N: Bub does his best to shake off the tar, splattering them even more. We can see that Bub LOOKS DIFFERENT here on Earth. In place of the vicious hellhound, he is now rather adorable. He looks around, realizing where he is.
C: BUB
D: Please tell me I’m not on Earth. The only place worse than this is Heaven.
C: ENID
D: Look, Finn. It’s a dog!
C: FINN
D: Must be prehistoric. Probably got stuck in the tar millions of years ago.
C: BUB
D: That theory is about as dumb as your name, Finn.
N: His words come out as ADORABLE BARKS. He can no longer speak. **NOTE: We hear all ANIMAL DIALOGUE in V.O. as thoughts or as conversation between animals.**
C: BUB
D: What was that? Was that me? Wait, you can’t hear me?
E: CONT'D
C: FINN
D: This is awesome. We’ll be on the news and I can plug my bamboo clothes.
C: ENID
D: Come here, little guy. Don’t be scared. We’ll call you “T-Rex.” Because “Rex” is like a dog’s name.
E: reaching out
C: FINN
D: Good one, Enid.
C: BUB
D: Boy, you two idiots are perfect for each other.
E: MORE
C: BUB
D: Get off me.
E: CONT'D then
N: He SNAPS at her hand which she pulls away.
C: BUB
D: I gotta get back home. Out of my way, skinjobs!
E: CONT'D
N: Bub runs through Enid’s legs and bolts toward the tar pit. He leaps into the goo.
C: BUB
D: All right, Portal. Do your thing.
E: CONT'D
N: But instead of being transported back to Hell, he just starts to SLOWWWWWWLY SINK into the muck.
C: BUB
D: Okay... this is a bit slower than the last time... getting a little concerned...
E: CONT'D
N: The tar is now almost up to his nose.
C: BUB
D: This might have been a mistake... HELP! Skinjobs! Get me outta here!
E: CONT'D
N: Several well-meaning PEOPLE gather at the sight of this helpless, yipping pup stuck in the tar. Enid and Finn run over.
C: ENID
D: Dino-Dog! Grab my floppy hat!
N: She tosses one end of her big, stupid hat to Bub who grabs it in his mouth. Enid pulls him to safety. The moment he’s on solid ground, he BITES HER HAND.
C: ENID
D: OW!
E: CONT'D
C: BUB
D: That’s what you get.
N: He RUNS OFF, zig-zagging across the park, upsetting almost every movie-goers’ blanket and picnic, leaving a trail of tar in his wake. He looks back and notices one blanket he missed. For good measure, HE DOUBLES BACK AND TRASHES the last remaining picnicker.
S: EXT. HOPEWELL JUNCTION STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: The tar-covered dog barrels across the street.
C: BUB
D: What do I do?! The portal’s closed. I’m trapped here!
E: to himself
N: Confused and overwhelmed, Bub runs toward the first open door he sees.
S: INT. BEDDING SHOP - CONTINUOUS
N: A quaint shop filled with white linens and fluffy pillows. Suddenly, Bub bursts in, smearing the place with tar and racing straight through a display of DOWN PILLOWS. He emerges TARRED AND FEATHERED as he runs back outside.
S: INT. MINIVAN - SAME
N: Tomàs and the girls drive across town.
C: JENNI
D: Hey, Dad. Is that our new school?
C: TOMÀS
D: Sure is. You know the soccer field has an electronic scoreboard.
C: GRACE
D: Wow. That makes up for losing all my friends to come here.
E: sarcastic
C: JENNI
D: We’ve gotta be positive, Grace. You’ll never see the stars if you keep looking down.
C: GRACE
D: Oh, yeah? What if I’m walking on a mirror?
C: TOMÀS
D: C’mon, Grace. You’re not walking on a mirror.
N: Tomàs’s phone rings over the BLUETOOTH.
C: JENNI
D: Ooh, it’s Grandma.
C: TOMÀS
D: Why don’t we wait till we--
N: Too late. Jenni has picked up the call.
C: TOMÀS
D: Hey, Carmen!
E: CONT'D forced upbeat
C: CARMEN
D: Tomàs. We thought you’d call us when you got to the new house.
E: O.S.
C: TOMÀS
D: We’re not there yet. We stopped for some Burger King on the way.
C: CARMEN
D: Burger King. Hmm.
E: O.S. a bit judge-y
C: TOMÀS
D: Yup. Not a lot of options on the freeway.
C: JENNI
D: Dad got me an Oreo Cookie Cheesecake Shake!
E: excited
N: Tomàs wishes she hadn’t shared that.
C: CARMEN
D: Well, isn’t that something.
E: O.S.
N: Tomàs sighs.
S: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: Bub, still covered in tar and feathers, trots down the road.
C: BUB
D: This is disgusting. I’m all mortal up here. I can’t believe I let myself get duped by those dopes--
N: A passing car nearly HITS him.
C: BUB
D: Hey, watch it! Wait a minute. If I die, I’ll go right back to Hell!
E: realizing
N: He turns and steps directly into the path of an oncoming vehicle.
C: BUB
D: Satan, here I come!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS
C: CARMEN
D: You know, you could’ve flown out there and shipped your car.
E: O.S.
C: TOMÀS
D: Yeah, but as I said, I’m trying to save up some cash until I start getting my new paycheck.
C: CARMEN
D: Flying is safer.
E: O.S.
C: TOMÀS
D: Well, I’m a pretty safe driver--
C: JENNI
D: Look out!
N: Tomàs looks up. In the headlights he sees a strange feathered creature standing in the road. Tomàs SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.
S: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: As the van screeches up toward Bub, he suddenly remembers something.
C: BUB
D: Hang on. Didn’t Satan once say “all Earth dogs go to Heaven?” Oh no!
N: But before he can move out of the way, he’s knocked down by the van as it stops in front of him.
S: INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS
C: GRACE
D: Dad! You killed it!
C: CARMEN
D: Killed what?! What’s going on?!
E: O.S.
C: TOMÀS
D: Stay in the van, girls.
N: He unbuckles and gets out of the van.
C: JENNI
D: It looked like a giant chicken.
C: CARMEN
D: Your father killed a chicken?!
E: O.S.
C: JENNI
D: Wait, it’s not a chicken.
E: peering over the dash
C: CARMEN
D: Oh, thank goodness.
E: O.S.
C: JENNI
D: It’s a dog.
C: CARMEN
D: What?!
E: O.S.
C: JENNI
D: We’ll call you back, Grandma.
S: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: Grace and Jenni join Tomàs who is kneeling beside a stunned Bub.
C: TOMÀS
D: You okay, little guy?
C: BUB
D: Do I look, okay, you moron?! Just ‘cause I was standing in the road waiting to get hit, doesn’t give you the right to hit me!
N: Tomàs notices a 20-something, gum chewing dude who runs the newsstand has witnessed the incident.
C: TOMÀS
D: Nothing to see here!
E: to the dude, forced smile
C: JENNI
D: Is he gonna be okay, Dad?
C: TOMÀS
D: He seems okay, but we should probably have a vet check him out.
N: Tomàs scoops up Bub in his arms. Bub growls.
C: BUB
D: Put me down, you weirdo!
N: Grace plucks a feather off Bub’s fur.
C: GRACE
D: What’s with all the feathers?
C: BUB
D: What’s with all the eye-liner?
S: INT. VET’S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - LATER
N: Tomàs and the girls are joined by the VERY OLD VET, DR. CASEY.
C: DR. CASEY
D: Well, I’ve got some sad news.
C: TOMÀS
D: Oh no.
C: DR. CASEY
D: You’ve got a very sick cat there.
C: TOMÀS
D: We... we brought in a dog.
C: DR. CASEY
D: Ohh. The dog’s fine.
C: TOMÀS
D: What a relief.
C: DR. CASEY
D: We cleaned off the tar and the feathers. He’s a perfectly healthy pooch. Little bitey.
C: TOMÀS
D: That’s great. I was afraid my first official act in town was gonna be murdering a dog.
C: DR. CASEY
D: You folks are new?
C: JENNI
D: My dad is the new soccer coach at St. Timothy’s.
C: DR. CASEY
D: Wonderful. You girls will love it here. Y’know we’ve got a tar pit and movies in the park.
C: GRACE
D: Yup. We saw that.
C: DR. CASEY
D: Well, that’s about the extent of it.
C: TOMÀS
D: So, Doc, what’s gonna happen to the dog?
C: DR. CASEY
D: He doesn’t have a microchip so he has to go to the shelter.
C: JENNI
D: What if no one claims him?
C: DR. CASEY
D: Well, they don’t have room for every dog...
C: JENNI
D: Can we keep him, Dad?
C: TOMÀS
D: Honey, we haven’t even unpacked. He’ll be okay at the shelter. I bet it’s really nice there.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: INT. ANIMAL SHELTER CORRIDOR - NIGHT
N: BANG! A steel door is slammed shut and a shelter worker, STEVE, leads a leashed Bub down a cold, dark hallway lined with cages. Dogs of all shapes and sizes peer out at the new “inmate.” A Doberman with one eye, SNUGGLES, glares at Bub.
C: SNUGGLES
D: Well, well. Looks like we got us some fresh meat.
N: A mangy German Shepherd, HEIDI, joins in the heckling.
C: HEIDI
D: Hope you like being hungry. ‘Cause I’m gonna eat your food.
N: A massive Pitbull, APRICOT, growls.
C: APRICOT
D: You got a real pretty mouth on you.
C: BUB
D: Uh... thanks?
N: Steve places Bub in a cage with another dog, a shivering little Pekingese named WILLY. The door slams shut behind him.
C: WILLY
D: Hey, how ya doing? I’m Willy.
E: think Joe Pantoliano
C: BUB
D: Bub. What is this place?
C: WILLY
D: This? This is hell.
C: BUB
D: Trust me. This isn’t Hell. Smells like it though.
C: WILLY
D: Look, tell me if I’m outta line here, but can I give you some advice? Lay of the land, so you don’t step on the wrong paws?
N: Bub shrugs.
C: WILLY
D: Those guys you passed? That’s Snuggles, Heidi and Apricot. They’s kinda the alphas around here. The top dogs. If I was you? I’d steer clear of them.
E: CONT'D
C: BUB
D: Is that right?
C: WILLY
D: Apricot did this to me just for lookin’ him in the eye.
N: Willy shows him a tear in his ear.
C: WILLY
D: Now I’ll never get adopted. No one wants a pooch with a wonky ear.
E: CONT'D
C: BUB
D: Adopted?
C: WILLY
D: Yeah. That’s the only way out of here. Well, except for The Room.
N: He nods toward the end of the hall at an ominous steel door with a soundproof window.
C: BUB
D: What happens in there?
C: WILLY
D: We don’t like to talk about it. I’ll just put it this way: that’s where they kill you. In that room. With poison. They kill you with poison in that room.
C: BUB
D: I can’t die here. If I die I won’t go to Hell.
E: to himself
C: WILLY
D: Huh?
E: leaning in
C: BUB
D: Can you just give me some space? I’m trying to think.
C: WILLY
D: Yeah, you bet.
N: Bub curls up on a ratty towel.
C: WILLY
D: Technically, that was my sleeping towel, but you’re welcome to it. Enjoy. I’ll just lie down here on these, uh, cold metal bars.
E: CONT'D quietly
S: EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Tomàs’s minivan parks in the driveway of the quaint home. Tomàs, Grace and Jenni get out.
C: TOMÀS
D: Girls, the dog will be fine. I’m sure someone will adopt him.
C: GRACE
D: I looked it up. The ASPCA gives the Hopewell Junction dog shelter an “F” rating. Very high kill rates.
C: TOMÀS
D: Boy, you like to look up sad stuff. Tell you what. We’ll check in tomorrow and see if anyone’s taken him home.
E: then
C: GRACE
D: If there is a tomorrow.
C: TOMÀS
D: All right-- AHH!
N: He reacts as he finds a woman, KAREN, 30’s, standing inches away from him.
C: KAREN
D: Hi.
C: TOMÀS
D: Wow. Hi. You just kind of appeared, huh?
C: KAREN
D: I tend to do that. As head of the Neighborhood Watch I’ve worked to hone my stealthiness.
E: MORE
C: KAREN
D: The key is walking on the balls of your feet rather than the soles.
E: CONT'D
C: TOMÀS
D: Hmm. Pro tip.
C: KAREN
D: I’m Karen Van Buren. That’s my house.
N: She points across the street to an immaculately maintained home. On the porch, a VERY OLD, ANGRY LOOKING WOMAN sits motionless in a rocking chair.
C: KAREN
D: That’s my mother. Also Karen.
E: CONT'D
C: TOMÀS
D: Nice to meet you.
C: JENNI
D: Hello!
E: calling to older Karen
C: KAREN
D: She can’t hear you. Her high frequency hearing is shot. If you want her to hear you, you have to speak much lower.
C: JENNI
D: Hello!
E: deeper voice
N: The old lady just stares.
C: JENNI
D: She still didn’t hear me.
E: CONT'D
C: KAREN
D: No, she did.
C: TOMÀS
D: Well, I’m Tomàs. This is--
C: KAREN
D: Grace and Jenni. I know. I did a bit of Googling after your escrow closed. I’m sorry about your wife.
C: TOMÀS
D: Thank you.
E: a little freaked out
C: KAREN
D: Anyway, I’ll get out of your hair. Here’s everything you need to know.
E: handing him a thick binder
C: TOMÀS
D: About?
C: KAREN
D: Oh, basic compliance items. Lawn height, porch light intensity, sprinkler overspray. Sidewalk chalk.
E: grim
C: GRACE
D: You enforce all these things?
C: KAREN
D: “Enforce” is a strong word... which the sheriff has asked me not to use. Think of them as required suggestions. If you need anything, mother and I are always home. Always watching.
E: heading off
N: She pads off silently on the balls of her feet.
C: TOMÀS
D: Ten bucks says “mother” is a skeleton in a wig.
N: Grace chuckles.
S: EXT. ANIMAL SHELTER, “THE YARD” - NEXT DAY
N: We PAN across the prison-like exercise yard where various dog “prisoners” play with a tennis ball, sniff butts, etc. The three toughs, Heidi, Apricot and Snuggles, stand together glaring at the others. As we PUSH IN to Bub who sits by Willy, we hear:
C: MORGAN FREEMAN
D: Some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him... like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place...
E: V.O.
C: SHELTER WORKER
D: Yo, Steve. Can you help me refill the water bowls?
E: O.S.
N: REVEAL Steve the guard is watching “The Shawshank Redemption” on his phone. He turns it off and heads inside.
C: BUB
D: I can’t just sit here like this. I’m running out of time.
E: to Willy
C: WILLY
D: I know. We all are.
C: BUB
D: No. If I stay on Earth for more than four days, I can never go back to Hell. I’ll become a mortal dog. Like you useless losers.
C: WILLY
D: Ouch. What are you gonna do? Break outta here? No one’s ever done that before. I mean, you got Steve. You got the fence. That’s about it.
N: Ignoring him, Bub studies the air conditioning system, following the ducts where they lead. Willy trots after him.
C: WILLY
D: Whoa, whoa. You’re getting into Alpha territory there!
E: CONT'D
N: Sure enough, Heidi, Apricot and Snuggles notice Bub encroaching into their area.
C: APRICOT
D: Hey. Where do you think you’re going?
C: BUB
D: I’ve got no time for you, Apricot.
C: SNUGGLES
D: Oh. Looks like we got a tough guy here.
C: HEIDI
D: Maybe we gotta teach tough guy a lesson, eh Snuggles?
N: The three larger dogs surround Bub.
C: BUB
D: “A lesson”? From you three? I’ve been alive for five thousand years. What are you’re gonna teach me? How to eat my own poop?
N: ANGLE ON Apricot who looks up, caught, having eaten something off the ground.
C: APRICOT
D: That wasn’t mine.
N: The alpha dogs start growling at Bub.
C: BUB
D: Hey, look at that. You were right about Heidi’s growl, Snuggles. It does sound like a kitten purring.
C: HEIDI
D: Hold up. You said that about me?
E: to Snuggles
C: SNUGGLES
D: What? No.
C: BUB
D: Of course, it’s not as bad as when Heidi said that Apricot smells like wet dog even when he’s dry.
C: APRICOT
D: I have a condition!
E: hurt, to Heidi
C: BUB
D: Probably the worst, though, was when Apricot said you had the shortest tail she’s ever seen.
E: to Snuggles
C: SNUGGLES
D: Hey! No one’s ever complained about my tail.
C: BUB
D: Heidi said it’s skinny and short.
C: SNUGGLES
D: That’s it!
N: All at once, the three big dogs square off, bickering and then attacking one another. Bub steps back, enjoying the chaos he’s wrought.
C: WILLY
D: I can’t believe they said all those things to you.
C: BUB
D: They didn’t. I was lying.
C: WILLY
D: What’s “lying”?
C: BUB
D: Man, you Earth dogs are stupid. THAT’S ENOUGH!
E: yelling
N: All the dogs on the yard, including the three who were fighting, stop and turn to Bub.
C: BUB
D: Listen up. I’m the alpha now! You’re gonna help me get outta here or else. ‘Cause it’s time you realized, I’m not locked in here with you. YOU’RE LOCKED IN HERE WITH ME!
E: CONT'D a la Rorschach in “Watchmen”
N: Simultaneously, every dog ear lays down flat, submissive.
S: INT. PEÑA HOUSE, GRACE’S ROOM - DAY
N: Grace unpacks boxes as TOMÀS enters.
C: TOMÀS
D: Hey. Y’know there’s an excellent music program at this school. I was thinking you could pick up the guitar again.
C: GRACE
D: We’ll see.
N: There’s an awkward silence. TOMÀS is desperate to break Grace out of her despondency.
C: TOMÀS
D: You know, honey, if you ever want to talk... about anything, I’m right here.
C: GRACE
D: Thanks, but I’m good.
N: TOMÀS sighs and exits. After a beat, Grace takes out a jewelry box. Inside is a PENDANT encrusted with a striking PURPLE GEM. She opens the pendant to reveal a PHOTO of herself with her mom, ISABEL. Both are jamming on guitars and laughing.
C: GRACE
D: This would suck a whole lot less if you were here.
E: CONT'D
N: She sadly closes the pendant and puts the chain around her neck.
S: INT. PEÑA HOUSE, KITCHEN - LATER
N: Tomàs is on a ladder painting the room when Jenni enters with an open laptop.
C: JENNI
D: Dad, I’ve been thinking about that dog we hit.
C: TOMÀS
D: Okay...
C: JENNI
D: I’ve decided we really do need to adopt him and here’s why: number one, dogs are super-cute.
C: TOMÀS
D: I’m gonna need more than that.
C: JENNI
D: Number two. It’s a new town. I’m gonna need new friends. Dogs are a magnet for meeting people.
C: TOMÀS
D: I’m not worried about you making friends.
C: JENNI
D: Number three, mental health experts agree that pets are a wonderful way to help children overcome loss and emotional tribu-- tribul-- --tribulation.
E: consults laptop
C: TOMÀS
D: Sweetie, that’s exactly why I got you your hamster.
C: JENNI
D: Yeah, but Sebastian’s kind of... ...dumb. All he does is run on that wheel and move his wood shavings into piles. It’s just not what my heart needs.
E: whispers normal volume
C: TOMÀS
D: Are you finished?
C: JENNI
D: Yes. And so is this little guy if we don’t act.
N: She turns the computer around to show him the website of the Hopewell Junction Animal Shelter. It’s a photo of Bub beneath the heading: “SOON TO BE EUTHANIZED”
C: JENNI
D: Grace wasn’t kidding about that place.
E: CONT'D
N: Tomàs sighs.
S: INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - DAY
N: Bub and Willy are in their cage as are the other dogs. A Cockapoo, BIJOU, across the room glances at Bub and the hellhound nods. Bijou begins HOWLING at the top of her lungs. We hear a BUZZER as the door opens and Steve enters.
C: STEVE
D: What’s going on, Bijou?
C: BIJOU
D: I’M DISTRACTING YOU! BUB TOLD ME TO GO CRAZY TO DISTRACT YOU!
N: But of course all Steve hears are the yips and wails coming from the pooch. He hits ONE OF SEVERAL BUTTONS HIGH ON THE WALL and Bijou’s cage springs open. Steve removes Bijou from the cage and closes the cage door, failing to notice that Bijou’s cellmate, a Dachshund named BARRY, has stuck his little paw in the door, preventing it from locking. As Steve examines Bijou on an exam table, Barry slips out of his cage and crosses to an open toolchest on the floor.
C: BUB
D: Good, good...
N: Barry picks up a HAMMER and shows it to Bub.
C: BUB
D: No. Screwdriver. We need the screwdriver.
E: CONT'D
N: Barry puts down the hammer and picks up a pliers.
C: BUB
D: That’s a pliers.
E: CONT'D
N: Barry puts it back. Picks up the hammer again.
C: BUB
D: Ugh. The littler they are, the dumber they are.
E: CONT'D
N: Finally, Barry picks up a screwdriver. But Steve is almost turning back around.
C: BUB
D: Good! Yes! Bring it back to your cage! Go!
E: CONT'D
N: Barry trots back into his cage just as Steve returns with Bijou. He notices the open cage but fails to notice the screwdriver in Barry’s mouth.
C: STEVE
D: Oops. There ya go. No more howling now.
E: locking the cage
C: BIJOU
D: I distracted you. That was my job.
C: BARRY
D: And I got a screwdriver, whatever that is!
N: Steve exits the room, the door locking behind him.
C: BUB
D: Now pass it down to me!
N: With his mouth, Barry passes the screwdriver through the bars to his neighbor. That dog passes it to the next cage and so on. It makes its way to a beagle who holds it in his mouth, confused. Then he passes it back in the wrong direction.
C: BUB
D: No, no! That’s the wrong way.
E: CONT'D
N: The beagle turns around and gives it to the other neighbor. Finally, the tool reaches Heidi, the German Shepherd, who holds the handle out to Bub. Bub grabs it with his mouth but Heidi refuses to let go.
C: BUB
D: Let go!
E: CONT'D
C: HEIDI
D: I can’t! You’re pulling on it.
C: BUB
D: So what? Just let go!
C: HEIDI
D: My mouth won’t let me! This feels like a game.
C: BUB
D: It’s not a game! Drop it!
C: HEIDI
D: TAKE IT! GIVE IT TO ME! TAKE IT!
E: not letting go
N: Bub finally stops trying. Instantly, Heidi drops it in his cage.
C: HEIDI
D: There you go.
E: CONT'D like nothing happened
N: Bub sighs and is about to start unscrewing the screws in a WALL VENT, when he hears,
C: BOY
D: What about that one, Mommy?
E: O.S.
N: Bub quickly sits on the screwdriver as Steve escorts in a young BOY and his MOM. The pair look in at the beagle.
C: MOM
D: I’ve heard beagles aren’t very smart.
C: BUB
D: Oh, I can confirm that.
N: Bub’s yip brings the kid to his and Willy’s cage.
C: BOY
D: This one’s cute.
E: re: Willy
C: WILLY
D: Thanks. You’re not so bad yourself.
C: MOM
D: There’s something wrong with his ear.
C: WILLY
D: You can cover that or put a hat on me... Or I can stand the other way so you never see it.
E: desperate
C: BOY
D: I don’t mind his ear. I like him.
N: Steve presses the button, opening their cage. He hands Willy to the boy. Willy licks his face.
C: BUB
D: Oh, disgusting. You’re getting kid face on your tongue.
N: The kid hugs Willy. Willy is in heaven. Despite his disdain, we get an inkling that Bub is a little jealous of the affection he’s witnessing.
C: MOM
D: All right, we’ll take this one.
C: WILLY
D: Looks like Willy’s found himself a home. I’ll see you around, guys. Hope you get back to Hell, Bub.
C: BUB
D: Yeah. Thanks.
N: The humans exit with Willy. Bub goes back to unscrewing the vent, which he accomplishes by holding the screwdriver in his mouth and repeatedly ROLLING OVER.
C: BUB
D: Oh boy, I’m getting dizzy.
E: CONT'D
N: At last, the vent cover falls away and Bub climbs into the vent.
S: INT. VENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Bub squeezes his way through the ducts, climbing up a slope until he finds himself at another vent. Using his feet, he kicks loose the vent and peers out.
S: INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - CONTINUOUS
N: Bub is now looking down on the room of cages where he began. On the wall directly below him are the SWITCHES that open the dog cages.
C: BUB
D: Everybody ready?!
N: The dogs answer in a cacophony of nonsense:
C: DOGS
D: I’m hungry!/My name is Mike!/What’s a screwdriver?!
C: BUB
D: Good enough.
N: He steels himself, then leaves the vent, SLIDING DOWN THE WALL, hitting as many of the buttons as he can. By the time he lands on the floor, most of the cages have sprung open.
S: INT. ANIMAL SHELTER, FRONT OFFICE - SAME
N: Steve reacts as he hears a chorus of barks echoing from the cage room. He buzzes open the door and his eyes go wide as he sees: FIFTY DOGS CHARGING AT HIM IN SLOW-MOTION. They barrel over him, knocking him to the floor as they run to the exit, Bub among them.
S: EXT. ANIMAL SHELTER - CONTINUOUS
N: The dogs burst out of the shelter and head in all directions. Bub finds himself running alongside his three erstwhile foes: Heidi, Snuggles and Apricot.
C: HEIDI
D: That was amazing! Thanks, Bub!
C: APRICOT
D: Yeah, I thought we were all headed to The Room for sure.
C: SNUGGLES
D: You ever need anything, Bub, we’re just a howl away.
C: BUB
D: I don’t need anyone or anything so get lost.
C: HEIDI
D: Y’know, there’s a heart of gold in there somewhere. I can smell it.
E: teasing
C: BUB
D: No way you can smell anything over your own disgusting funk.
N: Heidi and the other two laugh as they veer off into the woods while Bub continues toward the nearest road.
S: INT. MINIVAN - SAME
N: Tomàs drives with Jenni.
C: TOMÀS
D: A hamster is one thing but having a dog is a big responsibility. You need to promise you’re gonna take care of him.
C: JENNI
D: I’ll do everything. Don’t worry.
C: TOMÀS
D: That’s easy to say. You have to feed him, walk him, make sure he doesn’t get off the leash. Because he could run right in front of a--
N: Tomàs suddenly notices Bub running across the road, directly in the path of the van. He SLAMS ON THE BRAKES once again.
C: TOMÀS/JENNI
D: AHHHHH!
N: The van stops inches from Bub.
S: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: The Peña’s hurry out of the van and find Bub unharmed but pissed off.
C: BUB
D: You again?! What are you? A dog hunter?
C: TOMÀS
D: Oh my gosh, it’s him!
N: Before Bub can run off, Jenni scoops him up.
C: JENNI
D: This is a sign from above that we were meant to adopt him!
C: BUB
D: The fact that you almost killed me twice? Seems more like a sign from below.
C: JENNI
D: I’m gonna call you Lucky. ‘Cause we were so lucky to find you.
N: Tomàs is charmed in spite of his misgivings.
C: TOMÀS
D: If I didn’t know better, I’d say Lucky was smiling.
C: BUB
D: This ain’t a smile, jackass. This is just the way my lips are shaped.
C: JENNI
D: Come on. Let’s get you home.
C: BUB
D: I don’t wanna get to your home. I wanna get to my home!
N: Jenni carries him to the van.
C: BUB
D: ...and she’s putting me in the van. Great.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. AIRPLANE - DAY
N: A passenger, REGINA, 50’s, wakes up in a airplane seat, jostled violently by BAD TURBULENCE. Looking around, she sees she’s the only passenger.
C: REGINA
D: What’s happening?! How did I get here? I hate flying!
E: freaked out
N: A flight attendant wheels up a drinks cart.
C: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
D: Hello. Thanks again for choosing Hell-ta Airlines.
N: REVEAL it’s SATAN in a airline uniform.
C: SATAN
D: And I know you hate flying. That’s why we cooked this up for you. But don’t worry about the rough air. The captain tells me it should only last... forever.
N: The terrified woman runs out of her row and stumbles down the aisle.
C: SATAN
D: Hellhounds! Sic her!
E: CONT'D calling off
N: She turns and sees Phobos and Morphos barking and running behind her. She reaches the lavatory at the rear of the plane and frantically tries to open it but the door is locked.
C: REGINA
D: Please! Please! Help me!
E: losing her shit
N: But before the two dogs reach her, they slow to a stop.
C: PHOBOS
D: I don’t feel so good...
C: MORPHOS
D: Neither do I.
N: They both begin to dry heave from air sickness.
C: PHOBOS
D: This turbulence is really hitting me.
N: As the damned woman watches the dogs heave and stumble around in the aisle, her fear gives way to confusion. Satan fumes.
C: SATAN
D: You two are useless!
C: MORPHOS
D: Sorry, boss. I’ve never been great with the Hell-ta Airlines bit.
E: gagging
C: SATAN
D: I need a real hellhound. Where in Hell is Bub?!
N: Phobos and Morphos exchange a nervous, nauseous look.
S: EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - LATER
N: The minivan pulls into the driveway. Tomàs, Jenni and Bub head inside. REVERSE to find Karen peering out of her window across the street. Her eyes narrow at the sight of a dog. After a moment, her ancient mother, also Karen, leans in behind her. Her eyes narrow as well.
S: INT. PEÑA HOME, LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Tomàs and Jenni bring Bub inside. Bub takes in the cozy decor.
C: BUB
D: This is where you live? What a heaven-hole.
E: sneering
N: Grace enters.
C: GRACE
D: Seriously? You brought that thing home?
C: JENNI
D: We almost ran into him again. So I named him Lucky.
C: GRACE
D: He looks more like an Unlucky.
C: BUB
D: Good one, kid. I like that you think you’re the clever one.
C: JENNI
D: Come on, pup. I’ll show you my room.
N: She exits with Bub.
C: TOMÀS
D: Honey, we don’t even know if he’s housebroken.
E: calling after
C: GRACE
D: Guess we’ll find out.
N: Tomàs’s cell phone rings. He looks at it and steels himself.
C: TOMÀS
D: Hello?
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT. CARMEN AND FRANCISCO’S APARTMENT - SAME
N: Tomàs’s in-laws, CARMEN AND FRANCISCO, a well-off, 70- something couple in a stylish apartment share the speaker phone.
C: FRANCISCO
D: Hi. We thought we’d hear from you by now.
C: TOMÀS
D: Sorry. It’s been a little crazy.
C: GRACE
D: Dad hit that dog with the car again.
C: FRANCISCO
D: What?!
C: CARMEN
D: The same dog?!
C: TOMÀS
D: He’s fine.
C: GRACE
D: Now it lives with us.
C: FRANCISCO
D: You’ve barely moved in and you got a dog?
C: TOMÀS
D: I think he’ll be good for the girls. Someone close by who can give them unconditional love.
C: CARMEN
D: That used to be us.
E: pointedly
C: TOMÀS
D: Look, guys, you know I couldn’t pass up this job opportunity. And a small town might be a welcome change for all of us.
C: FRANCISCO
D: How’s the house?
E: changing the subject
C: TOMÀS
D: Good. Giving it a little paint job. The hot water heater is on its last legs, so I’ll need to replace that at some point.
C: FRANCISCO
D: Do you need more money?
C: TOMÀS
D: No. We’re fine. And I’m going to pay you guys back every dime you loaned me. That’s a promise.
E: quickly
C: CARMEN
D: Hopefully you won’t be paying us in dimes?
N: Tomàs forces a laugh. Grace rolls her eyes. She doesn’t like to see her dad emasculated. She goes.
C: FRANCISCO
D: We’ve decided we’re going to fly out this weekend.
C: TOMÀS
D: You are?
C: CARMEN
D: We want to make sure the girls are okay there.
C: TOMÀS
D: Kinda feels like you’re checking up on me.
C: FRANCISCO
D: Don’t be silly. We just miss our granddaughters. Now that you’ve taken them 400 miles away.
N: Off Tomàs’s frustration,
S: INT. JENNI’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Jenni is enthusiastically showing an indifferent Bub around her room.
C: JENNI
D: This is my homework station. I’ve never fallen below an A minus. These are my stuffed animals. Promise you won’t chew them up...
C: BUB
D: I ain’t promising anything.
N: She holds up an adorable female ventriloquist dummy.
C: JENNI
D: This is Lulu. I’m going to do ventriloquism for the back-to- school talent show.
C: BUB
D: That’ll make you popular. Stop staring at me.
E: off Lulu’s dead eyes
C: JENNI
D: I’m hoping if I do a really funny show, it’ll cheer up my dad and get him out of the funk he’s been in. He’s been through a lot. We all have.
C: BUB
D: Wow. You are one compassionate, boring kid.
C: JENNI
D: And this is Sebastian, your new roommate.
N: She nods to the hamster cage where Sebastian is running on his wheel. He’s a twitchy, hyperactive spaz. Think the voice of Charlie Day.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Hey, there. You must be Lucky.
C: BUB
D: My name’s Bub. As in Beelzebub.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’ll call you Lucky, ‘cause I didn’t follow that.
C: JENNI
D: I’m gonna hang a green curtain here so I can have virtual backgrounds on my Tik Toks...
N: As she continues to prattle on, Bub ignores her and speaks with Sebastian.
C: BUB
D: Hey, rat? You wouldn’t happen to know how to re-open the portal to Hell in those tar pits, would you?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Nope. I think she’s still talking to you, by the way.
E: re: Jenni
C: BUB
D: Yeah, I don’t care about her.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You should. She’s a really sweet kid.
E: MORE
C: SEBASTIAN
D: She gives me seeds when I’m good. I’m not sure what the difference is when I’m good or bad, but I love the seeds. All kinds of seeds. You got any seeds, man?
E: CONT'D
C: BUB
D: No. Calm down.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You know what calms me down? Seeds. Sunflower, sesame, poppy. I don’t care. I’ll eat any kinda seed. And I’ll do anything for ‘em. Anything.
C: BUB
D: You’re a mess. Why would these people want you for a pet?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: They got me after Jenni lost her mom--
C: BUB
D: Who’s Jenni?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You’re in her room! She’s right there!
C: BUB
D: Oh, right.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: After she died, they got me to make Jenni feel better. But now they got you. Which tells me I wasn’t making her feel better enough. Which makes me think I’m not gonna get anymore seeds. Which makes me very nervous. You got any seeds?
C: BUB
D: No!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Maybe there’s one around here. Excuse me for a second.
N: The hamster frantically pushes his wood chips from one corner of the cage to the other. He finds a single sunflower seed.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yes! It’s cut with a little sawdust but beggars can’t be choosers.
E: CONT'D examines it
N: He pops it in his mouth and shudders with ecstasy.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Ohhhh, there’s papa’s medicine. What were we talking about? Oh, yeah. You replacing me. I’m not jealous or anything. Okay, I’m a little jealous. But nothing a run in the country can’t fix.
E: CONT'D then
N: He leaps into his hamster wheel and runs like a lunatic. Bub glances from the frenzied hamster to Jenni who continues to enthusiastically describe her room.
C: BUB
D: I’m in a nut house. So you don’t know anything about the portal in the middle of your town?
E: to Sebastian
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I can’t hear you! Hang on. Let me come back to you.
N: Sebastian switches directions in his wheel and runs again. Finally, he hops off.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: All I can tell you is when these people need to know something, they go to the glow-square.
E: CONT'D
C: BUB
D: What’s a glow-square?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It’s got buttons. It glows. They sit in front of that thing for hours.
C: BUB
D: Oh, a computer. Satan’s got those. He’s got a whole troll farm down there. Where can I find one?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Grace has one.
C: BUB
D: Who’s Grace?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: The other girl! Boy, you really don’t know your family, do you?
C: BUB
D: They’re not my family.
N: He goes. Both Bub and Jenni call after.
C: JENNI SEBASTIAN
D: Where are you going? Bring back some seeds!
S: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Bub walks down the hall to Grace’s door which has a SIGIL OF BAPHOMET (a Satanic star) taped to it.
C: BUB
D: That’s more like it.
N: He nudges open the door and enters.
S: INT. GRACE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Bub pokes his head in. The room has a goth theme: black curtains, posters for punk bands.
C: BUB
D: Girl’s got style.
N: Grace is on her bed, ear buds in, fiddling with the pendant of her mom.
C: BUB
D: Hey, poser, where’s your computer?
E: CONT'D
N: She doesn’t hear him so Bub JUMPS up onto her bed, startling her.
C: GRACE
D: What the--!
N: Bub’s eye is caught by the UNIQUE DARK PURPLE STONE inset in the pendant.
C: BUB
D: What’ve you got there?
N: He sniffs it.
C: GRACE
D: Don’t slobber on that. It’s black amethyst. My mom gave it to me.
E: pulling it away
N: She takes the pendant and places it carefully in a jewelry box on a high shelf in her closet.
C: BUB
D: I didn’t ask for your life story. Now where’s your--
N: He spots her laptop on the desk.
C: BUB
D: Bingo.
E: CONT'D
N: He trots to her desk, jumps onto her office chair and begins pawing at the computer.
C: BUB
D: Dumb little buttons.
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE
D: Hey, hey. Get away from that.
N: She closes the laptop and shoos him away.
C: BUB
D: I’m just trying to get some information here. The sooner I get it, the sooner I’ll be out of your freaky blue hair.
C: GRACE
D: You’re my sister’s pet, not mine. Just get outta my room.
C: BUB
D: I’m nobody’s pet. And I’m not leaving till I get what I want.
N: They have a brief stare-down. Neither flinches. She sticks her tongue out at Bub. He sticks his out at her. Curious, Grace suddenly jumps at him with her hands out...
C: GRACE
D: BOO!
N: Bub gets up on his hind-legs and barks back at her.
C: BUB
D: BOO!
C: GRACE
D: You’re a weird dog, you know that?
C: BUB
D: You’re a weird kid.
C: GRACE
D: Whatever. I’m going to bed.
C: BUB
D: Good. And I’m gonna use your computer as soon as you fall asleep. Because hellhounds never rest.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. GRACE'S ROOM - LATER
N: Grace is fast asleep in bed. TILT DOWN to find Bub fast asleep on the floor. After a beat, he SNORTS and wakes up.
C: BUB
D: Oh, right.
N: He moves quietly to the desk and the laptop. Using a pencil in his mouth, he begins to type a search: “PORTAL HELL TAR PIT” The results pop up. He clicks on one and reads the page.
C: BUB
D: “Many believe the tar pits of Hopewell Junction offer a direct connection to the Underworld... blah, blah, blah... legend tells us that the portal between worlds can only be opened by an offering of a crown chakra crystal, also known as black amethyst.” Black amethyst!
E: CONT'D realizes
N: He scrolls down to a PHOTO that shows the distinctive purple stone. It’s the same kind as the one on Grace’s pendant. He turns to the closet where she placed the piece.
C: BUB
D: Thank you, Satan! That ventriloquist girl was right: this was a sign!
E: CONT'D
N: He shuts the laptop and quietly slinks over to the closet. He tries to jump up, but the shelf is way too high. He tries climbing up her hanging clothes but THE ROD BREAKS and he tumbles back down. Grace stirs but doesn’t wake up.
C: BUB
D: I need something tall.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Bub spots a small side table beneath the open second-story window at the end of the hall. He puts his paws on the top of the table and tries to pull it toward him. The table tips in his direction, then tips back, caught by a childproofing strap. Framed photos and a couple vases fall out the window, crashing to the ground. Across the street, a LIGHT immediately goes on in Karen’s house. She appears at the window with binoculars.
C: BUB
D: You childproof the table but leave the window open. Genius.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Bub looks around for something to help him. He notices Tomàs’s ladder, which is covered in a number of paint cans. A large box fan sits nearby.
C: BUB
D: There’s no way this can go wrong.
N: Using his teeth, he starts to drag the ladder across the room. As he passes the cord of the box fan, he accidentally steps on the switch, turning the fan on “high.” At the same time, the ladder’s leg hits the edge of the carpet. THE LADDER TEETERS ALONG WITH THE PAINT CANS.
C: BUB
D: Whoa, whoa...
E: CONT'D
N: The ladder falls and the paint cans with it. The cans pop open as they hit the floor and the whirring fan sends RED
S: PAINT SPLATTERING ACROSS THE ROOM. INT. KAREN’S HOUSE - SAME
N: Karen peers out her window and reacts with horror as she hears a bang and sees what appears to be BLOOD spatter the inside of Tomàs’s living room window. It looks like someone was just shot.
C: KAREN
D: Oh my! All right, Karen. This is what you trained for!
E: then
N: She holsters some pepper spray, grabs a Mag Lite and yanks on combat boots as she dials her cell.
C: KAREN
D: Sheriff Rogers? It’s Karen Van Buren!
E: CONT'D beat
C: I know it’s late.
D: No, this isn’t about sidewalk chalk. There’s been a murder!
E: beat
N: BACK TO:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Paint sprays all over everything, including Tomàs’s soccer equipment. Bub looks at the mess he’s made.
C: BUB
D: Maybe they won’t notice.
N: He grips the ladder in his mouth and begins dragging it toward the stairs backwards. The metal hinge grinds a divot across the hardwood floor, then tears through more of Tomàs’s equipment.
S: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: Karen marches across the street toward the Peña’s house like she’s storming the beach at Normandy. Her mother, Karen Sr., Peers out from the from door.
C: KAREN
D: STAY INSIDE, MOTHER!
E: deep voice so her mom can hear
S: INT. STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
N: Bub struggles as he hauls the ladder up the stairs with his teeth. He’s nearly at the top when he loses his grip. The ladder SLIDES DOWN THE STAIRS like a toboggan.
S: EXT. PEÑA HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS
N: Karen reaches up to knock on the door, but before she does, it is SMASHED OPEN by the ladder. Karen goes flying back off the porch.
C: KAREN
D: My coccyx.
E: small
S: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Tomàs, Grace and Jenni all open their bedroom doors, woken by the noise. They find Bub standing at the top of the stairs.
C: BUB
D: The hamster did it.
E: caught
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER
N: The sun is coming up. Tomàs waves to a police car as it drives off.
C: TOMÀS
D: Sorry about the mix-up!
N: He joins an angry but uninjured Karen who stands at the door with Grace, Jenni and Bub.
C: JENNI
D: He was just following his instincts.
C: KAREN
D: His “instinct” to carry a ladder upstairs? What is he, a fire dog?!
C: BUB
D: In a way.
C: TOMÀS
D: We’re really sorry about this. We’ll get a crate.
C: KAREN
D: Sorry doesn’t cut it. What if it had been my mother on the other side of that door? I’m quite sure her coccyx is not as resilient as my coccyx.
C: TOMÀS
D: Could you please stop saying “coccyx” in front of the girls?
C: KAREN
D: Look, our neighborhood regulations clearly state that no animal considered a nuisance may be kept as a pet.
C: JENNI
D: Lucky is not a nuisance!
N: Grace regards the broken door and the trashed living room.
C: GRACE
D: He kinda is.
C: KAREN
D: I’m contacting Animal Control and he will more than likely be taken to a shelter.
C: BUB
D: That place again?
C: JENNI
D: You can’t do this.
C: KAREN
D: Missy, unless he is a certified emotional support animal, I most certainly can.
N: Seeing how forlorn Jenni looks at the prospect of losing Bub, Tomàs makes a decision.
C: TOMÀS
D: That’s fine. Because he is an emotional support animal.
E: thinking fast
C: KAREN
D: Really. Where’s his little vest and paperwork?
C: TOMÀS
D: In the moving boxes. I’ll have to find them.
C: KAREN
D: I look forward to seeing that as soon as you do. Because if you don’t, that... creature is history. And I hope we get to see you at our annual pumpkin carve next week. B.Y.O.P.
E: beat, suddenly cheerful
N: Karen pads away on the balls of her feet.
C: BUB
D: I’ll definitely be seeing this broad after she dies.
S: INT. PEÑA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: The family enters. Tomàs does his best to shut the broken door.
C: JENNI
D: Dad, Lucky isn’t an emotional support dog.
C: TOMÀS
D: I know that, honey. He’s more the opposite.
C: JENNI
D: But I don’t want to lose him.
E: hugging Bub tightly
C: BUB
D: You’re gonna lose me if you keep squeezing me like that, Lenny.
C: TOMÀS
D: Fine. We’ll see if we can get him certified... But I’m really starting to regret hitting him with the van. Oh, no. I’m gonna be late for my first day. All of our first days. Everyone get dressed!
E: sighs looks at his watch
N: As he throws his soccer supplies into a gear bag, we
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY
N: Satan walks along a perilously high ledge with Phobos and Morphos at his heels. Hundreds of feet below we see a city street.
C: SATAN
D: Bub! You here, boy?
E: calling out
N: They pass a middle-aged man, HANK, who clings terrified to the side of the building.
C: HANK
D: Help me, please! I can’t take anymore!
C: SATAN
D: I thought you said you last saw him in Heights Hell.
E: ignoring him, to the dogs
C: MORPHOS
D: I did! Unless it was in Wool Sweater with No Undershirt Hell...
N: Satan stops and looks down at the dogs.
C: SATAN
D: What is this?
C: PHOBOS
D: What do you mean, your Unholiness?
C: SATAN
D: You’re lying. I know because I invented that. What are you hiding?
N: Phobos and Morphos snap under his glare.
C: MORPHOS
D: We’ll tell you, but you have to promise you won’t get mad.
C: SATAN
D: I promise.
C: PHOBOS
D: We pushed Bub into the portal and sent him to Earth.
E: sheepish
N: Satan grits his teeth with rage and SHOVES BOTH DOGS OFF THE LEDGE. They scream as they fall hundreds of feet till they can’t be heard anymore. POP! POP! Both of them reappear on the ledge.
C: MORPHOS PHOBOS
D: Ow! I landed on a fire hydrant.
E: CONT'D
C: SATAN
D: When?
C: MORPHOS
D: Two days ago.
C: SATAN
D: Then he’s only got two left.
N: Satan walks away.
C: SATAN
D: Come on.
E: CONT'D
C: PHOBOS
D: Where?
C: SATAN
D: Where else? Earth. We’re getting my dog back.
N: He SLIPS A RING ON HIS FINGER. It has a BLACK AMETHYST at its center. The dogs scamper behind him, leaving poor Hank to his fate.
S: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Tomàs holds Bub on a leash as the girls get out of the van and head toward the building. Jenni carries her dummy, Lulu.
C: GRACE
D: You’re really bringing the dog to school?
C: TOMÀS
D: You saw what he did last night. I can’t leave him alone in the house.
N: Bub stares up at the PENDANT Grace is wearing.
C: BUB
D: Gimme that black amethyst and I’ll leave you alone forever.
N: He jumps up on Grace, trying to reach the pendant.
C: GRACE
D: Get off!
N: Tomàs hands her a Post-It.
C: TOMÀS
D: Here’s the address for the trainer. You’re gonna have to take him after school.
C: GRACE
D: Why do I have to do it?
C: TOMÀS
D: Jenni’s got rehearsal for the talent show and I have a staff meeting... where they’ll probably yell at me for being late on my first day.
N: Jenni sees that her dad is stressed out.
C: JENNI
D: Don’t worry, Dad. I have a feeling once you see tomorrow night’s talent show, you’ll feel much better.
E: coy
C: TOMÀS
D: That’s very sweet, Jenni.
C: BUB
D: Boy, you are really putting a lot of weight on that talent show.
E: to Jenni
N: As they near the building, he looks up and sees a giant statue of the school’s mascot: BERNIE THE ST. BERNARD. It’s a caricature with floppy ears and a silly long tongue.
C: BUB
D: That’s just offensive.
E: CONT'D
N: They reach the door.
C: TOMÀS
D: All right. Grace, Jenni, you are strong, fierce young women and you’re gonna take this school by storm. Family high-five!
C: JENNI
D: Woo hoo!
N: Jenni gives him an enthusiastic high-five. Grace grimaces as she gives a begrudging one.
S: EXT. SOCCER FIELD - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Tomàs rushes out onto the field. He carries his gear bag. A first period P.E. class of 12 year-old STUDENTS are already waiting.
C: TOMÀS
D: Hey, guys!
C: STUDENT #1
D: You’re late.
C: TOMÀS
D: Yup. Sorry about that. Won’t happen again. I’m Coach Peña. Why don’t we get started with--
N: Another kid raises his hand.
C: TOMÀS
D: Yes?
E: CONT'D
C: STUDENT #2
D: I heard the police were at your house last night?
C: TOMÀS
D: Wow. This is a small town. That was just a misunderstanding.
C: STUDENT #3
D: I heard he murdered someone.
E: to the other kids
C: STUDENT #1
D: Are you a serial killer?
C: TOMÀS
D: Whoa! No. I am not a serial killer. I can’t believe I have to say this.
E: to himself
C: STUDENT #2
D: So, you just killed one person?
C: TOMÀS
D: I didn’t kill anyone. Now, no more talk about murderers or serial killers. I’m just an ordinary dad and soccer coach.
N: He unzips his gear bag and begins tossing jerseys to the students.
C: TOMÀS
D: Let’s get these jerseys on and start some drills.
E: CONT'D
N: As the kids unfold the jerseys, they react with horror as they see they are all torn up and SPLATTERED WITH BLOOD-LIKE RED PAINT thanks to Bub’s exploits the previous night.
C: TOMÀS
D: That’s just great.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. TOMÀS’S OFFICE - SAME
N: Bub’s leash is tied to a metal coat rack in Tomàs’s new office alongside the gym. Among the jackets and uniforms is the school’s MASCOT COSTUME: a large-headed Bernie the St. Bernard.
C: BUB
D: I don’t have time for this. I’ve gotta find Grace and get that thing off her neck.
N: He strains against the leash and the coat rack moves slightly.
C: BUB
D: Maybe if I just...
E: CONT'D
N: He pulls harder. Finally, the rack topples over. The end of the leash yanks free... but KNOCKS LOOSE THE MASCOT HEAD WHICH LANDS DIRECTLY ON BUB’S. He can see through the eye holes but can’t shake it off him.
C: BUB
D: Aw, come on! Ugh. Smells like teen spirit in here.
E: CONT'D then
S: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Bub walks down the hall wearing the oversized cartoon head.
C: BUB
D: Grace! Where are you?!
N: He peers in a few classroom windows but can’t find her. A JANITOR turns a corner, heading his way. Bub ducks into a storage closet, then realizes the mascot dog’s nose is caught in the door. At the last second, he yanks it inside. The janitor passes, none the wiser.
C: BUB
D: Whew.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. GRACE’S CLASS - SAME
N: Grace sits bored in English class as her teacher, MR. ANDERTON, is giving a lecture on Dante’s “Inferno.” Grace looks at her fellow students. They all appear very “normal.” One girl glances over at her. Trying to make a connection with her, Grace nods to the teacher and makes a “sleeping” face. The other girl frowns, not amused, and goes back to taking notes. Just then, unnoticed by the students, the Bernie the St. Bernard head pops up in the window of the door.
C: MR. ANDERTON
D: ...Cerberus, the three-headed hellhound, would guard the gates of Hades to prevent the damned from escaping...
C: BUB
D: Oh, that guy. So arrogant. Except for the left head. He was all right. Grace! Over here!
E: then, noticing
N: Grace looks around at the quiet yip. There’s something familiar about it. Sure enough, she spots Bub, wearing the giant mask, jumping up and down outside the door.
C: GRACE
D: What the--?
E: to herself
N: She raises her hand.
C: MR. ANDERTON
D: Oh, Grace. Our new student. I’d love to hear what you think about Dante.
C: GRACE
D: Can I go to the bathroom?
C: MR. ANDERTON
D: Sure.
E: disappointed
S: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Grace removes the mascot head from Bub as she hurries him down the hall.
C: BUB
D: Free at last! Hey, I just came from this way. Don’t take me back there!
E: then
C: GRACE
D: You’re gonna get my dad fired.
C: BUB
D: You don’t understand. I can’t leave without that necklace.
N: Bub looks at her with pleading eyes.
C: GRACE
D: What is it? What do you want?
C: BUB
D: That! The amethyst!
N: He “points” with his paw at the pendant.
C: GRACE
D: What? My uniform?
C: BUB
D: Yeah, I want to dress like a Catholic school girl.
E: sarcastic
C: GRACE
D: This?
E: touching her necklace
N: Bub seems to be finally getting through to her.
C: BUB
D: For Satan’s sake, YES!
N: But just then they are interrupted:
C: CODY
D: Whoa. You swiped Bernie’s head?
E: O.S.
N: They turn to see three teens, CODY, LINDSAY and OWEN, sitting under the stairwell, ditching class. Their uniforms are untucked. These are clearly the “bad” kids of the school. Grace looks down at the mascot head under her arm.
C: GRACE
D: Uh--
C: CODY
D: That’s classic.
C: GRACE
D: Oh, thanks.
C: BUB
D: I’m the one who did it.
C: LINDSAY
D: Cute dog. How do you get to bring him to school?
C: GRACE
D: We just got him and my dad’s the new soccer coach--
N: During the following, Bub tries repeatedly to jump up on Grace and grab the pendant. She shoves him off.
C: OWEN
D: Weren’t the cops at your house last night?
C: CODY
D: What’s up with that?
C: GRACE
D: Oh, well, it was--
C: LINDSAY
D: Oh my god, do you remember when the cops raided Dylan’s party and we were all wasted?
E: to Owen
N: They laugh. Grace chuckles awkwardly.
C: BUB
D: Wow. What a great story. So many twists and turns.
E: sarcastic
N: Grace hunts for something she can say to impress these kids.
C: GRACE
D: Hey, I heard you can’t get beer here on Sundays.
C: OWEN
D: It’s like the dumbest rule ever.
C: GRACE
D: Guess you just gotta drink twice as much on Saturday, right?
N: The kids stare at her for a beat, then laugh.
C: CODY
D: Hey, we were about to ditch and get tacos at Jack-in-the-Box. You wanna come?
C: GRACE
D: Um...
N: Bub jumps up on Grace again.
C: GRACE
D: I should probably get him back.
E: CONT'D
C: LINDSAY
D: That’s cool. What’s your name?
C: GRACE
D: Grace.
C: LINDSAY
D: I’m Lindsay. That’s Cody and Owen. Give me your number. Maybe we’ll chill sometime.
C: GRACE
D: Okay.
N: She hands over her phone. Grace is pleased. Maybe she’s found a clique.
S: INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY
N: Jenni sits at a table with Lulu, her dummy, practicing her act.
C: JENNI
D: Hey, Jenni? Yes, Lulu? What did the right eye say to the left eye? I don’t know, Lulu. What did the right eye say to the left eye?
E: Lulu voice normal voice Lulu voice normal voice
N: She suddenly hears WHISPERS and looks up to see several kids are staring at the new girl talking to her wooden doll.
C: JENNI
D: Between us, something smells.
E: CONT'D weakly, Lulu voice
N: Self-conscious, she stuffs Lulu in her backpack.
S: EXT. TAR PIT PARK - DAY
N: A HOMELESS MAN sits with a cup of coins in front of him. His cardboard sign reads “Spare Change?” He looks up as he sees bubbles forming on the surface of the tar pit. Suddenly, THREE HEADS EMERGE from the goo: one human, two dog. The black forms rise eerily from out of the black liquid until we can see it’s a NOW-MORTAL SATAN with his two mortal dogs, Phobos and Morphos. Their eyes have lost their demonic glow. The tar-covered trio walk calmly past the Homeless Man. Satan regards his sign.
C: SATAN
D: Don’t mind if I do.
N: Satan empties the coins into his hand and continues on. He looks down at his filthy suit.
C: SATAN
D: I can’t walk around like this.
E: CONT'D
N: He notices an OLD NAVY store nearby.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Satan emerges from the store wearing a slim-fit bright blue polo shirt and a pair of tapered khaki chinos. Morphos and Phobos marvel at his new look.
C: PHOBOS
D: You clean up nice, boss.
N: Satan doesn’t respond.
C: MORPHOS
D: He can’t understand you up here. We’re all mortals, remember?
C: PHOBOS
D: Really? You suck, Satan!
E: then
N: The two dogs laugh.
C: PHOBOS
D: This is fun.
E: CONT'D
C: SATAN
D: We need to figure out where Bub went after he came out of there. Start sniffing around.
C: MORPHOS
D: Aye, aye, Captain Douchebag!
N: They laugh some more. Satan notices a trail of dog tracks on the sidewalk leading out of the linen store.
C: SATAN
D: Did you make these?
N: The dogs shake their heads. Satan follows the tracks into the street where they abruptly end.
C: SATAN
D: Where did he go?
E: CONT'D
N: He looks around and sees the newsstand and the gum-chewing dude from earlier. He heads over.
C: SATAN
D: You there.
E: CONT'D
C: NEWSSTAND GUY
D: Yeah?
C: SATAN
D: Did you happen to see a dog covered in tar around here? About two days ago?
C: NEWSSTAND GUY
D: Oh, yeah. He got hit by a car.
N: Satan gasps.
C: MORPHOS
D: Yes!
C: NEWSSTAND GUY
D: I think he was okay, though.
C: MORPHOS
D: Dang it!
C: SATAN
D: What happened to him?
C: NEWSSTAND GUY
D: I think the guy who was driving took him to the vet.
C: SATAN
D: Thank you.
C: NEWSSTAND GUY
D: No worries.
N: Satan notices a newspaper headline: “SINKHOLE KILLS DOZENS AT KLAN RALLY.”
C: SATAN
D: It’s gonna be a busy week at the office.
N: He heads off.
S: EXT. ROLAND’S BACKYARD - LATER
N: Grace stands with Bub alongside a few other DOG OWNERS and their pets. The trainer, ROLAND, 40’s, soft-spoken but intense, holds court.
C: ROLAND
D: Welcome, I’m Roland. I’m glad to see many of you returning as well as some new faces.
C: GRACE BUB
D: I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be here.
E: to herself to himself
N: Bub looks down the line of dogs. Most of them gaze up at Roland attentively.
C: ROLAND
D: Before we start, I’d like to ask all owners to remove any bracelets or jewelry. Anything that might make a jingling sound. Dogs are sensitive to high-pitched sounds.
N: Grace shrugs and removes her pendant.
C: BUB
D: There it is.
N: She zips it into a pocket of her backpack and sticks it in a cubby by the house. Bub immediately goes for the backpack but Grace pulls on his leash.
C: BUB
D: Ow! Y’know, you’re a real piece of--
E: CONT'D
C: ROLAND
D: Let me make one thing clear. I am not here to “train” your dogs. I am here to help you forge an emotional connection with your animal. Because when a dog knows you love him, he will want to serve you.
C: BUB
D: An emotional connection between a dog and a person? Yeah, right.
N: A golden retriever, ROXY, hears him.
C: ROXY
D: Do you mind? Roland is talking.
C: BUB
D: I just don’t understand this. People keep dogs around because they’re useful. Not because they love them.
N: A shivering teacup Pomeranian, JASPER, chimes in.
C: JASPER
D: What am I useful for? I get seizures from sunlight.
N: An ancient bulldog, LOUISE, speaks up.
C: LOUISE
D: I can barely walk or see. If he didn’t love me, why would he spend all that money keeping me alive?
E: re: her owner
N: Bub considers this. This is uncharted territory for him.
C: ROLAND
D: Let’s try an exercise. Tamborine, can you come up, please?
N: A SHIH TZU, TAMBORINE, proudly trots up.
C: ROLAND
D: Tamborine is one of my prized students. There’s a level of real trust between us.
E: CONT'D
C: TAMBORINE
D: Love you, Roland.
N: Roland takes a TREAT from a pouch on his belt and places it on the dog’s snout.
C: ROLAND
D: Tamborine won’t eat the treat until I give her permission to.
C: BUB
D: Cuck alert!
C: ROLAND
D: Because she trusts that I will give it to her--
N: Suddenly, Bub steps forward and eats the treat off the other dog’s nose.
C: TAMBORINE
D: Hey!
C: BUB
D: I did you a favor. You looked ridiculous.
C: ROLAND
D: What is your dog’s name?
E: to Grace
C: GRACE
D: Lucky.
C: ROLAND
D: Will you bring Lucky forward, please?
N: Grace steps forward with Bub.
C: ROLAND
D: Let’s try a trust exercise.
E: CONT'D
C: BUB
D: Sure. You wanna fall backwards and see if I catch you?
N: Roland holds a treat in his hand.
C: ROLAND
D: Now, Lucky, you’re not to eat this treat until I--
N: Bub gulps down the treat from his hand. Grace and the other dog owners chuckle. Roland smiles patiently.
C: ROLAND
D: Okay, let’s try this again.
E: CONT'D
N: He takes another treat from his pouch, this time holding it higher above Bub’s head.
C: ROLAND
D: You will get the treat when you show me that--
E: CONT'D
N: But Bub jumps up, using Tamborine’s back like a springboard, and snatches up the treat in midair.
C: BUB
D: I can do this all day.
N: Roland’s smile gets a bit tighter as he takes another treat from his pouch and holds it even higher.
C: ROLAND
D: Lucky, you’re not to take the treat until--
N: Bub head-butts Roland in the crotch. The trainer doubles over and Bub grabs the treat.
C: BUB
D: I thought this class would be boring but it’s pretty fun.
N: Roland stands up, clearly annoyed now. He takes out another treat from the pouch, grips it tightly with one hand and holds the other protectively in front of his groin.
C: GRACE
D: Come on, Lucky.
C: BUB
D: No, no, it’s okay. I got this.
C: ROLAND
D: I will not stop drilling you until you obey--
N: Bub suddenly looks past Roland and BARKS WILDLY.
C: BUB
D: Behind you! Your house is on fire!
N: Roland turns to see what Bub is barking at. Bub lunges forward, grabbing Roland’s belt pouch and yanking it down. Treats fall everywhere as the trainer’s pants fall to his ankles. Roland lands on his hands and knees as Bub mounts him from behind and begins vigorously humping away.
C: BUB
D: And I will not stop drilling you until you obey!
E: CONT'D
N: Grace laughs in spite of herself.
T: INTERNAL CUT TO:
S: EXT. ROLAND'S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER
N: The dog owners and their pets have broken into small groups to practice on an obstacle course. Roland, pants back on, stands with Grace and Bub.
C: ROLAND
D: I’m afraid Lucky will never be an emotional support animal. He seems incapable of trust. And without that there’s no way for dog and owner to become close.
C: BUB
D: I just need to get close enough to grab that freakin’ pendant.
C: GRACE
D: Sorry, Lucky. Looks like you’re going back to the shelter.
C: BUB
D: No! I’ve only got two days left!
N: He looks around the yard, seeing dogs and their owners happily bonding as they build trust. He makes a decision.
C: BUB
D: Only way I’m gonna get that necklace from her is if I get her to trust me. You want me to play the game, you fascist? Watch this.
E: CONT'D then, to Roland
N: And with that, he runs over to the obstacle course, EFFORTLESSLY ACING EACH CHALLENGE. He climbs a ramp, slides down a slide, slaloms the training poles and jumps through a series of hoops.
C: BUB
D: I’m literally jumping through hoops here.
E: CONT'D
N: Grace and Roland watch with shock. Bub returns and nudges Roland’s treat pouch. Tentatively, the trainer holds out a treat. But instead of eating it, Bub flips it up onto his own nose and waits.
C: BUB
D: You want me to sit? Roll over? Do your taxes?
E: CONT'D
N: He sits and rolls over, balancing the treat as he goes.
C: BUB
D: Hind legs? You got it. What else do these losers do? Oh right, shake.
E: CONT'D balances on hind legs
N: He holds out a paw to Grace. She shakes it.
C: BUB
D: Good to meet you.
E: CONT'D
N: He offers the paw to Roland.
C: BUB
D: Now can I get my damn vest?
E: CONT'D
N: Blown away, Roland shakes his paw. Grace looks at Bub, impressed.
C: GRACE
D: Good dog.
N: For the first time, Bub doesn’t hate being called this.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Grace can’t help smiling as she walks Bub in his new red service dog vest home. Bub sings to the tune of Kool and the Gang’s “Celebration.”
C: BUB
D: I’m gonna get your pendant tonight/Let’s celebrate/It’s all right...
N: As they pass Karen’s house, they see the nosy neighbor and her mother peering out. Grace smiles and waves insincerely at the Karens and points to Bub’s new vest. The Karens grimace and close the blinds.
S: EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - THAT EVENING
N: Tomàs arrives home and gets out of the van. He looks curiously at a Mercedes parked in the driveway.
S: INT. PEÑA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Tomàs enters.
C: TOMÀS
D: Hey, girls, whose car is that outside?
C: FRANCISCO
D: It’s our rental.
E: O.S.
N: Tomàs turns, surprised to see his in-laws are sitting with the girls and Bub in the kitchen.
C: JENNI
D: Grandma and grandpa are here!
C: TOMÀS
D: I see that. Hey guys.
N: They exchange cordial hugs.
C: TOMÀS
D: I thought you were coming tomorrow. You didn’t give me a chance to clean up.
E: CONT'D glancing at the trashed living room
C: CARMEN
D: You think you could’ve cleaned that up in a day?
C: TOMÀS
D: It’s the new dog. We’re still training him.
C: FRANCISCO
D: And yet he’s a “service dog.” What service does he provide? Demolition?
C: BUB
D: I like this old guy. He’s mean.
N: Tomàs pushes the button on his answering machine. BEEP!
C: PRINCIPAL
D: Tomàs, it’s Principal Warren. If you can stop by my office tomorrow, I wanted to discuss what happened this morning. Some of the kids were a little freaked out. Thanks.
E: O.S. on machine
N: Tomàs looks at his in-laws, embarrassed.
C: TOMÀS
D: That was just a misunderstanding--
N: BEEP!
C: KAREN
D: Hi, this is Karen. I wanted you to know that I got an X-ray of my coccyx. It’s not broken but it is bruised. I’m assuming you’ll be paying for my physical therapy? Call me.
E: O.S. on machine
C: TOMÀS
D: She’s crazy.
C: BUB
D: Not sure why you thought it was a good idea to play these in front of your in-laws.
N: BEEP!
C: DR. CASEY
D: Uh, yes, hello. This is Dr. Casey, the vet. I’m sorry to have to tell you that your cat has passed away--
E: O.S.
N: Tomàs stops the machine.
C: TOMÀS
D: All right, that seems like enough messages.
N: Francisco and Carmen share a concerned look.
C: CARMEN
D: How worried do we need to be, Tomàs?
C: TOMÀS
D: Everything’s fine. It’s just a settling in period.
N: Jenni jumps in to defend her dad.
C: JENNI
D: You don’t need to worry. We love it here. Right, Grace?
N: Grace shrugs.
C: JENNI
D: I made a bunch of friends at school already, I love this house, and if we didn’t move here, we never would’ve met Lucky.
E: CONT'D
C: CARMEN
D: I’m happy to hear that, corazón.
C: TOMÀS
D: So, where are you guys staying? The Four Seasons Hopewell Junction?
E: joking
C: FRANCISCO
D: We thought we would stay with you if that’s all right.
C: TOMÀS
D: Uh... of course. I’ll make up the guest room.
C: GRACE
D: Well, I’ve got some homework.
E: grabs her backpack
C: BUB
D: I’ll go with her.
N: They exit.
C: JENNI
D: Don’t you want to watch me rehearse my show, Bub?
E: calling after
C: BUB
D: I’m good!
E: O.S.
S: INT. GRACE'S ROOM - LATER
N: Grace is getting ready for bed while Bub sits on the floor eyeing her backpack.
C: GRACE
D: I still don’t know how you did all that stuff today. Were you, like, a circus dog before we found you?
C: BUB
D: No, but there are a lot of clowns in Hell. And elephant trainers.
N: She turns away, giving Bub the opportunity to reach for her bag. He starts to unzip the pocket with his mouth, accidentally knocking over her guitar that leans against the wall.
C: BUB
D: Whoops.
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE
D: Careful.
N: She picks it up. Stares at it for a beat, lost in memories.
C: BUB
D: What’s wrong with you?
N: Forgetting he’s there, she sits on the bed and starts noodling around.
C: BUB
D: You’re not bad. Better than that Wagner guy.
E: CONT'D
N: She plays the opening bars of “The Wind” by Cat Stevens. Even Bub can’t help getting caught up in the melody. She finishes and puts the guitar back.
C: BUB
D: I’d clap, but ...these things don’t really do that.
E: CONT'D re: his paws
C: GRACE
D: My mom taught me that song.
C: BUB
D: This is the mom who died? Stupid question.
E: then
C: GRACE
D: She wasn’t like a normal mom, y’know?
E: MORE
C: GRACE
D: She was almost a kid in a grownup’s body. She was my best friend.
E: CONT'D beat
N: She sighs as she gets into bed and switches off the light. After a beat,
C: GRACE
D: Hey, Lucky? If you want, you can sleep up here.
E: CONT'D
N: She pats the bed.
C: BUB
D: Yeah?
N: He looks from her to the backpack.
C: BUB
D: I suppose I can spare a couple minutes.
E: CONT'D
N: He jumps up onto the bed. Grace puts an arm over him and scratches behind his ear.
C: BUB
D: Oh wow. That’s nice. That’s very nice.
E: CONT'D
N: As Grace drifts off, Bub sighs with pleasure.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. GRACE'S ROOM - LATER
N: Seeing Grace is asleep, Bub carefully shimmies out from under her arm and quietly steps down onto the floor. He goes to the backpack and unzips the pocket. He fishes out the pendant. It’s purple stone glimmers in the dim light. He slips it into a pocket on his vest and zips it shut. He moves to the door, glancing back one last time at Grace.
C: BUB
D: Good luck, kid.
N: BZZZZZ. BZZZZZ. Grace stirs as her cell phone vibrates on her night table.
C: BUB
D: Crap!
E: CONT'D
N: Bub freezes as she wakes up and looks at her phone. INSERT ON A TEXT from Lindsay: “Hey, it’s Linsday from school. If ur awake come meet us at Cody’s house. 233 Lester Court. Should b fun.” Grace considers for a beat, then looks at Bub.
C: GRACE
D: Wanna sneak out?
C: BUB
D: I was about to!
S: INT. CODY’S BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: Lindsay escorts Bub and Grace down the stairs to a finished basement rec room where Cody and Owen are playing quarters with red Solo cups. NOTE: We never see any of the teens actually drinking beer.
C: CODY
D: There she is! The mascot killer!
C: OWEN
D: And she brought her dog. Man, you bring that thing everywhere.
C: BUB
D: Not like I had a choice.
C: LINDSAY
D: He can play with Barf.
C: BUB
D: Huh?
C: CODY
D: Barf! Come!
N: An overweight yellow lab, BARF, shambles in with a hard rubber bone in his mouth that he begins chomping on.
C: BARF
D: ‘Sup?
C: BUB
D: Your name is “Barf”?
C: BARF
D: He was eight when he named me. The joke hasn’t aged well.
N: As Grace joins the others, Bub sits impatiently with the lab.
C: BUB
D: Is there any way out of here?
C: BARF
D: No. I would’ve found it.
N: Bub watches him slobber over the fake bone for a beat.
C: BUB
D: What are you doing there?
C: BARF
D: Eating my bone.
C: BUB
D: You know you’re not actually eating that, right?
C: BARF
D: Sure I am.
C: BUB
D: It’s hard rubber. You’ll never get through it.
C: BARF
D: I’ll get through it.
C: BUB
D: I promise you won’t.
C: BARF
D: Can you give me a break? This bone is all I have.
C: BUB
D: What about... Cody over there?
C: BARF
D: He doesn’t really play with me. His dad got me to try and teach him responsibility. But I don’t think it worked.
C: BUB
D: What, is he a bad kid?
C: BARF
D: He gets in trouble a lot. All of them do.
E: re: Owen and Linsday
C: BUB
D: Is that right?
N: He looks over at Grace, perhaps a little concerned for her.
C: OWEN
D: Why would you wanna leave Chicago and move to this dump?
E: to Grace
C: GRACE
D: Believe me. I didn’t want to.
C: CODY
D: Once my grandma dies, I’m gonna get a stack and move to Vegas.
C: GRACE
D: What about school?
N: The others laugh.
C: GRACE
D: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
E: CONT'D
C: OWEN
D: Pretty much this. And train dodging.
E: re: the drinking game
C: GRACE
D: Train dodging?
C: CODY
D: That’s why they call it Hopewell Junction. This place gets more trains than Grand Central.
C: LINDSAY
D: You should come tomorrow. It’s super fun.
C: GRACE
D: Maybe.
E: uncertain
C: OWEN
D: Less chit-chat. More drinky.
N: Lindsay offers Grace a Solo cup.
C: BUB
D: What’s in there?
E: to Barf
C: BARF
D: It ain’t water. I know ‘cause I tried it once.
N: Bub’s hackles go up. His new connection with Grace has triggered a long-dormant protective instinct.
C: BUB
D: Grace! Don’t drink that.
N: The kids look over at the barking dog.
C: OWEN
D: What’s with him?
C: GRACE
D: I don’t know.
N: Grace reluctantly takes the cup, but before she can sip,
C: BUB
D: You’re better than these goons. PUT THE CUP DOWN!
N: Bub’s bark becomes even louder.
C: CODY
D: He’s gonna wake up my dad.
C: GRACE
D: Quiet, Lucky!
E: embarrassed
C: BUB
D: What do I need to do to get you out of here?
N: He starts to SCOOT his butt along the rug.
C: LINDSAY
D: EWWW!
C: BARF
D: It’s a good rug for that, huh? Got some grit.
E: to Bub
C: CODY
D: What’s your dog’s problem?
E: to Grace
C: GRACE
D: Lucky, stop!
N: Cody tosses a couch cushion at Bub. But Bub dodges it and then tears into it, pulling out stuffing.
C: BUB
D: Time to go, Grace!
N: He barks some more.
C: GRACE
D: Shhh!
C: BUB
D: Oh, I’ll “shhh” all right. I’m gonna “shhh” all over this carpet.
N: He squats down, preparing to poop.
C: CODY
D: NO!
N: Grace puts down the cup and jumps to her feet. A cup of beer spills onto her sleeve. She grabs Bub and stops him from defecating.
C: GRACE
D: I don’t know why he’s acting like this. I should probably take him home.
C: BUB
D: Yeah you should.
C: LINDSAY
D: Well, come meet us tomorrow if you want.
C: CODY
D: Maybe leave Lucky at home.
C: OWEN
D: You sure he’s an emotional support dog?
N: Grace looks down at Bub. She’s actually relieved he’s getting her out of there.
C: GRACE
D: Yeah, I think he is.
N: She takes his leash and leads him up the stairs.
S: EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - DAWN
N: Grace and Bub quietly sneak into the house as the sun begins to rise.
S: INT. PEÑA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Grace tip-toes inside.

C: GRACE
D: Grandma and grandpa.
C: BUB
D: Oh, crap.
C: CARMEN
D: Are you just coming home now?
C: FRANCISCO
D: You were out all night?!
N: Before she can answer, Tomàs comes downstairs with Jenni.
C: TOMÀS
D: What’s going on? Grace? What are you doing up? And dressed?
C: CARMEN
D: Your daughter just came home.
C: TOMÀS
D: What? Where the heck were you?
C: GRACE
D: Out with some friends. I didn’t do anything bad.
C: BUB
D: Thanks to me.
C: CARMEN
D: She smells like beer!
E: sniffing
C: FRANCISCO
D: So, this is the kind of house you keep? You let your fifteen year-old daughter run around town?
E: to Tomás
C: TOMÀS
D: She snuck out. I had no idea. She’s never done anything like this before.
C: CARMEN
D: You’re her father. You’re supposed to know where she is.
C: TOMÀS
D: Thanks, Carmen. I know that.
C: CARMEN
D: I’m not sure you do.
C: TOMÀS
D: Okay, girls, upstairs. Grace, you’re grounded.
C: JENNI
D: But she’s gotta come to the talent show!
C: TOMÀS
D: Fine. She can come to the show but that’s it.
C: GRACE
D: Great. More punishment.
C: JENNI
D: Hey.
N: The girls head upstairs. Grace looks back at Bub. They exchange a sad look.
C: BUB
D: Sorry to leave you like this, Grace. But I gotta go.
N: As Tomàs continues to defend himself against Francisco and Carmen. Bub quietly makes his way toward an open window. He is just about to climb out when,
C: FRANCISCO
D: Look at this. You can’t even keep your dog in the house.
E: O.S.
N: Tomàs turns to see Bub halfway out the window.
C: BUB
D: Thats it. You’re on my “Shhh” list.
E: to Francisco
N: An exasperated Tomàs picks up the dog and sticks him in his crate, locking it behind him.
C: BUB
D: Satan help me.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. VET'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM -DAY
N: Satan enters with Phobos and Morphos. Old Dr. Casey approaches.
C: DR. CASEY
D: Hello, there. If you’re here to pick up the cat, I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news.
C: SATAN
D: What? No.
C: DR. CASEY
D: Whose cat was that? How can I help you?
E: to himself then
C: SATAN
D: I need you to examine my dogs. In another room.
E: eyeing his computer
C: DR. CASEY
D: Uh, anything I’m looking for in particular?
C: SATAN
D: ...rabies?
C: DR. CASEY
D: I can give them the shot. It’s a pretty painful one.
C: SATAN
D: That’s fine.
C: PHOBOS
D: Hey!
C: MORPHOS
D: There’s no rabies in Hell!
N: The vet leads the two dogs into the exam room, leaving Satan alone. Satan crosses to the computer and searches the patient log from two days ago. He scrolls down until he finds an entry: “Male canine, Lucky, struck by vehicle.” Included is the address of the Peña house.
C: SATAN
D: Looks like the Peñas are about to feel the pain-ya.
S: INT. VET'S EXAM ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Satan walks in to find Dr. Casey holding an intimidating needle over a terrified Phobos.
C: SATAN
D: Phobos, Morphos, come!
C: DR. CASEY
D: I haven’t given them the shot yet.
N: The two dogs look pleadingly at Satan. After a beat,
C: SATAN
D: I’ll wait.
N: The dogs’ faces fall.
S: INT. PEÑA HOUSE - LATER

D: Come on, guys. The show starts in less than an hour.
E: O.S.
N: Jenni comes downstairs.
C: FRANCISCO
D: Maybe I should drive.
C: TOMÀS
D: Why?
C: FRANCISCO
D: You’ve hit two dogs in as many days.
C: TOMÀS
D: It was the same dog. Not that that makes it better... All right. You can drive if you want.
E: beat
N: Grace comes downstairs looking upset.
C: GRACE
D: Has anyone seen my pendant? It was in my bag but I can’t find it.
N: ANGLE ON BUB in his crate. Hearing this, he feels a slight pang of guilt as he glances at the pocket in his vest.
C: CARMEN
D: Maybe you lost it while you were out.
C: TOMÀS
D: We’ll look for it when we get back. We’re late.
N: Feeling the bad vibes in the room, Jenni holds up her ventriloquist dummy.
C: JENNI
D: Hope you guys are ready to laugh!
E: Lulu’s voice
C: GRACE
D: I am so ready.
E: deadpan
N: The family heads out.
C: BUB
D: Wait! What about me! I’ve only got five hours left till I’m a mortal forever!
N: The front door closes.
C: BUB
D: You’re killing me! You’re literally killing me.
E: CONT'D
N: He shoves his paw through the bars and tries to wiggle the latch open, but he can’t reach.
C: BUB
D: I can’t get it from inside.
E: CONT'D
N: His eyes scan the room, landing on an open BAG OF SUNFLOWER SEEDS on a table. An idea strikes him. He leans toward a wall vent and shouts:
C: BUB
D: Hey, rat! What’s his name? Sebastian?! Can you hear me?!
E: CONT'D to himself yells
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT. JENNI'S ROOM - SAME
N: Sebastian sits in his cage, manically scratching his ear with his foot a million times. Bub’s voice comes through a vent in the room.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: That you, Lucky?!
C: BUB
D: I need your help! You’ve gotta come down here and unlock something for me.
E: O.S.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’m on my way.
N: He gets in his wheel and starts running. Finally, he jumps out and looks around.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: That’s right. I’m in a cage!
E: CONT'D yells
C: BUB
D: Can you get out of it? ‘Cause I’ve got seeds down here!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Seeds?
E: perking up
C: BUB
D: Big bag of ‘em. I’d say about three ounces of pure sunflower!
N: Sebastian’s whole demeanor changes. He’s a man possessed.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I’ll be right there!
N: Like a T-1000, the hamster SQUISHES its face between the bars of the cage. He grunts sharply as his skull and body compress impossibly, allowing him to slip out of the cage.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Seeds.
E: CONT'D
N: He scampers off. The hamster runs down the hall and LEAPS from the top of the stairs, bouncing and rolling down the steps. He lands clumsily.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Seeds.
E: CONT'D
N: He tears into the living room and sees Bub in his crate.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Hi, Lucky. Where are the seeds?
E: CONT'D
C: BUB
D: Over there, but first you need to unlock my--
E: nods
N: But Sebastian is off, leapfrogging up onto the table and running right into the bag of seeds. Shells fly out of the bag as the hamster gorges himself, moaning in ecstasy.
C: BUB
D: Come on, man! You can do that after!
E: CONT'D
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Papa just needs a taste, then I’ll be right with you!
S: EXT. STREET - SAME
N: Satan and the dogs walk down the middle of the street, scanning addresses. They arrive outside the Peñas’ home.
C: SATAN
D: We’re here.
S: INT. PEÑA HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - SAME
N: At last, Sebastian has finished the bag of seeds. He stumbles out, slipping on his own discarded shells. He’s groggy from his “fix.”
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Whew. Papa needs to lie down.
E: slurring
C: BUB
D: NO! Papa needs to unlock this cage. Now!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: All right, all right...
N: He takes a step and FALLS off the table, landing on the rug. He cracks up laughing as he rolls around on his back.
C: BUB
D: It’s not that funny. Come on.
N: Still giggling, the hamster comes over to the cage. Through the FROSTED FRONT DOOR WINDOW we can see the outline of Satan standing outside. Sebastian climbs the front of the crate and unhooks the latch. Bub bursts out.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: There you go. Have I told you that I really respect you? You’re like a brother to me.
E: woozy
N: The DOORBELL RINGS.
C: BUB
D: Shh!
N: The front doorknob jiggles as Satan tries it from outside.
C: BUB
D: I gotta go.
E: CONT'D
N: As Bub runs toward the rear of the house, Satan peers through the kitchen window.
S: EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Just as Bub is about to cross into his view, Satan turns at the sound of...
C: KAREN
D: Excuse me!
N: Karen has marched across the street to confront this suspicious stranger and his dogs. She films the whole interaction on her phone.
C: KAREN
D: Can I help you?
E: CONT'D
C: SATAN
D: We’re fine.
C: KAREN
D: I don’t think you are fine. I can tell when someone is casing a joint.
C: SATAN
D: This is none of your business.
C: KAREN
D: Wrong again. This is exactly my business. Now, can I see some identification, please?
C: MORPHOS
D: What’s this chick’s problem?
N: Karen reacts to the dog’s growl.
C: KAREN
D: And those dogs need to be leashed. That’s it. I’m calling the sheriff. And I’m placing you under citizen’s arrest until he arrives.
S: EXT. PEÑA HOUSE, BACKYARD - SAME
N: Bub climbs out an open window and leaves the house. Sebastian waves down from the window.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So long, Lucky! I hope we meet again someday.
C: BUB
D: I wouldn’t hope for that if I were you.
S: EXT. PEÑA HOUSE - SAME
N: In the front yard, Satan is still with Karen. Phobos suddenly notices Bub walking a few dozen yards down the street.
C: PHOBOS
D: Boss, look!
N: Hearing Phobos bark, Satan looks.
C: SATAN
D: It’s Bub! Bub, wait!
N: He moves to go but Karen steps in his path. Bub, not hearing him, disappears around the corner.
C: KAREN
D: You are in my custody, sir.
E: dialing her phone
C: SATAN
D: Move! Do you have any idea who I am?
E: getting pissed
C: KAREN
D: Nope. Don’t care. We’re all the same under the eyes of the law. Hello, Sheriff Rogers?
E: into phone
C: SATAN
D: I AM THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS!
C: KAREN
D: And I am the head of the Neighborhood Watch!
E: into phone MORE
C: KAREN
D: I’ve got a man shouting at me and saying he’s the devil. I feel physically threatened.
E: CONT'D
C: SATAN
D: Get out of my way!
N: As Satan and the dogs attempt to push past her, she grabs the pepper spray from her holster and SPRAYS SATAN AND BOTH DOGS IN THE EYES.
C: SATAN
D: AGGGHHHH!
E: CONT'D
C: KAREN
D: Can’t take the heat, “Satan”?
N: Clutching his eyes, Satan runs off. Morphos and Phobos stumble behind him.
S: INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: The show is in progress. A 10th grade BOY is just finishing his magic performance. Tomàs sits beside Francisco, Carmen and Grace. His in-laws whisper-argue with Tomàs with Grace stuck in the middle.
C: CARMEN
D: None of this would’ve happened if you’d just stayed in the city like we asked.
C: TOMÀS
D: I told you. There were no jobs in the city. They filled mine when I left to take care of Isabel.
N: The crowd of parents applauds. Jenni comes on stage with Lulu.
C: JENNI
D: Hi, everyone. I’m Jenni Peña. And I’m Lulu. I sure hope this show goes well. Knock on wood.
E: Lulu voice
N: The dummy knocks on her own head.
C: FRANCISCO
D: You don’t need to work, Tomàs. We told you we’d take care of you and the girls.
C: TOMÀS
D: I’m their father. I can take care of them myself.
N: The argument is growing louder. Audience members begin to take notice. From the stage, Jenni notices her family arguing. She does her best to stay focused.
C: JENNI
D: Hey, Jenni. What kind of music is a balloon scared of? That’s easy. Pop music.
E: Lulu voice normal voice
C: CARMEN
D: Can you take care of them? Look what’s happening to Grace. This isn’t who she is. The girl is lost.
E: to Tomàs
C: TOMÀS
D: And do you think you’re helping when all you do is tear down her father?!
C: GRACE
D: You know I’m right here?! And you’re the ones who need help! I can’t take this anymore. I’m going outside.
E: getting up
C: TOMÀS
D: Grace, wait!
N: Jenni watches as Grace storms out of the auditorium. She sits on stage, her emotions boiling up to the surface. All these months of putting on a brave face have finally taken their toll.
C: JENNI
D: I hate this!
E: shouting
N: The audience watches, uncertain. Is this part of the act? Jenni pulls Lulu off her arm and shouts at the doll.
C: JENNI
D: I try to make everybody happy! I try to be positive and never complain and see the bright side of everything! Well, guess what? There is no bright side!
E: CONT'D
N: She throws Lulu to the floor.
C: JENNI
D: There’s just me and my stupid family and this stupid doll!
E: CONT'D
N: As Tomàs, the grandparents and the rest of the audience watch in silent shock, Jenni stomps repeatedly on Lulu’s head, DISLODGING HER JAW. Jenni screeches like a wild animal as she PULLS THE ARMS OFF LULU. She then picks up her stool and bashes Lulu until she is no more than a pulp of splinters and stuffing. She stands there for a beat, panting in the spotlight. Then, she sits in the pile of Lulu’s remains and hangs her head.
C: JENNI
D: I’m finished!
E: CONT'D
N: There’s a beat before the audience suddenly ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE.
S: EXT. RAIL YARD - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Still on edge, Grace walks into a mostly derelict train yard where Owen, Lindsay and Cody are hanging out on rusty lounge chairs and discarded crates.
C: LINDSAY
D: You made it! You okay? You look a little--
E: then
C: GRACE
D: Miserable?
C: LINDSAY
D: Yeah.
C: GRACE
D: That’s how I’m feeling.
C: OWEN
D: Congratulations. You are now officially a resident of Hopewell Junction.
C: CODY
D: And your timing is perfect.
N: He nods to a freight train engine approaching from a quarter mile off.
C: GRACE
D: How does this work exactly?
C: CODY
D: Watch and learn.
N: He steps up onto the tracks. The train sounds its horn as it nears.
C: GRACE
D: Isn’t this kinda dangerous?
C: CODY
D: Only if you don’t jump in time.
N: Cody does a Fortnite dance on the tracks as the train speeds closer. At the last moment, he jumps out of the way and the train whizzes by.
C: LINDSAY
D: I’m gonna give that an eight out of ten.
C: CODY
D: Come on! It got up to the Texaco sign!
N: They hear another train off in the distance.
C: OWEN
D: What do you say, Noob? You wanna show him how it’s done?
E: to Grace
N: Feeling numb and reckless, she shrugs.
C: GRACE
D: Why not?
N: She steps onto the tracks as the other kids cheer her on.
S: EXT. STREET - SAME
N: Bub runs down the road, heading to the tar pit park, he passes the rail yard. Glancing over, he’s surprised to see Grace standing on the train tracks.
C: BUB
D: Grace? The hell’s she doing?
N: Concerned, Bub heads in her direction.
S: EXT. RAIL YARD - CONTINUOUS
N: Taking a cue from Cody, Grace does her own little dance on the tracks. But as she does, her foot slips and her shoe becomes caught between the rail and the tie. She tries to pull it out but its lodged in there.
C: GRACE
D: Guys? I think my foot’s caught.
N: The train continues to bear down on them.
C: LINDSAY
D: Very funny.
C: GRACE
D: No, I’m serious!
N: The kids hurry over and try to pry her foot loose, to no avail.
C: CODY
D: It’s really stuck!
C: OWEN
D: Take her shoe off!
C: LINDSAY
D: I can’t!
E: trying
N: Increasingly panicked, Grace looks up at the approaching train. The engineer blows the horn repeatedly.
C: GRACE
D: Help me!
N: Just then, Bub arrives. He jumps onto the tracks and digs, like only a dog can, into the ballast beneath Grace’s shoe. With the train so close, the other kids freak out and retreat. But Bub stays the course until...
C: BUB
D: Got it! Come on!
N: He FREES HER FOOT AND THEY JUMP OUT OF THE WAY just as the train reaches them. As Grace and Bub catch their breath on the ground.
C: GRACE
D: Thank you.
C: BUB
D: You’re welcome. Do me a favor and don’t stand in front of any more trains, you dummy.
N: She throws her arms around him.
C: GRACE
D: I love you.
N: Words Bub didn’t even know he wanted to hear. But they hit home. He sighs.
C: BUB
D: I’m out of time, kid. I’m sorry.
N: And with that, he slips out of her grasp and runs off, leaving her confused. After a beat,
C: CODY
D: That’s definitely a nine out of ten.
N: Grace just looks at the threesome. She’s officially done with these idiots.
S: EXT. TAR PIT PARK - MINUTES LATER
N: Bub hurries into the park, passing the dinosaur statues and reaching the edge of the tar pits. He unzips the pouch on his vest with his teeth and pulls out Grace’s pendant. But as he does, the pendant opens and he finds himself looking at the photo of Grace and her mom.
C: BUB
D: I’m sure she’s got other priceless artifacts her mom gave her before she died...
E: torn
N: He holds the necklace over the tar which takes on an UNEARTHLY GLOW. But he can’t bring himself to drop it in.
C: BUB
D: Drop it, Bub. What’s wrong with you?
E: CONT'D
C: SATAN
D: Bub!
E: O.S.
N: The dog turns to see Satan, Morphos and Phobos have caught up with him. Bub’s eyes go wide with joy.
C: BUB
D: Satan!
C: SATAN
D: We’ve looked everywhere for you. I came up personally. And you know how I hate it up here.
N: Bub sets the pendant gently on a stone and runs toward Satan, leaping up and licking him affectionately. But Satan shoves him off.
C: SATAN
D: Ugh! What are you doing? Kissing me? That’s disgusting!
E: CONT'D
C: PHOBOS
D: Yeah, that’s pretty gross, man.
C: BUB
D: Aren’t you happy to see me? Didn’t you miss me?
E: to Satan
C: SATAN
D: That sort of thing may fly with the mortals, but I won’t tolerate any of that in Hell. Now, come on. Those people down there aren’t going to torture themselves.
N: He begins to lead a conflicted Bub toward the tar pit.
C: GRACE
D: There you are!
E: O.S.
N: He turns to find Grace has caught up to him.
C: BUB
D: Grace!
C: GRACE
D: Come on, boy. Let’s go home.
C: SATAN
D: Who are you?
C: GRACE
D: I’m his owner.
C: SATAN
D: I’m his owner. I have been since before the dawn of man. Now let’s go, Bub. We’re going into the tar pit.
E: then
N: Satan shows Bub the amethyst ring he wears.
C: GRACE
D: Okay, you just seem like a crazy person.
N: Bub stands between the two of them, not sure what to do.
C: SATAN
D: You’re not seriously considering staying with her. You’d be giving up boundless power and immortality.
C: BUB
D: Yeah, but... she loves me.
C: MORPHOS
D: Can you believe this guy?
C: PHOBOS
D: And he says we’re the dumb ones.
N: Bub turns his back on Satan and starts walking toward Grace.
C: SATAN
D: He’s not thinking straight. Hellhounds, take him!
N: Morphos and Phobos charge Bub, tackling him to the ground. Grace runs to his aid but Satan grabs her. The hellhounds square off against Bub.
C: BUB
D: Let her go!
E: to Satan
N: He tries to run to Grace but is overtaken by the dogs. He’s outmatched by the two.
C: MORPHOS
D: Not so tough here on Earth, are you?
C: PHOBOS
D: Face it, Bub. You’re outnumbered.
N: Suddenly, Bub remembers something. He lets out a HOWL that echoes over the town. After a moment, we hear a RETURN HOWL.
C: MORPHOS
D: What is that?
C: BUB
D: Some friends I made on the inside.
C: PHOBOS
D: Inside of what?
N: All at once, the alpha dogs from the shelter, Apricot, Snuggles and Heidi burst out of the woods to Bub’s aid.
C: APRICOT
D: You called?
C: BUB
D: Fellas, let me introduce you to Heidi, Snuggles and Apricot. They’re tougher than they sound.
E: to the hellhounds realizing
N: The big dogs charge at Morphos and Phobos, trouncing the hellhounds. There follows an epic battle that ranges over the backs and tails of the artificial dinosaurs. Finally, the dog fight spills out onto the street. ANGLE ON a pickup truck speeding toward the dogs. The DRIVER spots them and SWERVES to avoid hitting them. The truck goes up onto the grass and SLAMS INTO the largest of the fake dinosaurs, a brachiosaurus. It teeters, then falls... Grace sees where the statue is headed: directly for Bub.
C: GRACE
D: Look out!
N: Too late. The head of the dinosaur lands on top of Bub, knocking him down.
C: SATAN
D: NO!
N: The dogs stop fighting as they see what has happened. Grace runs over to Bub and pulls him free. He’s not moving.
C: GRACE
D: Come on, Lucky! Wake up!
N: But Bub is still. She listens for a heartbeat but hears nothing.
C: SATAN
D: Who will I replace him with?! Not you fools.
E: to Phobos and Morphos
N: Morphos and Phobos exchange a hurt look. But Grace is only focused on Bub.
C: GRACE
D: You don’t understand, boy. I can’t lose you too. Please come back. Please.
N: Grace begins to cry. The full weight of her mom, the move, everything is now bearing down on her. Heidi, Snuggles and Apricot maintain a respectful distance as they too mourn the loss of Bub. Satan regards the scene with nothing more than annoyance. He confirms he has the amethyst ring on his finger.
C: SATAN
D: What a waste. Now he’s stuck in heaven. Get in the tar. We’re going home.
E: to the hellhounds
N: As the dogs reluctantly join Satan and walk toward the pit, Grace buries her head in Bub’s fur. Suddenly, the dog TAKES A BREATH.
C: GRACE
D: Lucky?!
N: Bub opens his eyes and looks up at her.
C: BUB
D: I feel like I got hit by a dinosaur.
C: GRACE
D: Lucky!
C: BUB
D: You were right about your mom, Grace. She’s pretty awesome. She told me I had more work to do down here. But of course, you don’t understand a word I’m saying.
N: She hugs him, overjoyed.
C: BUB
D: Or maybe you do.
E: CONT'D
N: Without warning, Bub is yanked from Grace’s arms by Satan.
C: GRACE
D: Hey!
C: SATAN
D: He belongs to me.
C: BUB
D: Put me down! I don’t want to go!
N: But Satan marches forward. The tar, reacting to his black amethyst ring, begins to glow again. Satan steps into the tar as Grace grabs hold of Bub’s hind legs.
C: SATAN
D: Sic her!
E: to hellhounds
N: But Phobos and Morphos, who have yet to enter the pit, look conflicted. Deep beneath their tough exteriors, they too have hearts. Satan shoves Grace back. She falls, momentarily stunned as Satan takes another step into the tar.
C: SATAN
D: This is what you were meant to do!
E: CONT'D to Bub
C: BUB
D: Not anymore it isn’t.
N: Bub bites Satan’s hand. He recoils, releasing Bub and falling back into the tar.
C: SATAN
D: NOOO!
N: He disappears into the black ooze. It’s ominously silent.
C: MORPHOS
D: You know he’s gonna come back for you.
C: BUB
D: I doubt it.
N: And with that, Bub spits something out onto the ground. It’s SATAN’S BLACK AMETHYST RING. Morphos and Phobos gape at Bub.
C: PHOBOS
D: Did you just--?
C: BUB
D: Kill Satan? Looks that way.
C: MORPHOS
D: I guess that means we’re--
C: PHOBOS
D: Useless?
C: BUB
D: It means you’re free.
N: The hellhounds look at each other, confused.
C: MORPHOS
D: I don’t really know what a free dog does.
C: APRICOT
D: Come with us. We can teach you.
C: SNUGGLES
D: We roam the land, sleeping whenever we want, eating garbage and sniffing butts.
C: PHOBOS
D: It sounds amazing.
C: HEIDI
D: You have no idea.
N: With that, the five dogs happily bound off into the woods. Grace gets to her feet and sees Bub pick up her pendant from the rock he’d set it on. He brings it back to her.
C: GRACE
D: My pendant!
C: BUB
D: Sorry about that. Not exactly something an emotional support animal would do.
C: GRACE
D: You ready to go home?
C: BUB
D: I’ve been waiting my whole life. I just didn’t know it.
N: Dog and girl head out of the park together.
C: BUB
D: I hope they don’t clean out that tar pit too often...
E: CONT'D to himself
S: INT. PEÑA HOUSE - LATER
N: Bub and Grace enter to find the rest of the family waiting.
C: CARMEN
D: She’s here!
N: Tomàs runs over and hugs Grace.
C: TOMÀS
D: You can’t keep disappearing on us like that!
C: GRACE
D: It’s the last time. I promise.
C: FRANCISCO
D: Moving here was a mistake. It’s time to bring the girls home!
E: to Tomàs
C: GRACE
D: No, Grandpa. This is home. As long as Dad, Jenni and I are together, we’ll always be home.
N: Bub barks. Grace smiles.
C: GRACE
D: And Lucky. Lucky’s part of this family now too.
E: CONT'D
N: The adults are all surprised by her earnestness. They haven’t seen this side of her since Isabel died.
C: GRACE
D: But you guys need to do your part. I know your hearts are in the right place but you gotta give Dad a break. Mom loved him more than anything. She’d want you to do the same.
E: CONT'D to her grandparents
N: Francisco and Carmen nod, humbled by this.
C: CARMEN
D: Is this really what you girls want? You want to stay here?
N: Grace looks at Jenni who nods, then at Tomàs.
C: GRACE
D: I hear there’s a pretty good music program at the school.
N: Tomàs gives her a warm smile.
C: TOMÀS
D: By the way, your sister won first prize at the talent show.
C: JENNI
D: They thought my meltdown was part of the act.
E: proudly
C: BUB
D: Oh, man. I missed your meltdown? I knew it was coming.
C: TOMÀS
D: Since we’re staying, how about we start fixing this place up?
N: He gestures to the still paint-splattered living room.
C: TOMÀS
D: Girls, grab paint and brushes. Francisco and Carmen, maybe you can find a carpet cleaner?
E: CONT'D
C: JENNI
D: What are you gonna do?
C: TOMÀS
D: I need to call my students’ parents and convince them I’m not a serial killer.
C: BUB
D: Speaking of serial killers, I wonder what Hell is gonna be like now that the big boss is gone.
N: We MOVE DOWN THROUGH THE FLOOR, through miles of earth until we land in
S: INT. HELL, FILING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Dennis, the scowling C.E.O. from the beginning of the movie, sticks a folder in a filing cabinet. We PULL BACK to see it was the last of the thousands and thousands of piles he had to file.
C: DENNIS
D: I’m done. Hello?
E: nothing
N: He tentatively opens the door of the room and peeks outside.
C: DENNIS
D: I finished filing! Anybody here?
E: CONT'D
N: No answer. He shrugs and slips out the door, as we
T: CUT TO BLACK.
N: THE END
