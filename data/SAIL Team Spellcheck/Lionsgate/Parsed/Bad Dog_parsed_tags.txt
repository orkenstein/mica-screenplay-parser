D:           Specifically your hell, Dennis.

N: But something makes Dennis stop dead in his tracks. Fifty

0: 
N: ON DENNIS as he crouches behind dividers and crawls under
N: desks. He peers up to see the dogs sniffing around nearby.
0: 
N: Dennis spots an elevator and army crawls toward it. While
N: Phobos and Morphos search cluelessly around the room, Bub
N: clambers up onto a file cabinet, giving him a bird’s eye view
N: of the room. His eyes narrow as he sees Dennis.
0:
