N:     Even for a place as vast and unpopulated as deep space, this
N:     particular area seems like East Bumblefuck. No ships fly by,
N:     no fancy planets with those ooh-ahh CGI rings...
0: 
N:     Nope. Nothing. Nothing but the same zillion boring stars you
N:     always see in the opening of one of these-- hold on... wait.
0: 
N:     Some of the stars SHIFT, and we realize that in the center of
N:     the screen, in a long vertical strip, those blinky lights
N:     weren't stars but ACTUAL BLINKY LIGHTS...

N:     The STRUCTURE is slowly TURNING, revealing that we were
N:     looking sideways at something quite massive. A SPACE STATION,
N:     brutish and foreboding.

N:     TITLE: PRISON COLONY "HEPHAESTUS"

N:     And as it rotates further, we see now that the entire station

N:     HAIR. Greasy, unkempt hair hanging down in front of a face we
N:     can barely make out. Just an eye. Man? Woman? A water drop
N:     hits the prisoner's face, not sure if it's water torture or
N:     bad plumbing.

N:     REVEAL: the PRISONER SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR by ANTI-GRAV CUFFS
N:     around the wrists. Jesus pose. Wearing a particularly
N:     unflattering ATLAS INMATE GARMENT.
0: 
N:     This is LILITH, 40. It's clear from her hair, her skin... but
N:     mostly the way she just hangs there without panic or anger...
N:     that she's been here for a LONG TIME.
0: 
N:     On her RIGHT FOREARM, a TATTOO. A simple shape of an ARCH,
N:     like an upside-down U. Or V. She stares at it. Remembering to
N:     remember something. Or perhaps someone. And then, before we
N:     hear or see anything, her EYES SHIFT quickly, full alert.
0: 
N:     We hear the metallic clanking of robot GUARDS approaching,
N:     followed by an electronic keypad, then a loud BUZZ.

N:     The cuffs release, and Lilith drops, landing on the ground.
N:     She looks up through blurry eyes and sees two sad looking
N:     Atlas-branded robots. One looks like a garbage can with an
N:     eyeball on a wiry, metal stick.
0: 
N:     The robots help her stand. It's clear she has been dangling
N:     there for a while.

N:     They pass prisoners in their cells. Lilith makes eye contact
N:     with ATHENA, 30s, who holds her arm in a high-tech torture
N:     device in the wall, gritting her teeth in pain. Athena wears
N:     a headband that collects sweat and drains it into tubes which
N:     feed into the floor. A digital display ticks days off her
N:     9,374 day sentence. Athena, unable to take any more, pulls
N:     her arm out and drops to the floor.

N:     A door SLIDES OPEN with a hiss. Lilith is nudged into the
N:     room by the Mantis robot with a little BZZT. Before she can
N:     turn around the door closes behind her. Her cuffs pop off.

N: She SQUINTS because it's absurdly bright in here. Yes, from
N: the lights over head, but also... almost everything is white.
N: White floors, white desk, white walls. There's a chair for
N: her at the table. Large windows show the star field outside.
N: And on the other side of the desk... A MAN. Dressed to match
N: the room. Perfectly dapper.
0: 
N: He "flips" through the pages of a HOLOGRAPHIC INMATE FILE. His
N: right hand is cybernetic. Designed to be appreciated. And yes,
N: the file says ATLAS on it. So does the wall behind his head.
N: And another one. "ATLAS... At last."

E:                    (when she does)
D:              Lilith... "The Phantom of Promethea."
D:              "The Menoetian Night Cat." The "Eden-
D:              5 She-Ghost." I rather like that one.
D:              Still, a bit grandiose for a thief.
0: 
N: He goes back to her file. In the images, holographic footage
N: of Lilith breaking into various places, taken from
N: surveillance cameras. We see images of items now. Statues,
N: gems, metallic bricks, computer chips...

C:                          THE MAN
D:              Fifteen bounties on your head, forty
D:              different law enforcement entities
D:              after you... seems you can find and
D:              steal anything-- no matter how
D:              protected. For a price, of course.
D:              But that isn't why you do it. Is it.
0: 
N: Something menacing in his voice there. Lilith tenses ever so
N: slightly. The Man notices. Almost delighted by it.

C:                          THE MAN
D:              Lilith-- I'm not here to judge you,
D:              we're long past that. I'm here to
D:              hire you.
0: 
N: And now he leans back, self-satisfied. And waits. Waits right
N: there in his seat, right under the word ATLAS. Lilith looks
N: at him. At the word. At him. Oh. Holy shit. He's--

E:                    (off his smug look)
D:              To... what, steal something?

C:                          ATLAS
D:              Not steal. Find. And not something.

N: He removes a PHOTO from his jacket, and hands it to Lilith.
0: 
N: Lilith looks at the photo. It's of a YOUNG GIRL, maybe 12.
N: Sweet and innocent-looking. But a hint of sadness too. She
N: plays around in the picture, seemingly from a happier time.

C:                          ATLAS
D:              Someone. My daughter, Allara. Taken
D:              hostage by a group of anarchists. I
D:              paid their absurd ransom and then--
D:              no contact. That was one year ago.

D:              Why me? You're Deukalian Atlas, you

0: 
C:                          ATLAS
D:              Six private armies. I sent my elite
D:              militia, the Crimson Lance, to find
D:              her. Even they've come up empty. Then
D:              it occurred to me that I was using a
D:              rather large hammer to solve a
D:              vicious rat problem, when what I
D:              needed was a vicious rat of my own.

N: Atlas pulls out an apple. Lilith looks at it like she hasn't
N: seen one in a long time. Maybe ever.

D:                  one? Didn't think so.

N:     CHOMP. He flips through her file again. We see images of
N:     Lilith's exploits. Demolished walls, bullet holes....

D:                  Never got caught-- until you broke

C:                              LILITH

C:                              ATLAS
D:                  You got further than anyone was ever
D:                  supposed to. Much, much further,
D:                  which, in turn, exposed security
D:                  flaws not even my best engineers were
D:                  aware of. Thus, earning you this
D:                  proposal: retrieve my daughter, and I
D:                  grant you your freedom.

N:     The door opens and Lilith steps out in her classic

D:              Chips can be removed. Your concern is

D:              facility on Phaeton anyway. In fact,
D:              I don't think you even knew what was
D:              in there.
E:                    (off Lilith)
D:              That's why you did it... You just
D:              heard there was something incredible
D:              in there, and you had to know what it
D:              was. You're not a thief at heart,
D:              Lilith. You're an explorer. A seeker
D:              of the hidden, compelled to find that
D:              which no one else has. And that is why
D:              I believe you will find my daughter.
D:              Now, your chariot awaits...

N:      Lilith talks with a few poor civilians, who live in the
N:      remains of old Dahl and Hyperion ships. She shows the photo,

N:      Lilith approaches the statue with trepidation: a Psycho
N:      warrior in a spiked steel battle suit, with a horned mask, a
N:      giant machete in hand. A terrifying vision, meant to warn
N:      anyone who enters these lands. Below it written ALL HAIL
N:      KROM. Suddenly, the statue bellows in a loud, crackled, pre-
N:      recorded voice:

N:      Lilith remembers something terrible. A voice comes into her

N:      Lilith realizes she's activating a speaker by standing on a
N:      small piece of metal. She takes her foot off. It stops.
0: 
N:      She hears some rustling noise and turns to the scrap pile.
N:      Someone, or something, is under there. She pulls her gun,
N:      ready, when a child, about 10, pops up with up a rusty
N:      weapon. A few other kids scramble out, admiring the find.

N:      Lilith stands in the cramped corridor in the rock. A small
N:      light at the end of the corridor. She takes a step, but her

0: 
N:      In the illustration, a winged half-bird/half-human hovers
N:      over the ground, in a protective bubble, shooting fire from

N:      presence, but keeps drawing, never turning around.

0: 
N:       Lilith walks through. Claptrap follows. She hasn't seen this
N:       place since she was Tina's age. Since her mother was alive.
N:       And now... it's a ruin. Like her.
0: 
N:       She stops at the entrance to a small room, then enters. Faded
N:       yellow and blue on the walls. Broken remnants of toys. Near
N:       the rotting wood of her old bed, there's a TEDDY BEAR. Lilith
N:       bends down to pick it up. It's a lot like the one Tina was
N:       carrying around. Odd, how close they are.
0: 
N:       And then something catches Lilith's eyes-- under the bed. She
N:       pulls it out. It's a SMALL TIN with a crude drawing on it. A
N:       drawing of a SHAPE. The same shape on Lilith's arm.
0: 
N:       She OPENS the tin. Inside... FOLDED PAPER. DRAWINGS. We saw
N:       these in Lilith's fuzzy memories when she first landed here.
0: 
N:       Lilith looks at the first one. A 5-year old's self-portrait
N:       in crayon. "LILITH." Then another one of her and her mother.
N:       They stand smiling under the Pandoran Sun/Moon.
0: 
N:       Lilith smiles at these forgotten glimpses of a childhood she
N:       can barely remember... Then she looks at the last drawing,
N:       and her blood runs cold. We do not see it. Just the shock on
N:       her face. And the dawning revelation of something enormous.
0: 
N:       In an instant, she understands everything. She knows why her
N:       mother stayed. She knows why she is the way she is. She knows
N:       that she has to find Tina as quickly as possible...
0: 
N:       She drops the picture and RUNS out. Claptrap hesitates,
N:       confused, then follows... As we hear the sound of their
N:       vehicle roar, we drift down to the edge of the drawing left
N:       there on the floor. The drawing we still cannot yet see...

N:       Back with Tina, Tannis, and Krieg. They move SLOWLY. It's
N:       deathly quiet here. On either side of them: DIORAMAS OF
N:       DEATH. Strange SCENES made of dead bodies, all pinned in
N:       place by spears or chunks of petrified trees. Don't freak
N:       out. It's more Pirates of the Caribbean scary than Saw scary.

N:       Lilith reaches out and takes the KEY from Tina. The first
N:       time she's held the assembled key... and she holds it high.
N:       Behold. THE GROOVES IN THE KEY begin to GLOW. Like purple
N:       fire in the stone. Lilith exhales. She wasn't sure that would
N:       work. But it did.

N:       And NOW the BATTLE FOR PANDORA begins.
0: 
N:       Rather than spell it all out beat by beat, let me give you
N:       the high points. Lilith can:
0: 
N:       PHASEWALK – instantaneous movement through another dimension,
N:       allowing her to traverse distances in the blink of an eye, or
N:       teleport someone else at will.
0: 
N:       Which means she's BEHIND the enemy, attacking them from the
N:       rear, and when they TURN to face her, she's not there... and
N:       now she's FLANKING THEM... and when they fire at her friends,
N:       she's instantly moving them through space as well...
0: 
N:       PHASELOCK – lock a Psycho in a bubble of energy, trapping
N:       them helplessly in mid-air... and then SLAM them down into
N:       their fellow Psychos, which is particularly fun when one of
N:       them is wearing something explosive like a flamethrower
N:       backpack or a cooking grenade...
0: 
N:       But when you're facing an army of a THOUSAND PSYCHOS, you
N:       need what we nerds like to call an "area of effect" attack.
N:       You know. Something that covers some space. Like:
0: 
N:       PHASESTRIKE – a concussive ENERGY BLAST that blows enemies
N:       backwards, smashing their bones and rendering them gooey.

D:              Whoa. That was weird. How could I
D:              have forgotten about that? It seems
D:              SO IMPORTANT. Would’ve been useful in
D:              the beginning, amirite?

E:                    (looks around)
D:              The thing is... well, you're less
D:              terrible than everyone else on this
D:              planet. I no longer wish death upon
D:              you. And what higher praise can I
D:              give than that?

C:                          LILITH
D:              A lot. A lot higher praise.

D:              there. And Skags and Rakk Hives. The

C:                          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
D:              No. But the Vault contained hope.
D:              Hope in the form of a flaming goddess
D:              who will lead us in the fight to save
D:              the good people of Pandora.

N: She nods. Yes. That is what she is. Hope. And... Wait. I'm

N: They sit, Tina, in between Lilith and Roland, Krieg on one
N: side, Steele the other.   Claptrap wheels over, and Krieg
N: pets him like a dog. Even Tannis comes by, pouring a cup of
N: tea for Tina. No idea where the fuck that came from.   And
N: Tina looks around...at her family. A tear in her eye.
