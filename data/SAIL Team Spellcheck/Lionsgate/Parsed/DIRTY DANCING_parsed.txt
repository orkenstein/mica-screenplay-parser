S: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - EVENING
N: CITY LIGHTS shine. The TWIN TOWERS stand tall. TRAFFIC jams the streets. The night’s hot. Steam rises. Sweat drips as PEOPLE jostle for space on crowded sidewalks. Cabbies shout at pedestrians. MUSIC mingles with CAR HORNS... SUPER: SUMMER, 1995
S: INT. SUBWAY STATION - SAME TIME
N: ...as BUSKERS lay down a boiling beat. The cadence echoes off the brick walls as a TRAIN pulls in, lending its squeaky clickety-clack sound to the underground tunes. Some TEENS dance to the pulse of the music, heated young bodies riding the rhythm. A few HOT GIRLS breeze through the platform. One drops a few bills into the busker’s basket. They head toward the train... ...and walk right past a YOUNG COUPLE leaning against a post. The guy whispers into his girlfriend’s ear. She grins, pulls his face to hers. As they make out...
S: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN
N: ...the TRAIN DOORS open. The Hot Girls hop on. Just before the doors close, the Make-Out-Couple dart inside. The Guy grabs an overhead strap, pulls his Girl close. Next to them: JAKE (19) grips a hand-strap. He’s broody. Scowly. Sexy as hell. He glances down at a SEALED LETTER in his other hand.
S: EXT. LONG ISLAND - MIDNIGHT - FLASHBACK
N: An expansive ELEGANT HOME is being remodeled. The yard is half-landscaped. A BACKHOE sits near a dirt mound. The area’s littered with BEER CANS, BOTTLES, and Jake’s FRIENDS. One climbs into the backhoe, says:
C: DRUNK FRIEND
D: Dude. The keys are in here.
N: The Backhoe’s engine RUMBLE to life. The BUCKET judders up and down. Jake laughs. Climbs onto the rig.
C: JAKE
D: Get out of there, idiot.
N: The Drunk Friend hops out. Jake slides into the seat. He yanks at the levers. His feet work the clutch and gas. A puff of DUST rises as the backhoe starts to move. His friends let out a raucous cheer. The backhoe bucket-teeth punch through the dirt. Jake shifts the lever and the bucket rises, dirt falling like snow.
C: JAKE
D: Where to?
E: CONT'D
N: A SEXY TEEN steps up to the backhoe. She smiles at Jake.
C: SEXY TEEN
D: The pool.
N: A pristine, crystal-blue swimming pool glitters in the moonlight. More cheers. Jake grins.
C: JAKE
D: The pool. You got it.
S: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - END FLASHBACK
N: The train STOPS. Make-Out-Girl stumbles, bumps into Jake. Whoops! Her Guy pulls her back to him. The doors OPEN. The Hot Girls eye him. Yummy. Jake grins. Not half bad. The train stops. The Hot Girls get off. One looks back at him. Smiles. Maybe he’ll go talk to her. But... the letter. The doors close. Oh, well. The train LURCHES forward.
S: EXT. LONG ISLAND ELEGANT HOME - FLASHBACK
N: BLUE LIGHTS strobe on top of a POLICE CRUISER. A few of the friends, the ones who didn’t run, loiter near the backhoe... ...which has been driven through the wall of the house. The cops approach, flashlights shining over the damage. Then the flashlights find Jake, sitting on a mound of dirt. Drinking a beer. Not a care in the world.
C: JAKE
D: Yo. Whaddup?
S: EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE, MANHATTAN - END FLASHBACK
N: Jake walks past THE LINCOLN CENTER. A group of DANCERS come out, still in rehearsal gear. They hurry down the stairs. He slows as the dancers dart around him, his eyes on a brightly-lit HIGHRISE up ahead. Imposing. Posh.
S: INT. POSH HIGHRISE - CORRIDOR
N: Jake checks the gilded door numbers. He looks at the envelope. Finally, he gets to: APT 1911. LAUGHTER inside. MUSIC. Jake straightens. KNOCKS. Waits. He’s about to knock again-- the door opens: a WOMAN (50s). Jake doesn’t know her. But we do. It’s LISA HOUSEMAN.
C: JAKE
D: I, uh, I’ve got this letter for...
N: He shows her the letter. She stares at it. Then at him.
C: LISA
D: What’s your name?
S: INT. BABY’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM
N: Lisa drags Jake into the room. It’s a SMALL PARTY, in full swing. Well-heeled guests laugh and mingle. Lisa hurries in, pulling Jake behind her.
C: LISA
D: You are not going to believe this.
N: A woman turns. It’s BABY (50s). Time has been good to her. She’s refined. Sleek. She eyes Jake. He looks familiar.
C: LISA
D: This is Jake Castle. Johnny’s son.
E: CONT'D
N: Baby’s face lights up. She hurries toward him.
C: BABY
D: I don’t believe it. Johnny’s son?
C: LISA
D: Spitting image, right? Jake, this is my sister, Frances Houseman.
N: Ah, okay. Jake holds up the letter.
C: JAKE
D: I have this for you. From my dad.
N: Baby takes the letter. Grins even wider. The guests are intrigued by this new bit of excitement. They all watch. LOLA (13), Baby’s daughter, joins her mom.
C: LOLA
D: Who’s Johnny Castle?
N: She starts to open the envelope.
C: BABY
D: Is he here? In the city?
N: She lifts the flap of the envelope and Jake realizes...
C: JAKE
D: You don’t know, do you?
N: Baby stops opening, looks up. Know what? Jake hesitates for a brief moment. Then:
C: JAKE
D: My dad died. Six years ago. It was cancer. I just found that letter and wanted to know who you were, and how you knew my dad.
E: CONT'D
C: BABY
D: I don’t-- wait, he... what? No. No.
N: DANIEL (50s), Lola’s dad, puts a hand on Baby’s back.
C: DANIEL
D: Francie--
N: Baby steps sharply away from him. Daniel looks to Lisa. Help?
C: LISA
D: Okay, everyone. Johnny... Castle.
N: Lisa takes center stage, keeping the attention off Baby.
C: LISA
D: Johnny was the love of Baby’s teenage life. It was the summer we spent at Kellerman’s, that place up in the Catskills...
E: CONT'D
N: Baby gives her a pleading look. Please don’t. So Lisa pivots.
C: LISA
D: Um, well, you all know me. I was nineteen and determined to find a husband.
E: CONT'D
C: GUEST
D: Just the one, Lisa?
N: Everyone laughs. Everyone except Jake and Baby. He hasn’t taken his eyes off Baby. She looks pretty broken up.
C: LISA
D: So I chased this waiter around all summer. Robbie. But he turned out to be a real asshole--
C: JAKE
D: What about my dad?
C: LOLA
D: Yeah. Tell us about Johnny.
N: Uhhh... Lisa looks to Baby. Baby forces a smile. Jake watches her closely. So does Daniel.
C: BABY
D: Johnny was...
N: She doesn’t cry, but she can’t speak, either.
C: LISA
D: Johnny was a dance instructor.
C: JAKE
D: A what? No. My dad was a house painter.
C: LISA
D: When we knew him, he was a dance instructor.
N: This is news to Jake. The fuck?
C: LOLA
D: You got it on with the dance instructor? Mom, that’s kinda hot.
E: whispers to Baby
N: Baby shakes her head. Trying to process... everything. Lisa still holds court -- but now she’s carried away. The guests hang on her every word:
C: LISA
D: He was so good. So was Baby. They were like magnets. You couldn’t keep them apart. Our parents found out and lost their minds. Johnny got fired. But he showed up to the summer showcase anyway. He grabbed Baby and they did this dance number that blew everyone away. Even Dad. Nobody puts Baby in a corner--
C: BABY
D: Yep. And that was the big finish.
N: She stands abruptly, a trembling smile pasted to her face. Daniel steps closer to her.
C: DANIEL
D: How did I not know any of this?
C: BABY
D: Because it was before you. Okay?
N: Okay. Daniel backs off. Baby goes to Jake.
C: BABY
D: I’m-- I didn’t know. I’m so sorry.
E: CONT'D
N: The tears threaten again. Jake looks around at the guests. The mood has gone from jovial to awkward.
C: JAKE
D: No, look, I shouldn’t have busted in on you like this.
S: INT. BABY’S APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR
N: Baby walks him to the door. She’s still spinning, but she’s got a better handle on it now. Just a little.
C: BABY
D: I’m... can I get your phone number? I’d like to talk more, but...
N: She glances back at the guests.
C: JAKE
D: Yeah, sure. I guess.
N: She watches as he walks toward the elevator. DING.
S: INT. BABY’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Baby offers goodnights to the guests as they file out. Lisa hugs her tightly.
C: LISA
D: Call me if you need me, okay? I don’t care what time it is.
E: whispers
N: Baby nods. Lisa starts to leave. Turns back. Gives Baby a long look, then kisses her cheek.
C: LISA
D: I love you.
E: CONT'D
N: She leaves. Closes the door behind her. Baby stares at the closed door. Turns. Daniel’s still there. She sighs.
C: DANIEL
D: You want to talk about it? I can stay, if you need some company.
C: BABY
D: No, Dan. I know we promised to stay friends--
C: DANIEL
D: We can still be more than that.
N: Lola joins them. Gives her dad a hip-bump.
C: LOLA
D: You wanna stay and hang out?
C: DANIEL
D: I don’t think so, hon. You know I how I feel about clean-up duty.
E: off Baby’s look
N: Lola laughs. Baby pushes him toward the door.
C: BABY
D: ‘Night, Daniel.
N: She closes the door. Lola’s dying to know:
C: LOLA
D: So what happened with you and Johnny? After the big showstopper?
C: BABY
D: Come on. We’ve got to be up early.
N: Lola grumbles and trods away, disappears into the hallway. Baby leans against the door. Shit.
S: EXT. DARK HIGHWAY - LATER
N: A BUS speeds down the road, the city lights far behind.
S: INT. BUS
N: Jake sits in the back. Alone.
S: INT. POLICE STATION - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT - FLASHBACK
N: Jake sits on a BENCH inside the police station. A couple his friends share looks of “what-the-fuck-ever” with him as they’re dragged out by their parents. A cop, PETE (50s), talks with MR. WINSTEAD (60s). Polished. Wealthy. Jake’s mom, ANNE (40s), hurries into the station. Tired. Overworked. She glares at Jake.
C: PETE
D: Anne, this is Mr. Winstead, he’s--
C: MR. WINSTEAD
D: --the owner of the property.
C: ANNE
D: Mr. Winstead. I’m so sorry about my son. Jake’s had a rough few years.
N: Pete puts a hand on Anne’s arm. Too familiar. Jake bristles.
C: PETE
D: You gotta get a handle on him.
E: quietly to Anne
C: JAKE
D: “He’s” right here.
N: Jake stands. Starts to walk past them but--
C: PETE
D: Son, wait--
C: JAKE
D: Don’t call me son.
N: Pete backs off. Winstead gives Jake a long, sympathetic look.
C: MR. WINSTEAD
D: I’ve had rough times, too, kid.
N: Jake’s face reddens. He seethes, humiliated.
C: MR. WINSTEAD
D: If you kids pay for the damages, we’ll forget this ever happened.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNE
D: They will. Thank you.
N: But Jake’s already at the door. She hurries to catch up.
C: ANNE
D: What would your dad think of you?
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: What would he think of you?
S: INT. BABY’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM
N: Baby looks through a PHOTO ALBUM, the unopened letter beside her. She flips through the album. Stops. Removes a photo. She stares at it. We don’t see the photo - just her face.
S: INT. BABY’S BEDROOM
N: Baby walks past a mirror and sees YOUNG BABY staring back. Then she’s gone. Baby looks down at the envelope. Opens it.
S: INT. JAKE’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM
N: Jake comes in. A POLICE UNIFORM SHIRT is draped over an ironing board. Another shirt hangs nearby.
S: INT. JAKE’S BEDROOM
N: Jake opens a nightstand drawer. Takes out a HOSPITAL WRISTBAND. He runs his thumb over the name: JOHN CASTLE.
S: EXT. BABY’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM BALCONY
N: Baby stares blindly out at the city, the open letter clenched in her hand. Whatever that letter said, it broke her.
S: EXT. CHELSEA PIERS INDOOR SPORTS COMPLEX - EARLY NEXT MORNING
N: A sprawling 28-acre indoor sports and entertainment complex on the Hudson River.
S: INT. SPORTS FIELD
N: A LACROSSE game. Lola’s on the field in her GREEN uniform and gear. She scoops the ball from the air.
S: INT. BLEACHERS
N: Baby sits with several other LACROSSE MOMS. They each wear an article of clothing in the same green as the girls’ uniforms. Baby’s in a green top. Fitting right in. But distracted. DIANE (50s) nudges her.
C: DIANE
D: Val tapped you for the charcuterie.
C: BABY
D: Oh. I can’t do brunch this weekend. I’m sorry. Something’s come up.
C: DIANE
D: Okay. Next Sunday, then.
C: LISA
D: Give ‘em hell, honey!
E: O.S.
N: Baby looks up as Lisa plops down beside her.
C: BABY
D: Hey. Thanks for taking her.
C: LISA
D: Oh, please. You know Lola’s practically my best friend. We’ll make it a girls’ weekend. Hair, nails, shows. Don’t act like I’m speaking a foreign language. What do you think these ladies do all weekend?
E: off Baby’s smirk
N: She jerks her head toward the Lacrosse Moms. Baby eyes them.
C: BABY
D: I don’t want to be like them.
C: LISA
D: You’re not like them.
N: Baby looks ruefully down at her green shirt. Yes, she is.
C: BABY
D: It felt like we were going to live forever, didn’t it?
C: LISA
D: You read the letter, huh?
E: gently
C: BABY
D: He wanted to see me one last time, before he-- and I didn’t--
C: LISA
D: Oh, God. Baby.
N: Baby shakes her head. Force-swallows. She can’t cry here. Lisa grabs her hand. Grips tightly. Baby pulls a photo from her purse. It’s the photo Baby took from the album: Johnny and Baby doing THE LIFT, 1963.
C: BABY
D: If I had seen him again... what would I have said? About myself? What I’m doing now?
N: Baby stares at her young, idealistic self in the photo.
C: BABY
D: That girl would not be sitting here, letting herself be drafted to bring a meat tray to Sunday brunch. I thought I was going to change the world. Instead, I ended up just like Johnny said I would. A society housewife...
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: Soon-to-be-ex-housewife.
C: BABY
D: ...and I can’t even blame it on Dan. It was my choice. I gave up my career for him. For my family.
E: MORE
C: BABY
D: I love Lola more than anything, but... I’m not me anymore. And I’m not going to live forever.
E: CONT'D beat
N: Lisa grabs the photo from Baby. Holds it up to Baby’s face.
C: LISA
D: See this girl? You are still everything you always were.
N: Lisa scoots closer. Puts an arm around her.
C: LISA
D: I’m so glad you’re doing this. Now you’d better get on the road.
E: CONT'D
N: Baby stands, finds Lola on the field. Gives her a wave and blows her a kiss. Lola waves back. Baby kisses Lisa. Leaves. Lisa turns to smile at Diane.
C: LISA
D: Meat trays, huh? Are they kosher?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. JAKE’S BEDROOM - MID MORNING
N: Jake zips a DUFFLE BAG. He grabs his WALLET and KEYS.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
N: Anne’s waiting when Jake comes in, bag over his shoulder.
C: ANNE
D: Where were you last night?
C: JAKE
D: I see Officer Pete slept over. Thanks for keeping it down.
C: ANNE
D: It’s been six years, Jake. This thing with Pete, it doesn’t mean I don’t still love your father--
E: beat
N: He opens the front door.
C: ANNE
D: Where are you going now?
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: None of your business.
C: ANNE
D: It very much is my business.
N: That stops him. He turns.
C: JAKE
D: Who is Frances Houseman? I found the letter Dad wrote to her. The one you never sent.
N: Anne falters. Last thing she expected him to say.
C: JAKE
D: You want to know where I was last night? I was with Frances. I gave her the letter.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNE
D: No. You didn’t.
N: He stares her down. Yes. He did.
C: ANNE
D: How dare you go behind my back--
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: It was hers!
C: ANNE
D: Everything was hers! His hopes, his dreams. But she let him go and I... No, I didn’t mail the letter. I couldn’t let her have his pain, too. That, at least, was mine.
E: fights sudden tears
N: Pete walks in. Looks like he just woke up.
C: PETE
D: Hey. Everything okay?
C: JAKE
D: Just headed out for a few days. Make yourself at home, Officer.
N: Through the open door, Anne sees a SILVER MERCERDES pull up.
C: ANNE
D: Who is that?
S: EXT. JAKE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Jake walks out, Anne right behind him. She freezes as the car door opens and Baby steps out. Anne stares. Baby stares back.
C: JAKE
D: I’m going to Kellerman’s with Frances. Turns out, Dad used to be a dancer. Who knew?
C: ANNE
D: Jake, wait--
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER
N: Baby’s car speeds along.
S: INT. BABY’S CAR
C: BABY
D: Your mom seemed upset. I hope she’s okay with this trip.
C: JAKE
D: She’s just doing her usual pissed-at-me thing.
C: BABY
D: What is she, uh, pissed about? If you don’t mind my asking.
N: For a moment, she thinks he’s not going to answer. Then:
C: JAKE
D: I was hanging out at a building site with some friends and I accidentally drove a backhoe through a wall. Now she wants me to come up with three thousand dollars to pay for “my part” of the damages.
E: shrugs
C: BABY
D: I’m guessing you weren’t supposed to be there.
C: JAKE
D: Hey, it’s not my fault. The gate was open. Keys were in the backhoe.
E: laughs now
N: Baby glances at him. Jake gives zero fucks about what he did.
C: JAKE
D: So you and my dad, huh? Just a summer fling?
E: CONT'D
N: Jake gives her a long once over. She’s high-class. Luxury car, the CAR PHONE mounted on the console. Rich.
C: BABY
D: No. We tried. We were-- it was hard to stay connected.
C: JAKE
D: Mom said you let him go.
C: BABY
D: We just had different... lives.
C: JAKE
D: Yeah. You have a phone in your car.
C: BABY
D: That wasn’t the only difference.
E: beat
N: They go quiet. It’s kind of awkward.
C: BABY
D: So. What about you? College?
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: Some Army base, I guess. It’s the best option for someone like me.
C: BABY
D: Someone like you?
C: JAKE
D: You know.
C: BABY
D: There’s nothing you want? No dreams? No goals?
C: JAKE
D: I don’t do goals. I do easy.
N: She doesn’t like the sound of that. But she lets it go.
S: EXT. SAUGERTIES, NY - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Baby’s car drives through a small, idyllic town. They pass a ROAD SIGN: SAUGERTIES, NY.
C: JAKE
D: Where the hell are we?
S: EXT. WINDING ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
N: Baby’s car winds up the road to Kellerman’s. In the distance, the resort sprawls over the serene countryside.
S: INT. BABY’S CAR
N: Baby’s eyes catch the sign: KELLERMAN’S... and faintly, WE HEAR the opening beats of BE MY BABY. Like a memory. Like a heartbeat. Then it’s gone. Baby pulls the car over. Gets out.
S: EXT. ROAD ABOVE KELLERMAN’S
N: From this vantage, Baby can see all of Kellerman’s: HOTEL, GROUNDS, GAZEBOS, DOCKS, LAKE. Jake steps up beside her.
C: JAKE
D: Damn. That’s Kellerman’s?
N: Baby stares down at the resort. At her past.
S: INT. KELLERMAN’S RESORT - MAIN LOBBY - MINUTES LATER
N: BRIDESMAIDS rush through the lobby toward an open BALLROOM. They line up beside a handful of GROOMSMEN. Jake looks around. Okay, he’s impressed. Baby comes over.
C: JAKE
D: Did it always look like this?
C: BABY
D: Pretty much. Minus the bridesmaids.
N: She hands Jake a ROOM KEY. Glances around. It’s exactly the same. Everything. Almost as if she walked back in time.
S: EXT. KELLERMAN’S - MOMENTS LATER
N: A CONSTRUCTION CREW works on several new outdoor areas. A huge new gazebo has begun to take shape on the lake. Jake stands on the veranda, watches the action. He spots: CAMILA (19). An exotic beauty. Walking right toward him. She trots up the stairs. He puts on his sexiest bad-boy grin:
C: JAKE
D: Hey. Hi--
N: She looks at him. He’s hot. But she immediately shuts it down. Smiles politely, but not warmly.
C: CAMILA
D: Group lessons will be at the pavilion at five. Excuse me.
N: She joins CARLOS (17) at the front lobby doors. Carlos grins at Jake. Camila takes his hand. Baby steps up beside Jake. Her eyes roam the grounds.
C: BABY
D: Beautiful, isn’t it?
N: He’s still looking at Camila. She and Carlos go inside.
C: JAKE
D: Sure is. See you later.
N: He heads inside. Baby watches him go. Um, okay. She turns to look at the lake. She’s really back.
S: EXT. NATURE PATH - MOMENTS LATER
N: Baby walks. Deep in thought. Finds herself at:
S: INT. OLD GAZEBO - CONTINUOUS
N: Baby stands on the exact spot where she confronted her father so many years ago. You let me down, too. She reverently touches the railing.
S: INT. MAIN RESORT, BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Music drifts out. Camila and Carlos are dancing together. Jake doesn’t recognize the dance, but they’re really good. Camila stops. Gives Carlos a correction. They dance again. Jake leans against the doorframe, watching them. Wow. He stares at Camila. Not hiding his interest. Carlos whispers:
C: CARLOS
D: Ooooh, my. You have an admirer.
N: Camila glances at Jake. He smiles at her. She ignores him.
C: CARLOS
D: He’s awfully cute. More than cute. He’s hot. Maybe he’s looking at me? Hey, it could happen.
E: CONT'D no response from Camila still no response that gets a chuckle
N: He spins Camila out to face Jake. He is insanely hot. She stops dancing. Goes to the door.
C: CAMILA
D: Sorry. This is a closed rehearsal.
N: She closes the door in his face.
C: CARLOS
D: So hot you had to kick him out?
C: CAMILA
D: Shut up.
S: EXT. LITTLE BRIDGE
C: JOHNNY
D: You’re not scared of anything...
E: V.O.
N: Baby steps onto the bridge, looks out at the water. At Kellerman’s, on the hill. Her eyes go distant, remembering:
C: YOUNG BABY
D: Me?! I’m scared of everything...
E: V.O.
N: She crosses the little bridge until she gets to:
S: EXT. STONE STEPS
N: They’re exactly as she left them. She touches a handrail.
C: YOUNG BABY
D: What I saw. What I did. Who I am...
E: V.O.
N: She takes a moment, lets the memories wash over her...
S: EXT. OLD STAFF CABINS
N: ...as she stops in front of the STAFF CABINS. She looks across to JOHNNY’S CABIN. Old. Weathered. But still standing. She stares as the door opens and a YOUNG BABY walks down the steps, followed by a shirtless Johnny.
C: YOUNG BABY
D: And most of all...
E: V.O.
N: Baby walks toward the memory...
S: EXT. JOHNNY’S OLD CABIN
N: Baby opens the door... and walks inside.
S: INT. JOHNNY'S OLD CABIN
N: The cabin’s been vacant awhile. Basic furniture: Bed. Chair. Steamer trunk. Standing mirror. Baby takes it all in. She touches the chair. Hesitantly sits.
C: YOUNG BABY
D: ...I’m scared of walking out of this room and never feeling again, in my whole life, the way I feel when I’m with you.
E: V.O.
N: She stares into the mirror. Looking for Young Baby. But only Frances stares back.
S: EXT. MAIN RESORT - LATER
N: Camila and Carlos step out as a 1955 PORSCHE 550 SPYDER roars up the driveway. Carlos gawks.
C: CARLOS
D: Dios mio. Do you see that?
N: The car stops right in front of them. MR. STANTON (50s) gets out. He has that old-money arrogance about him. Sees Carlos:
C: STANTON
D: Appreciate it.
N: He tosses Carlos his CAR KEYS. Carlos grins. Sweet!
C: CAMILA
D: He’s not the valet.
C: CARLOS
D: Oh, it’s no trouble. I can park it.
C: CAMILA
D: No. I’m sorry about the confusion.
N: She gives Mr. Stanton his keys. The VALET, a young Latino man, hurries up to the car.
C: VALET
D: Good evening, sir.
N: Mr. Stanton gives him the keys without a second glance.
S: EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION - EARLY EVENING
N: Guests gather for the group dance class. Some have already paired off and are dancing to the upbeat music.
S: EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION, AT RAILING
N: Baby and Jake stand at the railing. Jake checks his watch. Not quite 5:00. No Camila yet.
C: BABY
D: I used to be pretty good at this. Come on, dance with me.
N: Jake hesitates. Baby pulls him onto the dance area.
S: EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION, DANCE AREA
N: Baby pulls Jake’s arms up. Nudges his elbows.
C: BABY
D: Look at that. Spaghetti arms.
N: She makes a circle with his arms and steps into them. They dance. Jake’s not bad.
C: BABY
D: See? You’re a natural.
E: CONT'D
N: Baby’s having a great time. Jake smiles, too. NOAH (27), handsome and charming, taps Jake’s shoulder.
C: NOAH
D: Mind if I cut in?
N: Jake looks to Baby.
C: BABY
D: Um, sure.
N: Jake hands her over to Noah. Heads off the dance floor. Noah pulls Baby into his arms.
C: NOAH
D: I could tell as soon as you stepped onto the floor, you knew what you were doing. Your form. It’s lovely.
C: BABY
D: Well, it’s been a really long time.
C: NOAH
D: It’ll come back to you. Lemme help.
N: He pulls her closer. He’s an experienced dancer. Skilled. Baby moves with him. Okay, she’s got this.
S: EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION, AT RAILING
N: Jake watches Baby dance with Noah. A handful of BEAUTIFUL GIRLS sidle up beside him.
C: BEAUTIFUL GIRL
D: Do you have a partner yet?
N: Jake gives the girls a rakish grin.
C: JAKE
D: Yeah. I’m waiting for her.
N: They all pout. Then Camila and Carlos arrive.
S: EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION, ON DANCEFLOOR
N: Baby’s dance with Noah has taken on some heat. Noah pulls her even closer. Baby misses a step. Laughs at herself.
C: BABY
D: I was better when I was younger.
C: NOAH
D: You’re perfect now.
N: Baby falters. Suddenly awkward. Unsure. Is he flirting?
C: BABY
D: You know what? I think I’m going to, um, get a drink. I’ll see ya.
N: Noah lets her go, a bit reluctantly.
S: EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION, AT RAILING
N: Jake can’t take his eyes off Camila. Carlos walks up to him:
C: CARLOS
D: Hola, cabron. Keep your eyes where they belong, eh?
C: JAKE
D: She your girlfriend or something?
N: Carlos stares Jake down. Or he tries to. Jake stares back.
C: CARLOS
D: She’s my sister. Camila. I’m Carlos.
E: caves with a chuckle
C: CAMILA
D: Okay! Everyone find a partner.
E: O.S.
N: Jake grins. Pushes off the railing. Heads toward Camila.
C: CARLOS
D: Oh, man. She is gonna hate you.
S: EXT. LAKESIDE PAVILION, ON DANCEFLOOR - CONTINUOUS
N: Jake stops in front of Camila. Holds out his hand. Music starts. A long beat, then she cooly steps into his arms.
C: JAKE
D: Right on time. I’m Jake.
C: CAMILA
D: Welcome to Kellerman’s, Jake.
C: JAKE
D: Thank you, Camila.
N: She fits perfectly in his arms. She feels it. Too much. She pulls away, keeping space between their bodies.
C: CAMILA
D: You sure you don’t want to dance with one of your friends?
N: The Beautiful Girls sneer at her from the railing.
C: JAKE
D: They’re not my friends.
N: She doesn’t believe him. She leads him into a turn.
C: JAKE
D: I’d like for you to be my friend.
E: CONT'D
C: CAMILA
D: I don’t fraternize with the guests.
C: JAKE
D: Well, I’m not really a--
C: BABY
D: Jake!
E: O.S.
N: Baby makes her way through the crowded pavilion. She has two drinks. Camila smiles at Jake. Walks away. Jake stares after her. Then he looks to Carlos, who’s laughing.
S: INT. MAIN RESORT, DINING ROOM - THAT EVENING
N: The layout and decor haven’t changed since 1963. Jake watches a WAITER deliver a pasta dish to a table nearby.
C: JAKE
D: I should have ordered that.
N: Baby follows his gaze. Looks past the table to the BAR AREA. Noah watches her. He smiles. Raises his drink. Baby pulls her eyes away. She looks at Jake. So familiar.
C: BABY
D: You’re so much like him, you know.
C: JAKE
D: I’ve heard.
C: BABY
D: What was your relationship like? With Johnny? Were you close?
C: JAKE
D: I thought we were. But I guess not. He never told me he spent his summers in a lush place like this, dancing. Must’ve been nice.
C: BABY
D: It wasn’t paradise for him, trust me. He just wanted to dance, but--
C: JAKE
D: Whatever.
C: BABY
D: Why did you come with me? If not to hear about Johnny?
E: beat
C: JAKE
D: To get away from my mom.
C: BABY
D: I don’t believe you.
N: She studies him. Looking so deeply that he has to look away.
C: BABY
D: You brought a six year old letter to the middle of Manhattan, to find out who I was to your dad. But you don’t care. Right. I’ve known guys like you. I knew one guy who was just like you.
E: CONT'D off his brooding scowl
N: Jake looks up. Does she mean...? She nods.
C: BABY
D: I’m going to show you around tomorrow. So, no disappearing act.
E: CONT'D
N: Jake shrugs. Her eyes hold his until... The waiter arrives at their table with a DRINK for Baby.
C: WAITER
D: From the gentleman at the bar.
N: Baby’s eyes shoot to Noah.
C: JAKE
D: Yeah, I’m out.
N: He stands. Starts to walk away.
C: BABY
D: Jake.
C: JAKE
D: You win, Frances. Tomorrow.
E: long beat
N: He leaves. Baby sees Noah stand. He smiles and heads her way. But Baby gets up. Walks out.
S: EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Jake follows the sound of MUSIC to a LARGE CLEARING on the far side of the lake. The area is lit by STRING LIGHTS and LANTERNS, crowded with people laughing and dancing. In the distance, a LIGHTHOUSE BEACON shines over the water.
S: EXT. LAKESIDE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS
N: Jake makes his way through the crowd. All young people who work there: WAITSTAFF. CATERING. HOUSEKEEPING. Everyone’s dancing. It’s hot. Humid. Sticky bodies entwined. Camila and Carlos are dancing the Mambo as if they created it. A perfect unit. Carlos sees Jake. So does Camila.
C: CARLOS
D: Lookie lookie.
C: CAMILA
D: He’s a hotel guest. He’s not supposed to be down here.
C: CARLOS
D: Why don’t you just talk to him?
C: CAMILA
D: No distractions. Not now.
C: CARLOS
D: But he’s just standing there. Looking so... him.
C: CAMILA
D: You want me to talk to him? Fine.
N: She STOPS dancing. Carlos sighs. A few other couples stop dancing to see what’s up. Camila makes sure they’re watching before she walks up to Jake:
C: CAMILA
D: What do you want?
E: CONT'D
N: Wow. She’s even more beautiful tonight. Her scowl. Her flashing eyes. He smiles, and steps close to her. Very close.
C: JAKE
D: Pretty sure I already got it.
C: CAMILA
D: Yeah? What’s that?
C: JAKE
D: Your attention.
N: Somebody WHOOPS. A catcall. Camila’s face FLAMES.
S: EXT. NATURE PATH - MOMENTS LATER
N: Camila hurries home. Furious. Carlos follows her, laughing.
C: CARLOS
D: Slow down. I can’t keep up.
C: CAMILA
D: Die out here, then.
C: CARLOS
D: Come on. That was amazing.
C: CAMILA
D: What? My humiliation?
C: CARLOS
D: He didn’t humiliate you. You tried to humiliate him and he wouldn’t let you. Now you’re mad about it. And that’s really funny.
E: starts to laugh again
S: INT. NEW GAZEBO - SAME TIME
N: Moonlight shines through the naked roof beams. Baby stands at the railing. Music drifts to her. Laughter. She leans out. Sees the string-lights and dancing at the lakeside clearing. Kids having fun. She looks over the water. A soft breeze picks up. She closes her eyes, as if waiting for... Nothing happens. She opens her eyes. Turns to leave.
S: INT. JAKE’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Jake lies in bed. Johnny’s hospital wristband in his hand. He stares at it.
S: INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME
N: It’s a SMALL SUITE, with a tiny living area, separate bedroom and separate bath.
S: INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM, LIVING ROOM AREA
N: Baby’s in a chair by the window. Johnny’s letter in her hand.
S: EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS, VARIOUS LOCATIONS - LATE NIGHT
N: Quiet. Peaceful. The front lawn shines in the moonlight. String-lights twinkle over empty pavilions. The LIGHTHOUSE BEACON makes a sweeping journey over the rippling water, the silent staff-party area, then it’s gone.
S: EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - EARLY NEXT MORNING
N: Summer sun shines on the resort. Guests breakfast on an outdoor patio, paddle canoes on the water, play lawn games. The construction crew unload LUMBER from a truck, prepping for their workday. A few 2 x 12s clatter to the ground.
S: INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME
N: The envelope lies on the floor, Johnny’s handwriting lit by the morning sun shining in the window. A half-empty glass of wine sits on a side table, the open bottle next to it. And still in the chair, letter in her hand: Baby. Asleep. She wakes to the loud BANG of the dropped lumber. She sits up.
S: INT. MAIN RESORT LOBBY - SAME TIME
N: Jake walks toward the front doors--
C: CONCIERGE
D: Excuse me. Mr. Castle?
E: O.S.
N: Jake turns. The Concierge holds up a stack of message slips.
S: EXT. NEW GAZEBO - MOMENTS LATER
N: A CREW is building a HUGE GAZEBO. Jake steps over a half-laid BRICK PATH, flips through the messages. All from Anne:
C: CALL ME. WINSTEAD IS CALLING.
D: URGENT! CALL ME NOW.
N: PAUL, the Foreman, walks to greet Jake:
C: PAUL
D: Morning. Were we too loud?
N: Jake shakes his head, then nods to the framed-out gazebo.
C: JAKE
D: What’s it for?
C: PAUL
D: Big society wedding. We’re sprucing the whole place up, top to toe. Killing ourselves to get it all done in time, if we even can.
N: Jake sees Camila and Carlos run toward the Main Resort. Carlos waves. Camila snatches his hand from the air. Jake laughs, looks down at the messages. A sudden thought:
C: JAKE
D: Sounds like you could use an extra pair of hands. My dad was a house painter, so I practically grew up on construction sites. You hiring?
S: INT. MAIN RESORT, LOBBY
N: Neil gives Camila a thick MANILA PACKET.
C: NEIL
D: The Silvermans. You know the name.
N: Camila opens the packet. Pulls out PHOTOS: ISABEL and ARIEL.
C: NEIL
D: Isabel and her lovely daughter Ariel. These are our big fish. Make them happy, you have jobs for life.
E: CONT'D
N: He leaves.
C: CAMILA
D: Jobs for life. Shoot me now.
C: CARLOS
D: Speak for yourself. Not all of us have dreams of fancy dance schools.
N: She reads the Silverman’s PREFERENCE SHEET. Sighs.
C: CAMILA
D: Why do they always want the Mambo? They can’t ever do it right.
S: EXT. MAIN RESORT, VERANDA
N: Baby drinks a cup of coffee. Jake trots up the steps.
C: JAKE
D: How was your big night? With Mr. Dancy-pants, buy-a-girl-a- drink? I think he likes you.
E: off Baby’s huh? look
C: BABY
D: Good morning to you.
N: Jake’s quiet for a moment. Then:
C: JAKE
D: Look, I do want to be here, okay?
N: That’s the closest to an apology she’s going to get.
C: JAKE
D: And I got a job.
E: CONT'D
C: BABY
D: What? Here?
C: JAKE
D: On the construction crew. I gotta pay that money back.
C: BABY
D: And it has nothing to do with a certain dance instructor? Can’t blame you. I know how that can be--
C: NEIL
D: Somebody pinch me, I must be dreaming. Is that Baby Houseman?
E: O.S.
N: She pastes on a friendly smile. Turns.
C: BABY
D: Neil Kellerman. Look at you.
C: NEIL
D: Baby. How have you been?
C: BABY
D: I’m not really “Baby” anymore.
C: NEIL
D: Oh. Of course. Frances. What’s got you up here? Old times’ sake?
C: BABY
D: Neil, this is Jake Castle. Johnny’s son. You remember Johnny?
C: NEIL
D: Everyone remembers Johnny.
N: It’s clear Neil’s memories are NOT fond. He looks Jake over.
C: NEIL
D: I guess Baby, er, Frances told you your dad was one of the most “sought after” instructors here? Never had any trouble finding partners, that’s for sure.
E: CONT'D
N: That sounds a lot like a put-down. Jake looks to Baby.
C: BABY
D: Johnny’s been dead six years, Neil.
C: NEIL
D: Oh. I didn’t-- I-- damn. Sorry, kid. I was just-- damn, I--
S: EXT. LITTLE BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jake follows Baby across the bridge, toward the stone steps.
C: JAKE
D: What did he mean? About my dad?
N: She trots up the stone steps. Jake follows.
S: EXT. JOHNNY’S OLD CABIN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jake glances at it. Catches up with her.
C: JAKE
D: You said something, too. About it not being good for him here.
N: Baby looks up at the cabin, then sits on a step.
C: BABY
D: This was his cabin. Every summer he was here, this is where he stayed.
N: That stops Jake. A quick, intense reverence washes over him.
C: BABY
D: Come here.
E: CONT'D
N: He sits beside her. A tiny crack in his tough guy act.
C: BABY
D: Your dad was beautiful. And the women here, they were older, wealthy. They could buy anything they wanted. And they did.
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: Wait-- you said he was a dance instructor.
C: BABY
D: He was. But those women, one complaint could cost him his job. So Johnny made sure they didn’t have a reason to complain.
N: That’s heavy news for Jake. He eyes Baby.
C: JAKE
D: Did you... buy him, too?
C: BABY
D: No. What we had was real. So real.
N: A few bars of CRY TO ME drift around her. She gives the memory the barest moment, then shakes it off.
C: BABY
D: You want to go inside?
E: CONT'D
N: Jake looks at the cabin, the new information about his dad spinning through his mind. He shakes his head. No.
C: JAKE
D: Maybe that’s why he never told me about dancing. And Kellerman’s.
C: BABY
D: Maybe. Come on. I want to show you the rehearsal cabin. That’s where we spent most of our time.
E: she stands
N: Jake gives her a look. She laughs.
C: BABY
D: Dancing. Most of our time dancing.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. UPSTAIRS REHEARSAL CABIN
N: It’s now used for storage: WIGS. COSTUME RACKS. PROPS. RECORD PLAYERS. AN OLD VIDEO PROJECTOR. Stacks and stacks of BOXES.
C: BABY
D: Who put all this shit in here?
E: frustrated
C: JAKE
D: You okay?
C: BABY
D: You don’t understand. This is where your dad danced. Where he taught people to come alive. It’s where I-- Now it’s just a room full of junk.
N: She shoves a stack of boxes. One falls. 8MM VIDEO REELS roll onto the floor. Jake picks one up one of the reels. She sees an open box. VINYL ALBUMS. On the top: “Love Is Strange” and Other Bests by Mickey & Sylvia. A long beat. Then Baby reverently picks it up.
C: BABY
D: He loved dancing. I wish you could have seen him, the way he moved.
E: CONT'D
N: Jake doesn’t say it, but so does he. She puts the album back in the box. Closes the lid. Jake watches her. She really loved him.
S: EXT. OUTSIDE EATING AREA - AFTERNOON
N: Baby and Jake finish their lunch.
C: JAKE
D: Can I ask you something? It’s kind of a favor. I’m gonna be spending the rest of the summer here, so I was wondering if you’d ask Neil if I could bunk in one of the, um, older cabins.
C: BABY
D: One of the old-- you mean... Johnny’s cabin?
N: Jake shrugs, tries not to look too hopeful.
C: BABY
D: I think that’s a great idea, Jake. I’ll talk to Neil.
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: Sweet. I’ll go pack.
N: He gets up, leaves. Baby watches him go. So much like Johnny.
C: NOAH
D: Was it the dance? Or the drink?
E: O.S.
N: She looks up at him. He sits down across from her, pulls out a small notepad and a pen. Ready to take notes.
C: NOAH
D: Really, I want to know. I gotta get these things right. Can’t go around offending beautiful women.
E: CONT'D
N: He waits. And waits. Finally, she smiles:
C: BABY
D: First... ...introduce yourself.
E: off his expectant nod
C: NOAH
D: See? I knew there was something.
N: She laughs. Looks him over. Adorable.
S: EXT. JOHNNY’S CABIN - EARLY EVENING
N: Jake hurries up the steps, his duffel bag over his shoulder. He puts his hand on the screen door handle. Pulls...
S: INT. JOHNNY'S / JAKE’S CABIN - CONTINUOUS
N: ...and takes a reverent step inside. He stands still, as if trying to feel his dad’s presence. He doesn’t. He laughs at himself. Stupid. He drops his bag on the bed. Looks up at a quiet KNOCK on the screen door. It’s Carlos.
C: CARLOS
D: Heard you’re on the crew now. Oof, this cabin, though... what’d you do to piss off old man Kellerman?
C: JAKE
D: It was my dad’s cabin. He used to work here. As the dance instructor.
C: CARLOS
D: No shit. When?
C: JAKE
D: Million years ago.
S: EXT. NEW GAZEBO, ROOF - SUNDOWN
N: Jake and Carlos sit in the half-built rafters, legs dangling.
C: JAKE
D: Now she’s screwing this cop. Pete. He was Dad’s friend. And I’m like, does it have to be someone he knew?
C: CARLOS
D: Yeah. Screw a stranger, lady.
C: JAKE
D: Exactly! So. How can I get your sister to talk to me?
E: beat
C: CARLOS
D: Dude. That was the worst segue.
C: JAKE
D: It was. My bad.
C: CARLOS
D: You can’t. She’s focused on this scholarship audition she’s got for Tisch, the dance school at NYU. All she does is work and rehearse.
C: JAKE
D: Doesn’t leave much room for fun.
C: CARLOS
D: You’re telling me. I’m her partner.
N: Jake stands up, inches his way toward the edge of a beam.
C: CARLOS
D: Whoa. What are you doing?
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: Getting down.
C: CARLOS
D: Jake. Waitaminute--
N: But Jake’s already pulling off his shirt. He launches himself off and back-flips into the water. He comes up, shakes the hair from his face. Carlos stares down at him.
C: JAKE
D: Come on!
C: CARLOS
D: I can’t get hurt. Camila needs me--
C: JAKE
D: It’s water, Carlos. Jump.
N: Carlos gingerly gets to his feet. Takes off his shirt. Then... he JUMPS. Splashes into the water beside Jake.
S: EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS
N: Jake and Carlos walk across the lawn. The Spyder roars up, idles in front of the Main Resort. Carlos’s eyes go dreamy.
C: CARLOS
D: James Dean had a Porsche Spyder. I saw him in Rebel Without a Cause and that’s when I knew.
C: JAKE
D: That you wanted a Porsche?
C: CARLOS That I wanted--
D: A Porsche. Like James Dean... had.
E: catches himself
N: Carlos pales. Jake lets him play it off. Mr. Stanton gets out of the car. Sees Carlos... and tosses him the keys.
C: STANTON
D: Take it easy with her.
N: Carlos stares down at the keys. Mr. Stanton is already walking inside. Carlos starts to say something, but:
C: JAKE
D: Come on. Quick spin.
N: Jake gets in the passenger side. Waits for Carlos.
C: CARLOS
D: No way. You’re nuts.
C: JAKE
D: What would James Dean do?
N: Jake grins. Carlos looks around. Fuck it. He hops in.
S: INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM
N: She stands in front of the mirror. She looks amazing. Outfit. Hair. Makeup. All perfection. She grabs her room key.
S: INT. MAIN RESORT, DINING ROOM BAR - MOMENTS LATER
N: Noah looks up as she comes in. Beautiful. He’s about to tell her so when she says:
C: BABY
D: This is not a date. Just dinner.
C: NOAH
D: And maybe a dance?
N: As they’re walking to their table:
C: BABY
D: That was a great pivot today.
C: NOAH
D: Don’t know what you mean.
C: BABY
D: Yes, you do. I was an attorney for years. I admire a good change of tactic. Could have been a bit smoother, though.
C: NOAH
D: Let me get out my notepad.
S: EXT. WINDING ROAD
N: The Spyder speeds along the curves. Top down. Music blaring.
C: CARLOS
D: Whoooooooo hooooo!
N: Carlos takes a curve. Grips the wheel. Excited and nervous.
C: CARLOS
D: We’re gonna be in so much trouble.
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: Nah. My friend’s a valet. We do this all the time.
S: INT. MAIN RESORT, DINING ROOM
N: Baby and Noah linger over dessert. They’re laughing.
C: NOAH
D: Just like that? Problem solved?
C: BABY
D: Uh, no. We were weeks in court. But yeah, eventually, problem solved.
N: Noah goes to pour more wine. Baby covers her glass.
C: NOAH
D: Sounds like you were an amazing attorney. And now? What do you do?
C: BABY
D: I’m not sure anymore. God. I need to stop talking.
E: beat
C: NOAH
D: Okay. Dancing then.
C: BABY
D: I think we already know how that’s going to go.
N: He stands. Offers his hand.
C: NOAH
D: Life’s all about second chances.
S: INT. MAIN RESORT, DINING ROOM, DANCE FLOOR
N: It’s a bluesy slow song. Baby steps into his arms. Already feeling the nerves.
C: NOAH
D: Trust yourself.
N: Baby scoffs self-consciously.
C: NOAH
D: Trust me, then.
E: CONT'D
C: BABY
D: Listen, please don’t get the wrong idea, Noah. I’m not...
E: long beat
C: NOAH
D: I just want one good dance.
N: He pulls her close. Starts to move.
S: EXT. WINDING ROAD
N: The Porsche is half on the road, half in a shallow ditch. The boys are behind the car, hands on the bumper. Jake laughs.
C: CARLOS
D: We’re screwed.
E: terrified
C: JAKE
D: It’s fine. We didn’t hurt it. We’ll get it on the road and back to Kellerman’s. Ready? One, two--
N: Carlos pushes too early. Too hard. His foot slips. He yelps.
C: JAKE
D: You’re supposed to wait for three.
E: CONT'D
N: Carlos grabs his ankle.
C: CARLOS
D: I twisted it. Ow, shit.
N: He tries to stand up. Ow. Ow ow ow.
C: CARLOS
D: Cami’s gonna kill me.
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: Come on, you’re okay--
N: A CAR stops on the road. A POLICE CRUISER. The doors open.
C: JAKE
D: Hey. Heads up.
E: CONT'D
N: Jake hefts Carlos to his feet. Carlos stares at the cops.
C: JAKE
D: Just be cool. We’re fine.
E: CONT'D
N: The cops study Carlos... the car... Carlos. Jake flashes an easy, carefree grin. This is familiar territory for him.
C: JAKE
D: Hey, guys, thanks for stopping, but we’re all good here. Tires got a little slick, that’s all.
E: CONT'D
C: COP
D: License and registration.
E: to Carlos
N: Carlos looks to Jake.
C: COP
D: Don’t look at him. Look at me. License and registration. Now.
E: CONT'D
C: CARLOS
D: Sir-- I don’t have--
C: COP
D: You got a green card? Anything?
C: CARLOS
D: I... was born here. Sir.
C: COP
D: This your car?
C: CARLOS
D: No-- no, sir, but--
C: JAKE
D: This is a simple misunderstanding, Officers. The car belongs to a friend of mine and we were just returning it. We don’t need to take up any more of your night.
N: The cops ignore Jake. They’re focused solely on Carlos.
C: COP
D: Is. This. Your. Car?
E: to Carlos
S: INT. MAIN RESORT CORRIDOR - LATER
N: Baby lets herself into her room.
S: INT. BABY'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

S: INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
N: Baby opens and closes drawers. All empty. She zips her suitcase-- RING RING. The telephone. The bedside CLOCK reads: One o’clock. She grabs the phone.
C: BABY
D: Hello?
S: EXT. SAUGERTIES POLICE STATION - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
N: Baby’s silver Mercedes is parked in the lot, beside an old PICK UP TRUCK. The station door opens. Baby comes out, followed by Carlos’s parents: ESME and JULIO, both 40s. Behind them, Jake and Carlos. Carlos limps. Leaning on Jake.
C: JAKE
D: Dude, are you gonna be okay? They don’t look too happy.
E: whispers
C: CARLOS
D: I’m more worried about Cami when she finds out I can’t dance.
S: INT. BABY’S CAR - ON THE WAY BACK TO KELLERMAN’S
C: JAKE
D: Calm down, it’s not a big deal. We’ll get, like, a warning maybe.
C: BABY
D: I’m starting to understand your mother’s usual pissed-at-you thing.
C: JAKE
D: It’s not like we stole it.
C: BABY
D: Was it your car?
C: JAKE
D: No, but--
C: BABY
D: Then you stole it. But you’re right. They’ll probably just let you off with a warning.
E: doesn’t want to admit it
S: EXT. MAIN RESORT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Baby’s car pulls up to the front. Jake gets out. Slams the door. Walks toward the Nature Trail. Baby gets out.
C: BABY
D: Jake. I’m leaving in the morning.
N: He stops and turns, sullen. He knows he should say goodbye, he should thank her, and he wants to. But:
C: JAKE
D: Okay.
N: Baby watches him go. That’s all? She sighs, looks for the Valet. Another young Latino staffer walks by. That’s not him.
C: VALET
D: Right here. Sorry, ma’am.
E: O.S.
N: He hurries toward her from the lawn. She gives him her keys.

C: CARLOS
D: I’m just trying to apologize--
E: O.S.
N: She turns. Nearby: Carlos and Mr. Stanton. Carlos is on crutches, a MEDICAL BOOT on his foot.
C: STANTON
D: I suggest you get an attorney.
N: Baby walks over.
C: BABY
D: You’re pressing charges? For what? I understand you’re upset, but he didn’t mean anything by it. Your car is okay. Not even a scratch.
C: STANTON
D: Kids like him are all the same. Better to get them off the streets when they’re young.
C: BABY
D: Kids like him? What does that mean?
C: STANTON
D: What is this about? Do I know you?
N: Baby looks to Carlos. He looks like he might cry any second.
C: BABY
D: I’m his attorney.
S: INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

S: EXT. MAIN RESORT - VERANDA
N: Baby makes notes on a legal pad. Focused.

C: CAMILA
D: Haven’t you done enough? Go away.
N: Carlos hobbles out the door.
C: JAKE
D: Dude. They usually just let us go.
C: CAMILA
D: Of course, they let you go, you ignorant ass. They have different rules for you.
N: She goes back inside. Slams the door.
C: JAKE
D: Wait, what?
C: CARLOS
D: Nothing. She’s just mad.
C: JAKE
D: If that dumb cop hadn’t driven by--
C: CARLOS
D: Your friend’s going to help me. Frances. She said not to worry about it. But... Cami’s going to lose her shot at the scholarship. It’s not twisted. It’s fractured.
E: re: his booted foot
C: JAKE
D: Can’t she just dance by herself?
C: CARLOS
D: No. It’s a partner dance.
C: JAKE
D: Then find her another partner.
C: CARLOS
D: I’d love to. I just want to fix this for her. I knew better than--
N: Wait. He scans Jake’s body. They’re about the same size.
C: CARLOS
D: You do it. You be her partner.
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: Right. She won’t even speak to me.
C: CARLOS
D: She’ll have to if you’re her partner.
N: Fair point, and tempting. Jake thinks on it.
C: JAKE
D: She’ll never go for it.
C: CARLOS
D: Leave that to me. You just be at the staff party tonight.
C: JAKE
D: And what about, I’m not a dancer?
C: CARLOS
D: Sure you are. It’s in your blood.
S: INT. DINING ROOM / RESTAURANT
N: Baby and Noah have dinner. Baby’s laughing.
C: BABY
D: A wedding planner? You?
C: NOAH
D: Whaddya think, I just hang out at event venues all summer? I’m arranging the Silverman wedding.
C: BABY
D: The Silverman wedding? That’s big time. You must be pretty good.
C: NOAH
D: I am really good. Because I happen to believe in love.
C: BABY
D: You’re still young. You’ll grow out of it.
S: INT. CAMILA’S BEDROOM
N: On the walls: Photographs of old-school starlets: Rita Moreno. Cyd Charisse. Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. There’s only one modern photo: JENNIFER LOPEZ as a FLY GIRL.
C: CAMILA
D: I’d rather chew glass.
C: CARLOS
D: Come on, Cami. His dad was a dancer. He’ll be a natural. And he’s exactly my size. He’ll fit into my outfit. He’s perfect.
C: CAMILA
D: He is far from perfect.
C: CARLOS
D: Taking that car was dumb. It might ruin my life. I’ll never forgive myself if it ruins yours, too.
E: beat
N: Camila sits on the bed. Stares at the starlets. Her dreams.
S: INT. REHEARSAL CABIN - SAME TIME
N: Jake’s found some old memorabilia. PHOTOS. Young people from the 1950s. Poodle skirts and pompadours. Then from the 1960s. Peddle-pushers and Keds. Until he comes to... A PHOTO of a man in the center of a group of DANCERS. Tight white T-shirt. Smoldering eyes. Johnny Castle, circa 1963. Jake stares at the photo. He goes to the wall-length mirror, mimics Johnny’s pose. Is it in his blood?
S: EXT. LAKESIDE CLEARING - THAT NIGHT
N: The Lighthouse BEACON sweeps over the water. String-lights twinkle. Music plays. Staffers loiter and dance in the open area. Jake mingles among the staffers. He sees Carlos crutching his way toward him. But no Camila.
C: CARLOS
D: She said no. Well, she said more than that, but the answer is no.
N: Jake’s disappointed, but kinda relieved. Then...
C: CAMILA
D: Okay, let’s see what you’ve got.
E: O.S.
C: CARLOS
D: You’re here! I knew you would...
N: Camila walks up to them. Looks Jake up and down. She nods. The crowd parts as she walks to the dancefloor.
C: JAKE
D: Shouldn’t we practice or something?
C: CAMILA
D: It’s now or never, Jake.
N: Someone changes the music. Jake straightens. He’s got this. He moves to join her. Camila pulls him close. For a moment, they move together. They look good. Then she proceeds to out-dance him so spectacularly that he’s left standing still as she dances around him. Twirls, spins, deft footwork. And everyone has stopped dancing to watch. The music stops. Camila slinks back to him. Sexy. Dominant.
C: CAMILA
D: Is that enough attention for you?
E: CONT'D
N: She laughs. Jake doesn’t. Her eyes meet Carlos’s. He’s disappointed in her. He limps away. Shit. To Jake:
C: CAMILA
D: I wish you’d never come here.
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: Yeah. Same.
N: He walks away.
S: INT. DINING ROOM / RESTAURANT
N: Baby and Noah are on the small dancefloor. It’s a simple Salsa. Baby’s surefooted. Graceful. Then Noah changes it up. He moves differently. Pulls her closer. Baby stiffens.
C: NOAH
D: Forget the steps. Just follow me.
N: He moves in rhythm with the music. Baby tries to relax.
C: NOAH
D: That’s it. Let me lead you.
E: CONT'D
N: He pulls her even closer. For a second, she melts. Then she steps back, gives herself a little space.
C: BABY
D: Noah? I’m technically still married, you know.
C: NOAH
D: Attorneys and your technicalities.
N: But he takes a proper stance. And they Salsa.
S: EXT. NATURE TRAIL
N: Jake catches up with Carlos.
C: JAKE
D: Whew, that was--
C: CARLOS
D: I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Jake. I feel like I set you up for that.
C: JAKE
D: Nah, it wasn’t that bad. Barely a flesh wound.
C: CARLOS
D: It was a stupid idea. She can’t get an audition tape ready with a new partner. Not in ten days.
C: JAKE
D: What’s in ten days?
C: CARLOS
D: The Silverman wedding. Mrs. Silverman is on the board of Tisch. Cami wanted to give her the tape in person. But thanks anyway. For trying.
N: Jake stops. He’s looking at... the Rehearsal Cabin.
S: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER
N: Jake stands outside Baby’s room. He hesitates. Then knocks.
S: INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Baby and Jake sit by the window. Jake’s quiet. Finally:
C: JAKE
D: So... when my dad taught you to dance, how long did that take?
C: BABY
D: Well, I--
C: JAKE
D: I mean, like a week? Ten days?
C: BABY
D: What’s this about, Jake?
C: JAKE
D: I need you to teach me to dance.
E: long beat
S: INT. REHEARSAL CABIN - NEXT MORNING
N: The RECORD PLAYER is set up. Baby puts an album on. Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons: Big Girls Don’t Cry. Her hair falls in casual, loose curls. She wears denim shorts and a button-up shirt. She ties the bottom of her shirt, unconsciously mimicking her look from that summer. She looks around the cluttered room. Time to work. She starts clearing the center of the room.
S: EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - AFTERNOON
N: Jake carries a BAG OF CEMENT on his shoulder. Baby walks by. Gives him a thumbs-up. He smiles. It’s on!

D: Wow. You look--
C: BABY
D: Sorry. I’ve been moving boxes.

E: listens listens
S: INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM, BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: She turns on the shower. Catches sight of herself in the mirror. YOUNG BABY looks back. No... she looks down at herself, the hair, the shirt, the shorts. She looks back at the mirror. It’s not YOUNG BABY. It’s her.
S: INT. FLORES HOUSE, KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER
N: Baby, showered and changed, sits at the table with Julio, Esme, Carlos, and Camila.
C: BABY
D: They’re probably going to charge you with something called Joyriding. You’ll likely get a fine, and maybe a short probation, since it’s your first offense.
N: Esme slaps Carlos upside the head.
C: ESME
D: ¿Ves lo que has hecho?
C: CARLOS
D: Ow, Mamá.
N: Camila slaps him, too. He glares at her.
C: CARLOS
D: At least I’m not a quitter.
E: CONT'D
N: Camila fumes, stands up. Leaves the room. Carlos sighs, miserable. Baby reaches across. Touches his hand.
C: BABY

N: The 5:00 group dance class is winding down. Camila says goodbye to the guests. Carlos sulks against the railing. He perks up when he sees... ...Jake. Headed straight for them. Full of Castle swagger. Now Camila sees him, too. Ugh. He walks right up to her.
C: JAKE
D: You have ten days, right? All I’m asking for is a week. One week to learn the dance.
C: CAMILA
D: You couldn’t learn the dance in one year. It’s too hard.
C: CARLOS
D: But we could modify it. Yeah! You do all the flashy stuff. Cami, this is your dream. It’s my dream for you. I know I screwed it up, but please, won’t you at least try? For me?
E: jumps in pleading
N: A long beat. Camila eyes them both. Shit.
S: EXT. KELLERMAN’S GARDEN - EVENING
N: A perfectly manicured English Garden, complete with benches, topiaries, lighted cobblestone paths, and lots of roses.
C: BABY
D: ...and the prosecutor’s on a fishing trip, so who knows when.
C: NOAH
D: Well, if you’re still here in two weeks, I could use a date for the wedding...?
N: Baby glances at him. She stops to smell a perfect rose.
C: BABY
D: This garden wasn’t here before. I wonder when they put it in?
C: NOAH
D: Last week.
C: BABY
D: I mean, the whole thing.
C: NOAH
D: Last week.
C: BABY
D: Noah. These are mature trees. The rose bushes--
C: NOAH
D: --were flown in from England. All of this was done last week. Ariel Silverman wanted it. So she got it. Told you I’m good at my job.

D: May I escort the lady to dinner?
E: CONT'D

D: Who is that?
C: BABY
D: My husband.
N: Baby hurries away from Noah, toward the car.
S: EXT. MAIN RESORT - CONTINUOUS
N: Baby reaches the car just as Lola and Lisa get out.

C: BABY
D: I told you I could handle it.
N: Lola runs up to her mom. Wraps arms around her.
C: LOLA
D: Did you miss me?
C: BABY
D: Like crazy, my love.
N: Lisa lugs a suitcase from the trunk. The Valet takes it. Baby glares at her. She’s part of this?
C: LISA
D: It’s Kellerman’s. I had to. Does it look smaller to you? Oh. Well, hello handsome.
E: looks around sees Noah
N: Noah walks past them. Gives Baby a long look. Glances at the rose, still in her hand. Baby looks down at the rose. Shit. Noah pulls his eyes from her and walks inside.
C: DANIEL
D: Helping out a kid, huh? Is he legal, at least?
S: INT. BABY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: A pair of linen pants lay across the bed. Baby takes off her denim shorts. Looks up to see Daniel.

D: We’re separated. I wonder why?
E: mutters
C: DANIEL
D: Who was that guy downstairs?
N: She throws her denim shorts at him. He catches them.
C: DANIEL
D: He’s half your age, Fran--
E: CONT'D
C: BABY
D: Jesus, Dan. I’m not screwing him, okay? He’s just a wedding planner, here for an event. Leave it alone.
N: Daniel considers that. He leaves the room.
S: INT. BABY'S HOTEL ROOM, LIVING ROOM AREA
N: Baby comes in dressed for dinner. She’s reverted to sleek, refined Baby. Not the soft, casual Baby we just saw. Daniel has her legal pad out, reading over her notes. She snatches it away from him just as-- KNOCK KNOCK. She goes to the door. Lisa and Lola come in.
C: LISA
D: Room keys!
N: She gives a key to Daniel.
C: LISA
D: Now, dinner. I’m starving.
E: CONT'D
C: BABY
D: I thought maybe we’d go to town. We don’t need to have dinner here--
C: LISA
D: No way. I’m celebrating my first night back at Kellerman’s, crappy food and all. Bring it on.
S: INT. MAIN RESORT BUILDING, DINING ROOM / RESTAURANT
N: Baby and her family are seated at a center table. Neil’s stopped by the table to chat up Lisa.
C: NEIL
D: Your Aunt Lisa was the belle of the ball that summer. She really was.
E: to Lola
N: His eyes gleam as they rove over Lisa. She flirts right back.
C: LISA
D: You hush right now, Neil Kellerman.
N: Baby’s fidgety. Uncomfortable. Watching the door.
C: DANIEL
D: Where’s that kid? Jake?
C: BABY
D: In his cabin, I imagine.
C: DANIEL
D: He’s still here, too?
N: Lisa shoots a look to Baby. Jake’s here, too?
C: NEIL
D: Another Castle at Kellerman’s. How’s that for a hoot? Least he’s not a dancer, so he won’t be getting handsy with the guests--
C: BABY
D: Excuse me. I need to go to the, um--
N: She stands. But just then... Noah walks in. His eyes meet Baby’s. Shit. She hesitates between standing and sitting. Lisa sees Noah. Oh!

S: INT. LADIES BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Baby comes in, Lisa hot on her tail.
C: LISA
D: Who? What? When? Where? And how many times?
C: BABY
D: For god sake’s Lisa.
C: LISA
D: This place is really good to you. First Johnny Castle, now that hunk of prime.
N: Nope. Baby turns around and walks right back out.
S: INT. MAIN RESORT BUILDING, DINING ROOM / RESTAURANT - LATER
N: Middle of dinner. Neil has pulled up a chair and made himself at home. Baby picks at her food. Neil chats up Daniel.
C: NEIL
D: And so the first thing I did was build a cigar room.
C: DANIEL
D: You have a cigar room?
E: perks up
C: LOLA
D: Gross, Dad.
C: NEIL
D: And the best Cognac you can get your hands on.
N: His voice fades as Baby sneaks glances at Noah, alone at a nearby table. Picking at his own dinner.
S: INT. MAIN RESORT LOBBY - LATER
N: Daniel and Neil walk out of the Dining room.
C: NEIL

C: LISA
D: Why can’t you? You have plans or something?
N: Baby sighs. Dear. God.
S: INT. REHEARSAL CABIN - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: The room’s cleared, boxes shoved into all corners. Baby has changed into athletic wear. She and Jake stand face to face.
C: BABY
D: Um, they insisted. Is that okay?
N: Lisa and Lola wait, hopeful.
C: JAKE
D: As long as you teach me to dance, I don’t care who’s watching.
C: BABY
D: You two run the music, then.
N: Lola trots to the record player. Lisa pulls out albums.
C: BABY
D: Something fast.
E: CONT'D
N: Lisa chooses an ALBUM. Baby pulls Jake to stand in front of her. Sizes him up.
C: BABY
D: First thing... frame. This is your dance space. This is my dance space.
E: CONT'D pulls his arms up lifts her own arms
N: Jake stands taller. Locks his ‘frame’. Lola puts the needle down. Music PLAYS. Baby’s talking low, we can’t quite hear her. She puts her hand over his heart, her fingers tapping softly... Lola watches, enraptured. Lisa leans down, whispers:
C: LISA
D: You know what full-circle means?
S: EXT. NATURE TRAIL
N: The little group say their goodnights. Jake walks toward his cabin. Baby and Lisa turn to go. Lola watches Jake walk away.

N: Baby smiles sweetly. So true.
S: INT. JAKE’S CABIN - LATER

S: INT. FRONT DESK
C: BABY
D: Do I have any messages from the courthouse?
C: CONCIERGE
D: No, ma’am. But someone did leave this for you.
N: The Concierge gives her a small card and a ROSE, the same kind of rose Noah gave her earlier. She pulls out the card. The front of the card says: For you. She smiles. Turns the card over and it reads: Love, Dan. Her smile drops.
S: INT. DANIEL’S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: He opens the door. Baby, rose in hand, walks inside.
C: BABY
D: ‘Love, Dan’? Are you kidding me?
C: DANIEL
D: What? I do love you.
C: BABY
D: Jealousy doesn’t look good on you.
C: DANIEL
D: So you’re saying I should be jealous.
C: BABY
D: No, Counselor. I’m saying, go home. You have no reason to be here.

C: BABY
D: We’re getting divorced, Noah.
C: NOAH

N: Baby looks up at him. God, he’s sweet.
C: BABY
D: You want to ride to town with me?

D: What are you doing here?
C: JAKE
D: Why are you watching these old people? This isn’t how you dance.
C: CAMILA
D: I love all dance. That’s why I wanted to go to Tisch.
C: JAKE
D: Wanted? That’s the point, isn’t it? Of me learning to dance?
C: CAMILA
D: The scholarship is dead. I know that. But I need for Carlos to forgive himself. So we’ll fake it for ten days, pretend to get along. We’ll make a shitty tape that I’ll never turn in, and then we’re done.

N: Baby argues with the PROSECUTOR’S CLERK.
C: CLERK
D: I’m sorry, but he’s--

C: CLERK
D: Excuse me, ma’am, but--
C: BABY
D: Tell him Frances Houseman is here. I’m the attorney for Carlos Flores and I want to speak with him. Now.

D: I’m charging your client...
C: BABY
D: You’re prosecuting this. Yourself?
C: LESTER
D: It is my job.
C: BABY
D: Fine. At best, the charge should be Joyriding. He’s a kid, with no priors. He didn’t steal the car with the intent to--
C: LESTER
D: I don’t know what his intent was, Ms. Houseman, and neither do you. What I do know is that he stole a two hundred thousand dollar car.
N: Baby’s about to argue when he adds:
C: LESTER
D: And had he not run it into a ditch, your young Mr. Flores could be in Mexico with it by now.
E: CONT'D
C: BABY
D: Mexico. I see.
E: long beat
C: LESTER
D: I’m glad you do. Please have your client here for his arraignment. Your best bet... is a guilty plea.

C: NOAH
D: Hold on. What’s going on?
E: CONT'D
C: BABY
D: I just need to get back. Okay?
S: INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM, LIVING ROOM AREA
N: Baby fumes. Daniel, still in his golf togs, sits pensively.
C: BABY
D: That racist, arrogant--
C: DANIEL
D: He’s right, though.
C: BABY
D: What? He is so wrong!
C: DANIEL
D: Within the confines of the law, Frances, he’s right. They’re going to make the argument that Carlos would never have returned the car--
C: BABY
D: Yes, he was going to return it!
C: DANIEL
D: But can you prove that?
C: BABY
D: He had thirty-three dollars in his pocket, no bank account, and no credit cards to his name. He would have run out of gas before he reached the city.
C: DANIEL
D: Or... he only had thirty-three dollars in his pocket, no money to open a bank account, and a two hundred thousand dollar stolen car--
N: She stops. Glares at him.
C: BABY
D: I hate it when you’re logical.
C: DANIEL
D: No, you don’t.
N: Their eyes meet. A spark. Heat. He stands up. Goes to her.
C: DANIEL
D: I love you like this.
E: CONT'D
C: BABY
D: Nope.
C: DANIEL
D: I do.
N: She considers it. Then pushes him away.
C: BABY
D: Focus.
C: DANIEL
D: Alright, then. What about the other boy? Jake.
C: BABY
D: Nothing. They’re acting like he wasn’t even there.
C: DANIEL
D: Didn’t he instigate it?
C: BABY
D: I’m not throwing Jake under the bus. I’ll find another way.
N: Daniel nods. His eyes linger on her lips. Baby wavers.
C: BABY
D: You should go.
E: CONT'D
N: She pushes him toward the door... and out. She closes the door. Whew. That was close. But now... she’s all keyed up.
S: INT. JAKE’S CABIN
N: He comes in after a shower. Wet hair. Low-slung lounge pants. Shirtless. Towel around his neck.
C: CAMILA
D: Jake. Is there any chance...
E: O.S.
N: Jake turns. Camila’s standing in the open door. Her eyes involuntarily lock on his naked skin. He pulls the towel from his neck, stands straight, lets her look at him.
C: CAMILA
D: Um... any chance we can start at seven thirty instead of eight?
E: CONT'D
N: He smiles that sexy smile.
C: JAKE
D: I’ll be there.
S: EXT. LISA’S HOTEL ROOM
N: Lisa and Lola are crashed out on the bed, in hotel robes. Face down. Baby walks in.
C: BABY
D: You guys ready-- what’s going on?
N: Lisa’s muffled voice comes from the bed:
C: LISA
D: No dinner. Must rest.
C: BABY
D: What the hell happened?
N: They both stir. Sit up. Sunburned faces. Lola looks tired, but Lisa looks beat to hell.
C: LISA
D: Pedal boats are the devil.
C: LOLA
D: We got stuck in the middle of the lake ‘cause Aunt Lisa didn’t want to pedal anymore.
C: LISA
D: Do you know how big that lake is?
C: LOLA
D: They had to come get us in a canoe.
N: They both plop back down. Baby smothers a laugh.
S: EXT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
N: Baby comes out of the room. Thinks.
S: EXT. ANOTHER HOTEL CORRIDOR
N: Baby knocks on a door. Noah answers. Surprised to see her.
C: BABY
D: Wanna go dancing? Somewhere else. Away from here.
S: INT. BALLROOM
N: Jake walks in. Camila and Carlos are already there.
C: CAMILA
D: We’ve reworked the dance so you’re doing a few basic moves, but mostly just standing there. Let’s start with your frame.
N: Jake walks up to her. Stands like Baby taught him.
C: CARLOS
D: Look who came to play.
S: INT. SMALL DANCE CLUB - SAUGERTIES, NY - THAT NIGHT
N: A small venue filled with the town’s young people. Drinking, smoking, dancing. In the middle of the kids: Baby and Noah. Baby still holds herself apart from him. But she’s trying. A little looser. A little more free.
S: INT. BALLROOM
N: Jake and Camila are sweaty. Tired. Frustrated.
C: CARLOS
D: Guys, look. This was just the first time. It’s going to be rough. But we can do this. I know we can.
N: Camila and Jake share a look. Fake it.
C: CAMILA
D: You’ve got this, Jake.
E: with false cheer
N: Jake shakes out his arms and legs. Carlos starts the music. They try again. He can’t get the steps. Shit.
C: CAMILA
D: Watch me. One-two-turn-three...
E: CONT'D
N: She patiently shows him the sequence: one-two-turn-three... MONTAGE - DAYS PASS -- REHEARSAL CABIN: Jake watches Baby’s feet. They become... -- BALLROOM: ...Camila’s feet -- a BLUR of precise motion. -- FLORES HOME: Baby’s at the table with the whole family, a file and her legal pad in front of her. -- JAKE’S CABIN: Jake practices in the mirror, his dad’s photo propped up, as if it’s watching him. -- DANCE CLUB: Baby and Noah dance. She’s looser. More free. -- GROUNDS: Paul hands out paychecks. Jake opens his. Smiles. -- REHEARSAL CABIN: Jake’s feet move faster. He’s got it! Lisa and Lola applaud. He takes Baby’s hand. TWIRLS her out. She SPINS away... -- BALLROOM: ...and Camila slinks sexily back to him. He swirls her around then PULLS her hard against his chest. He’s confident. Sexy as hell... END MONTAGE - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS ...as he looks down at Camila, pressed against his chest. She pulls away. Flustered.
C: CAMILA
D: That’s, um, you’re a fast learner.
N: He goes to grab his water. Camila’s eyes lock on his every move. She’s feeling it. God, he’s so... she turns away.
C: CARLOS
D: Dios mio.
E: fans himself
S: EXT. NATURE TRAIL - EARLY EVENING
N: Camila, Carlos, and Jake walk home. All tired. Jake peels off at his cabin.
C: JAKE
D: Same time tomorrow?
C: CAMILA
D: Yep.
N: She and Carlos keep walking.
C: CARLOS
D: You know, he’s getting really good.
N: She can’t argue that. She turns to watch Jake go into his cabin. Carlos catches her looking.
C: CARLOS
D: I know, right?
E: CONT'D
C: CAMILA
D: Zip it.
S: EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - DAY
N: The new gazebo is complete. The new brick walkway is complete. All the new structures are nearing completion.
S: INT. MAIN RESORT, LOBBY - EARLY EVENING
N: Jake’s at the concierge desk. He slips his PAYCHECK into an envelope. Seals it up. A couple of guests come out of the Ballroom, followed by Camila. Jake sees her. Smiles. She walks over to him.
C: CAMILA
D: Fake Jake. What are you doing?
C: JAKE
D: Sending money to my mom.
C: CAMILA
D: Wow. You’re a good son.
C: JAKE
D: No. I’m really not.
N: The words surprise him. Camila watches the emotions cross his face. Makes a decision:
C: CAMILA
D: You wanna take a fake walk down by the fake lake?
S: EXT. LAKEFRONT DOCK - SUNDOWN
N: Jake and Camila stand on the dock. The Lighthouse Beacon makes its journey. The beam washes over them, then moves on.
C: CAMILA
D: You know, we may be faking those rehearsals--
C: JAKE
D: I’m not faking it. I never was.
C: CAMILA
D: I know. That’s why I may still have a shot at that scholarship. Why do you think you’re a bad son?
E: beat
N: A long beat.
C: JAKE
D: Before my dad died, he made me and my mom promise we’d be there for each other. That we’d stick together. I didn’t keep my promise. Neither did she. It was just too hard. I let him down.
E: beat
N: The Lighthouse Beacon makes another sweep. Camila reaches for Jake’s hand, but she pulls back just before she touches him.
C: CAMILA
D: Johnny Castle’s kind of a legend around here. To the staff, I mean.
E: MORE
C: CAMILA
D: You must have inherited his talent. You’re learning crazy fast.
E: CONT'D
N: He likes being compared to his dad. He smiles. Then admits:
C: JAKE
D: Well, okay. If I’m honest, I’ve had a lot of help. Frances has been teaching me, too.
C: CAMILA
D: Frances, my brother’s attorney?
C: JAKE
D: Yeah. My dad taught her one summer, in the ‘60s. Apparently, it was--
C: CAMILA
D: Wait. No. Is Frances... Baby? As in, Baby and Johnny?
S: INT. SMALL DANCE CLUB - SAME TIME
N: Baby dances. She’s free. Having a great time. Noah dances up behind her. She turns and together they’re fluid, intense, hot. Noah is dying. Baby’s into it, too. She runs her hand through his hair.
C: NOAH
D: Are we finally on a date?
E: whispers
N: Baby chuckles, pulls his face down to hers.
C: BABY
D: Don’t get ahead of yourself.
N: Then she kisses him. And it is HOT. Then she pulls away.
C: NOAH
D: Wait. Come back.
C: BABY
D: Dancing. That’s why we’re here.
N: She dances away from him. Sexy. He pulls her back to him.
S: INT. REHEARSAL CABIN - LATER
N: Camila looks around. Excited to be there.
C: CAMILA
D: I’ve never been in here. I thought it was just storage.
N: She goes to the record player. Chooses an album. Something old. Otis Redding on vinyl. She puts the needle down. Music fills the room.
C: JAKE
D: Frances said this is where my dad taught her. Now she’s teaching me.
N: That touches Camila. Deeply. She turns away. He misunderstands.
C: JAKE
D: I’m sorry. I know Frances isn’t the only one teaching me. You are, too.
E: CONT'D
N: He reaches for her hand. God. She can’t take him being sweet.
C: CAMILA
D: Don’t.
C: JAKE
D: I just... what I was trying to say is, having her teach me, in here, is the closest thing to having my dad teach me. I wish he could have. I never saw him dance. Not once.
E: long beat
N: He moves back. Bumps a box and jostles the 8MM VIDEO REELS. They clatter to the floor. One rolls to his feet, spins for a moment, then falls on its side. He picks it up. MOMENTS LATER Jake sets up the VIDEO PROJECTOR. He turns the lights out. The only light now is the moon through the windows. CU: RECORD PLAYER. Scratchy silence as the needle moves to the next song. Another old, slow one: THESE ARMS OF MINE. At the projector, Jake hits PLAY and on the wall: his dad comes to life. It’s a reel of Johnny dancing. Jake stares.
C: CAMILA
D: Now that guy can dance.
C: JAKE
D: That’s him. That’s my dad.
N: Camila looks at Jake. His eyes are glued to Johnny. Healthy. Smiling. Dancing. Jake fights the emotion welling up in him. And Camila weakens. She pulls him into her arms. They slow dance under Johnny’s smiling eyes. Feeling everything. The song ends. They stand like that, not moving. Then Camila steps away. And leaves. Jake watches her go. Turns to his dad. And Johnny dances.
S: EXT. MAIN RESORT, VERANDA - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Daniel and Neil smoke cigars on the veranda. Chummy. Baby’s car drives up to the Valet. Baby gets out. She’s laughing. Flushed.
C: DANIEL
D: There you are. I’ve been looking f--
N: The passenger door opens. Noah gets out. The men’s eyes meet. Daniel calmly puts out his cigar. Goes inside. Noah comes around the car. Tries to take Baby’s hand. She subtly pulls away. Okay. He goes inside. Finally, the Valet runs up. Takes Baby’s keys. Neil leans over the veranda railing, puffs as Baby heads inside.
C: NEIL
D: Frances.
E: smirks
C: BABY
D: Neil.
E: not having it
S: INT. REHEARSAL CABIN - SAME TIME
N: Jake switches out the reel. More Johnny. More dancing. Learning the part of his dad he never knew.
S: INT. DANIEL'S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Daniel answers the KNOCK on his door. Baby comes in.
C: BABY
D: Where’s Lola?
C: DANIEL
D: Where she always is.
N: A SUITCASE is open on the bed. He’s packing.
C: BABY
D: What are you doing?
C: DANIEL
D: You said you wanted space and I didn’t listen. But I hear you now. I’ll have Tom expedite the divorce papers. You’ll have your space.
N: Baby watches him pack for a long moment. Then:
C: BABY
D: Thanks. I appreciate that.
N: Daniel stares at her. Not at all what he expected her to say.
C: DANIEL
D: Jesus Christ, Frances. What are you doing here? Do you even know?
C: BABY
D: I’m helping Carlos Flores.
C: DANIEL
D: No, you’re not. You’re going to plead him out because that’s all you can do. You’re here to relive some teenage summer-love fantasy.
N: He slams his suitcase shut. Heads to the door.
C: DANIEL
D: That boy, Noah? He’s playing with you, and you’re falling for it. There was a time when I would have been surprised by that. Tell Lola I’ll see her when she gets home.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM, LIVING ROOM AREA - MOMENTS LATER
N: Baby comes in. Hears laughter from the bedroom.
S: INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Lisa and Lola are on the bed, watching a movie. Beauty masks on their faces. Bottles of nail polish strewn on the bed. They carefully eat popcorn with freshly polished fingers.
C: LOLA
D: Movies and masks, Mom. Want one?
C: BABY
D: I’ll skip the mask, but thanks.
N: She climbs onto the bed between them. Wraps her arms around Lola. Lisa can tell something’s wrong. She wraps her arms around both of them. Baby closes her eyes, accepts the love.
S: INT. BABY'S HOTEL ROOM, BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
N: Baby opens her eyes. The TV flickers in the dark. She sits up. Lisa and Lola are sound asleep on either side of her.
S: EXT. MAIN RESORT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Baby walks out on the big front porch. She looks out at the Kellerman’s grounds, whispers:
C: BABY
D: What am I doing here?
N: Then she sees someone. Down by the lake, standing in the NEW GAZEBO. It’s all shadows and darkness, but... is that? Tall. Broad shouldered. Tight white T-shirt. It looks exactly like: Johnny. She knows it can’t be him, but she walks...
S: EXT. FRONT LAWN
N: ...across the lawn... down the slope... getting closer. It’s not a figment. He’s there. He’s right there.
S: INT. NEW GAZEBO - CONTINUOUS
N: She walks quietly into the structure. Hesitant. In disbelief. He’s at the railing, his back to her. She can’t be seeing this. It’s not possible. Is it?
C: BABY
D: H... hey.
N: He turns. It’s Jake, tears on his face. He wipes them away as she joins him at the railing. She puts her hand over his.
C: BABY
D: I miss him, too.
E: CONT'D
N: Jake takes a tiny step closer to her. With their shoulders touching, they watch the water.
S: EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - NEXT MORNING
N: Jake walks to Paul, tired and bleary-eyed, but ready to work.
C: PAUL
D: You getting any sleep? You’re on the roof today. Get going.
N: Jake gives him a thumbs-up. Heads to work.
C: PAUL
D: Hey. You’re doing good work, kid.
E: CONT'D calls
N: Jake can’t fight a smile.
S: INT. SAUGERTIES COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON
N: Baby waits outside the JUDGE’S CHAMBERS.
S: INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - A LITTLE LATER
N: The JUDGE sits behind her desk, a file open in front of her. Carlos’s MUG SHOT stares out.
C: JUDGE
D: You can’t argue discrimination when the kid actually took the car. Plead no contest and I’ll try to work with you on the sentencing.
C: BABY
D: My client is going to start his adult life with a felony, just because some racist prick wants to make an example of him?
C: JUDGE
D: Because he stole a car. And as much I agree with you that they’re overcharging the case, Mr. Stanton is within his rights here. And the D.A.’s backing him up. The arraignment’s in a week.
E: beat MORE
C: JUDGE
D: I suggest you break the news to your client. He’s going to have a record.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. JAKE’S CABIN - SAME TIME
N: Jake still in his work shirt, sits on his stoop. Beside him, an envelope and his paycheck. He has a NOTEPAD on his lap. He stares at the paper. Thinks. Then he starts to write. CU on notepad: Dear Mom. Let me start by saying I’m sorry. I made Dad a promise...
S: EXT. OUTSIDE EATING AREA
N: Lisa and Baby have salads. Baby stabs at hers.
C: BABY
D: ...so they’re going forward.
C: LISA
D: With Grand Theft? That’s a felony.
C: BABY
D: Yep. The judge wants to help, but her hands are tied.
N: Lola walks up. Plops into a chair.
C: LOLA
D: Just got off the phone with Dad. Sounds like he’s going to stop trying to win you back.
C: BABY
D: Are you okay with that? You know we will always love you and be there for you. Both of us. But--
E: long beat
C: LOLA
D: Mom, I’ll be honest.
N: Lola glances at Lisa.
C: LISA
D: It’s okay. Tell her.
N: Baby looks between them. What’s going on?
C: LOLA
D: I love you, okay?
N: She puts her hand over Baby’s. Very teenage-adult.
C: LOLA
D: At home, you were wearing green shirts and throwing parties and being all perfect-y. That’s Aunt Lisa, that’s not you. Here, you’re different. You’re kind of... wild. Dad may not love that. But I do.
E: CONT'D
N: Baby squeezes Lola’s hand. She grabs Lisa’s. Lola takes Lisa’s hand. The Houseman girls. Baby smiles. THWUMP THWUMP THWUMP. They all look up as a HELICOPTER flies overhead... and LANDS on the front lawn. Lola gawks. Neil hurries by them, flustered. Nervous. He speed-walks toward the chopper. Baby laughs at his frantic pace.
C: NOAH
D: Theeeey’re heeere.
E: O.S.
N: Baby looks up to see Noah, standing by their table.
C: NOAH
D: Hello, ladies. Would you like to meet the Silvermans?
E: CONT'D
N: The chopper powers down as two WOMEN emerge. ISABEL SILVERMAN (50s) and her daughter ARIEL (20s). Regal as queens.
C: LISA
D: Now that’s an entrance.
C: LOLA
D: Mom, let’s go meet them.
C: BABY
D: Uh, no. I left my tiara at home.
N: Lisa jumps up. Takes Lola’s hand.
C: LISA
D: I’ll go.
C: NOAH
D: That’s the spirit. See you later?
E: to Baby
N: Baby watches a line of expensive cars wind up the driveway.
C: BABY
D: The Silvermans are here. Every last one of them.
S: EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - LATER THAT DAY
N: People are BUSY. Neil is out front, like a conductor.
C: NEIL
D: Let’s go, people. We have three days to get this done.
S: INT. MAIN RESORT, LOBBY - NEXT DAY
N: Jake’s on a ladder. He holds a long GARLAND made of FRESH WHITE ROSES against the wall. The DECORATOR eyes it.
S: INT. BALLROOM - SAME TIME
N: A MINI-ORCHESTRA is set up in the back corner. Strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion -- they have it all. Camila and Carlos walk in as a dozen or so EXQUISITE BALLERINAS walk out. Like swans. Long and sleek.
C: CARLOS
D: Holy shit.
C: CAMILA
D: I know. It’s gonna be beautiful.
N: She watches the women leaves, her eyes full of admiration. They’re living the life she wants. Professional dancers. She shakes it off as Ariel and her groom TEDDY (20s) enter. Camila turns all sweet, polite business. Very professional.
C: CAMILA
D: I’m Camila. I’ll be teaching you your dance. You’ve chosen the Mambo. One of my favorites.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. NEW GAZEBO - EARLY EVENING
N: Jake attaches a last sheath of WHITE ROSES to the gazebo. He steps back to look at it. It’s beautiful.
S: INT. BALLROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Camila dances with Ariel. She leads Ariel into a turn. Looks to Teddy. Carlos stops the music.
C: CAMILA
D: Like that, Teddy. She’ll follow you if you lead her. Wanna try again?
N: Teddy takes Ariel into his arms. Carlos starts the music.
S: EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - EVENING
N: Noah is in his element. Directing workers and decorators. Baby watches from the veranda. He glances up at her. Smiles.
S: EXT. REHEARSAL CABIN - NIGHT
N: Jake hurries into the cabin, dressed to dance.
S: INT. BALLROOM - NEXT MORNING
N: NOTE: WE ARE NOW THREE DAYS BEFORE THE WEDDING. TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ARRAIGNMENT. Baby hurries in. A TRIPOD and VIDEO CAMERA are set up.
C: BABY
D: I know I’m late. It’s a madhouse out there-- oh, hey. What’s this?
N: Everyone’s there: Jake, Camila, Carlos, Lisa, Lola. Jake and Camila are in sexy DANCE COSTUMES. Camila and Carlos stare at Baby. Barely contained glee on their faces.
C: BABY
D: What’s going on?
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: The cat’s out of the bag.
C: BABY
D: Oh! You found out I was helping. Well, I wanted to--
C: CAMILA
D: We didn’t know you were Baby.
N: Baby blinks. She’s confused until:
C: LISA
D: The cat’s out of the bag... Baby.
N: Camila and Carlos are both grinning at Baby. Baby finally realizes... oh. She blushes, waves them away.
C: BABY
D: Okay, alright. You guys look... Is today the day?
E: to Jake and Camila
C: JAKE
D: Yep. And since we-- I-- couldn’t have done this without you...
C: CAMILA
D: We wanted to know if you’d be the one to tape us. Lend us some luck.
N: Baby’s touched. She grabs both their hands.
C: BABY
D: I’d be honored. Let’s do it.
N: Camila grabs Jake’s hand. Lola starts the music. The dance begins. But we don’t see the dance. We stay on Baby - behind the video camera. She watches Carlos. His happy, innocent face. She turns her attention to the camera. Filming.
S: INT. BABY’S HOTEL ROOM, LIVING ROOM AREA - THAT NIGHT
N: Baby and Lisa sit on the sofa, drinking wine. Lola’s at the window, staring out at the Lakeside Clearing in the distance. The lights. The dancing. The fun.
C: LOLA
D: Can’t we go down there? Please?
C: BABY
D: They don’t want guests down there.
C: LOLA
D: But we’re not guests, we’re us.
C: BABY
D: I’m sorry, honey. Not tonight.
N: Lola huffs. Goes in to the bedroom. We hear the TV come on.
C: BABY
D: The arraignment’s in two days. Carlos is expecting a Joyriding charge, because I--
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: You haven’t told him yet?
N: Baby shakes her head. Lisa winces. Yikes.
C: LISA
D: Baby, you have to tell him.
E: CONT'D
C: BABY
D: I just thought I could figure a way around it, because it’s so goddamned unfair. But I can’t.
S: EXT. LAKESIDE CLEARING - SAME TIME
N: The Lighthouse Beacon washes over Jake and Camila as they dance. And now, they’re the couple everyone watches. Jake’s good. Really good. He and Camila move together like water. They are a unit. Heat radiates from them. Carlos hangs by the railing, a huge grin on his face.
S: INT. BABY'S HOTEL ROOM, BEDROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT
N: Baby’s sitting up in bed, one hand on Lola, who has curled into her, asleep. But Baby can’t sleep. She’s too worried.
S: EXT. LAKESIDE DOCK - SAME TIME
N: Jake and Camila walk along the dock. She stops to lean against the railing. The Lighthouse Beacon washes over her face, then moves on. Jake’s mesmerized. She catches his look.
C: CAMILA
D: Stop it.
C: JAKE
D: You’re beautiful.
C: CAMILA
D: I mean it. Stop.
C: JAKE
D: Fine. I’ll stop saying it. But I won’t stop seeing it.
C: CAMILA
D: Jake, I’m... I’ve been focused my whole life. On dancing, on this scholarship, on my future. I don’t do anything lightly. I don’t... do casual. Ever.
N: The Lighthouse Beacon sweeps slowly over them again.
C: JAKE
D: I’ve been a fuck up pretty much since my dad died. I didn’t take anything seriously. But Camila, there’s nothing casual about the way I feel when I’m with you.
N: She turns to him. So close. His eyes close as her fingers trace his cheek, his lips. She pulls his head down. The Beacon washes them in soft light as their lips meet. It’s THE KISS. Passionate, perfect. He picks her up. Her legs wrap around his waist. They lose themselves in each other.
S: EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
N: Baby roams. Restless.
S: EXT. NATURE TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER
N: Baby walks. Deep in thought.
S: INT. OLD GAZEBO - CONTINUOUS
N: Baby walks past the old gazebo. Doesn’t even see it.
S: EXT. LITTLE BRIDGE
N: She walks across the bridge and...
S: EXT. STONE STEPS
N: ...where she doesn’t even look up until she gets to...
S: EXT. JOHNNY’S OLD CABIN
N: Jake’s cabin now. Baby stops. How did she end up here? A dim lamp shines inside. She hears talking. Laughter. Jake and Camila. Good for them. She turns, ready to head back... ...and sees a LIGHT is on in the Rehearsal Cabin. Huh.
S: INT. REHEARSAL CABIN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Baby comes up the stairs. No one’s there, of course. She reaches for the light switch. Turns it OFF. A BEAM OF MOONLIGHT shines through the window, right onto: The VIDEO PROJECTOR. It still has a reel on it. Curious, Baby walks over, presses PLAY. The wall lights up and Baby gasps. On the wall: Johnny dances. Baby sinks to sit on the floor. Her eyes linger on him, remembering everything. She watches him dance. Young. Beautiful. Happy.
C: BABY
D: What would you think of me now?
N: Johnny SPINS SPINS SPINS...
C: BABY
D: You believed I could change the world. But I didn’t do it, Johnny.
E: CONT'D
N: She fights tears...
C: BABY
D: And I’m trying. I’m trying to get back to the me you loved. The me I loved. But I don’t even know if I can. I don’t know what it feels like to... win anymore.
E: CONT'D
N: She lets out a harsh laugh through the tears.
C: BABY
D: Wouldn’t you know it? All this walking and worrying tonight and somehow I made my way to you. You were always there when I needed you. I’m sorry I wasn’t--
E: CONT'D
N: ...and then she finally lets herself cry.
C: BABY
D: I would have been there. You know that, right? Please know that.
E: CONT'D
N: STRONG ARMS come around her from behind. Johnny’s arms. She knows they’re not real, but she FEELS them. And we SEE them. She puts her arms around his, clutches them tightly. A long beat. Then she opens her eyes. His arms are no longer there. She’s hugging herself. She stands. Walks to the image of Johnny. She kisses her fingers. Touches them to his face. She walks out of the room, leaves Johnny dancing behind her.
S: INT. JAKE’S CABIN
N: Jake lies with Camila in his arms. He’s never been so happy.
S: EXT. MAIN RESORT, FRONT
N: A few cars are lined up in the front drive. Several MEN (20s) stagger toward the lobby doors, corralled by Noah. He sees Baby walking toward him.
C: BABY
D: You’re out late.
C: NOAH
D: A wedding planner’s job is never done. Meet the groom. Teddy Pope.
N: Teddy holds out a gallant, but unsteady hand to Baby.
C: TEDDY
D: Pleasure to meet you, miss.
E: mumbles drunkly
N: Noah gives Teddy’s car keys to the Valet. The other men shuffle toward the doors. They go inside.
C: NOAH
D: I’d say let’s get a drink, but--
C: BABY
D: You have your hands full.
N: Noah gives her a quick kiss on the cheek. Then, boldly, a soft, sweet kiss on her lips. He smiles. Leads Teddy inside. Baby touches her mouth. What the hell is she doing?
S: INT. FLORES HOUSE, KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING
N: Esme leads Baby to the table. Camila, Jake, Carlos, and Julio are having breakfast. They’re happy, laughing.
C: ESME
D: Look who’s here. Frances, will you join us?
N: She shakes her head. Jake, Camila, and Carlos share a look.
C: CARLOS
D: Something’s wrong. What is it?
S: INT. CAMILA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Camila SLAMS into her room. Grabs her DANCE BAG from the floor. DUMPS it. Shit scatters: dance shoes, binders, the Silverman photos, and... the VIDEO TAPE. She grabs it.
S: EXT. FLORES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Camila flies out the front door. She runs down the...
S: EXT. NATURE TRAIL
N: ...toward the lake. Jake runs after her.
C: JAKE
D: Camila! Cami, wait!
N: She just runs faster. In a desperate fury.
S: EXT. LAKEFRONT DOCK
N: She gets to the railing and--
C: JAKE
D: Camila, don’t!
N: --she SLINGS the tape into the lake. It hits with a PLUNK. It floats for a second, then... sinks.
C: JAKE
D: What are you doing?
E: CONT'D
C: CAMILA
D: It’s over. Those were stupid dreams. This is reality.
E: MORE
C: CAMILA
D: How the hell am I supposed to go off to dance school while he’s in jail for something he didn’t do?
E: CONT'D
N: She starts to cry. Jake reaches out for her. She jerks away.
C: JAKE
D: I’m sorry, Cami.
N: Then she grabs him. Clutches him. He pulls her close.
C: JAKE
D: I know how to fix this.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. FLORES HOUSE, KITCHEN
N: Camila comes in. She’s been crying.
C: CARLOS
D: Cami. Listen, I’ll be okay--
C: CAMILA
D: Jake’s going to the police station. He’s going to tell them it was his fault. That he was driving.
S: INT. JAKE’S CABIN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jake tucks his wallet into his back pocket. Baby comes in.
C: BABY
D: What do you think you’re doing?
C: JAKE
D: The right thing.
C: BABY
D: You going to jail instead of Carlos doesn’t fix anything.
C: JAKE
D: I won’t go to jail. We all know why they’re doing this to Carlos. They won’t do it to me. They never do. And even if they did, so what? I’m nothing. I got nothing. I’m going nowhere. It doesn’t matter.
N: Baby stares at Jake. It’s like a gut punch to her.
C: BABY JOHNNY
D: People treat me like I’m People treat me like I’m nothing because I’m nothing. nothing because I’m nothing.
E: V.O.
C: JAKE
D: What?
C: BABY
D: Johnny said that to me. He was standing where you’re standing right now. And he was scared. Scared that he was never going to be anything, or do anything important with his life. But Jake... he did.
N: Jake sits on the bed. What is she talking about?
C: BABY
D: Johnny gave up dancing for you. Willingly. Happily. He wanted to give you a good life, a stable life, the kind of life he never had. You were everything to him. You are not nothing, Jake Castle. You are your father’s son.
E: CONT'D
N: Jake looks at the photo of Johnny. His dad’s face. And starts to cry. Baby wraps him in her arms.
S: EXT. FLORES CABIN - LATER
N: Jake and Baby walk back to Camila’s. Camila comes onto the porch. She looks to Baby, who nods. It’s okay. Camila runs down the steps, into Jake’s arms.
S: EXT. KELLERMAN’S GROUNDS - EARLY NEXT EVENING
N: Paul’s handing out paychecks. Jake takes his with a grin.
S: EXT. OLD GAZEBO - SUNDOWN
N: Camila and Carlos sit on the rail. Jake stands behind them. They all watch the sunset. Quiet. Until...
C: CARLOS
D: I’m sorry, Cami. Your scholarship--
C: CAMILA
D: Forget it. I couldn’t dance now if I wanted to. Not when you’re...
N: She reaches for his hand. Carlos trembles.
C: CARLOS
D: I’m scared.
C: CAMILA
D: I know. Me, too.
N: Jake puts his arms around them both. As the sun sinks behind the watery horizon... the Lighthouse Beacon comes on.
S: INT. JAKE’S CABIN - NEXT MORNING
N: Jake’s in the best clothes he has there. Pressed shirt and jeans. He combs his hair. He looks nice.
S: INT. FLORES HOUSE, CAMILA'S BEDROOM
N: Camila smoothes her dress. Pulls her hair into a sleek pony.
S: INT. FLORES HOUSE, KITCHEN
N: Esme straightens a TIE on Carlos’s neck. Julio holds Carlos’s jacket. They fight tears.
C: CARLOS
D: Mamá--
N: And she breaks. Julio hugs his family.
S: EXT. MAIN RESORT, FRONT
N: Baby, Lisa, and Lola come out. They’re dressed for court. Nice, but not too nice. She’s nervous. Noah hurries out.
C: NOAH
D: Frances! Good luck today, Counselor.
E: she turns
C: BABY
D: There’s nothing good about today--
N: A pair of KEYS whizzes past her head. She ducks just in time. The Valet catches them, trots toward an idling SPORTS CAR.
C: GROOMSMAN
D: Take it easy with her.
N: He heads inside. As he passes Baby:
C: GROOMSMAN
D: Sorry about that.
E: CONT'D
C: BABY
D: No, it’s... fine.
N: Suddenly, she smiles. Confident. Sure. She kisses Noah hard on the mouth. He grins.
C: NOAH
D: What was that for?
C: BABY
D: Everybody in the car. Let’s go.
E: to Lisa and Lola
S: INT. SAUGERTIES COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM
N: Lisa and Lola have found seats with Jake, Camila, Esme, and Julio. Baby’s at the front with Carlos.
C: JUDGE
D: Carlos Flores is charged with one count of Grand Theft Auto. How does he plead?
N: Carlos starts to stand. Terrified. Baby stands with him, puts a hand on his shoulder:
C: BABY
D: Your Honor, I would like to move to dismiss all charges.
N: She turns to smile at Lester Sims, the D.A. and his dickhead client, Mr. Stanton.
C: BABY
D: Mr. Flores did not steal Mr. Stanton’s car. It’s stated in the police report that Mr. Stanton tossed his keys to Mr. Flores and told him to “Take it easy with her,” which suggests he wanted Carlos to take the car for a drive.
E: CONT'D
N: Lester stands. Oh, hell no. But Baby continues.
C: BABY
D: Mr. Stanton may argue that he thought Carlos was the valet. However, that argument has no merit, considering he’d met my client earlier that day and was informed that Carlos was not the valet. Therefore, one can only surmise that Mr. Stanton intended for Mr. Flores to take his car for a drive. A joyride, if you will.
E: CONT'D
N: The Judge smirks. She’s loving this.
C: BABY
D: The only thing Carlos Flores is guilty of is perhaps not taking it “easy” enough.
E: CONT'D
C: LESTER
D: Your Honor, this is ridiculous--
C: JUDGE
D: I’ll decide what’s ridiculous, Counselor. Charges dismissed.
N: She brings the GAVEL down.
C: JUDGE
D: And I suggest you park your own car from now on, Mr. Stanton.
E: CONT'D
N: Baby grins. She WON!

N: She laughs. The song ends. Jake sees them.
C: JAKE
D: Hey, look who’s here!
N: Baby takes it all in. It’s the same, but different. Lola is in heaven. Finally, they’re at the party!

C: LOLA
D: You know, this should be a thousand times embarrassing, but... that’s my MOM!

N: Camila pushes Jake down on the bed. Pulls his shirt off.
S: INT. NOAH’S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Baby shoves Noah against the wall. She is HUNGRY, and she’s making a meal of Noah. He’s totally fine with that. She unbuttons his shirt. Runs her hands over his muscled chest. Oh my GOD. His body, his skin. So firm. Suddenly:
C: BABY
D: Do you know how much older I am than you?
N: Noah pulls back enough to see her face. He stares down at her. Intense. Sincere.
C: NOAH

N: He picks her up, hands on her ass, and carries her to the bed. She pulls him down on top of her.
S: INT. LISA’S HOTEL ROOM
N: Lisa and Lola have raided the mini-bar. Their loot sits between them on the bed: chips, candy bars, cookies, nuts. Lola bites into a candy bar. She smirks.
C: LOLA
D: What do you think they’re doing?
N: Lola smirks. Lisa throws a potato chip at her.

C: JAKE
D: We can make another tape.
C: CAMILA
D: There’s no time. We’re working all weekend.
C: JAKE
D: Then we’ll dance at the wedding. They have to have entertainment, right? A live audition’s better than a tape, anyway.
C: CAMILA
D: They brought in the American Ballet Company and The Three Tenors. They don’t want to see me do the Samba.
E: laughs
N: She shrugs. Tears her eyes away from the lake, keeps walking. Jake follows behind her. Thinking.
S: INT. NOAH’S HOTEL ROOM - NEXT MORNING
N: Noah’s in front of the mirror, towel around his waist. Baby watches from the bed, the covers wrapped around her.
C: BABY
D: You are something to look at.
N: Her eyes trail down his body. He turns.
C: NOAH
D: Stop looking at me like that. I’ve got a wedding to run. Today’s the big day. I can’t be late.

S: INT. RECEPTION STAGE
N: ...onto the stage. He nods at Carlos to start the music. Carlos presses PLAY on the Boom Box. Fast Latin music flows. Jake stands tall. Perfect frame. Hold his arms out, in position. He sees Camila glance at Isabel. Camila shakes her head: No. Jake nods. YES. Everyone waits. It’s getting a little awkward when finally... Camila SPINS onto the stage and into Jake’s arms.

C: CAMILA
D: You can do anything.
