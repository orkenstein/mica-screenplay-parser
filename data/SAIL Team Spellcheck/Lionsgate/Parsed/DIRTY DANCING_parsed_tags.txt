0: 
N: CITY LIGHTS shine. The TWIN TOWERS stand tall. TRAFFIC jams
N: the streets. The night’s hot. Steam rises. Sweat drips as
N: PEOPLE jostle for space on crowded sidewalks.
0: 
N: Cabbies shout at pedestrians. MUSIC mingles with CAR HORNS...

S: INT. SUBWAY STATION - SAME TIME
0: 
N: ...as BUSKERS lay down a boiling beat. The cadence echoes off
N: the brick walls as a TRAIN pulls in, lending its squeaky
N: clickety-clack sound to the underground tunes.
0: 
N: Some TEENS dance to the pulse of the music, heated young
N: bodies riding the rhythm.
0: 
N: A few HOT GIRLS breeze through the platform. One drops a few
N: bills into the busker’s basket. They head toward the train...
0: 
N: ...and walk right past a YOUNG COUPLE leaning against a post.
N: The guy whispers into his girlfriend’s ear. She grins, pulls
N: his face to hers. As they make out...
0: 
0: 
S: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN
0: 
N: ...the TRAIN DOORS open. The Hot Girls hop on. Just before
N: the doors close, the Make-Out-Couple dart inside. The Guy
N: grabs an overhead strap, pulls his Girl close.
0: 
N: Next to them:
0: 
N: JAKE (19) grips a hand-strap. He’s broody. Scowly. Sexy as
N: hell. He glances down at a SEALED LETTER in his other hand.

S: EXT. LONG ISLAND - MIDNIGHT - FLASHBACK
0: 
N: An expansive ELEGANT HOME is being remodeled. The yard is
N: half-landscaped. A BACKHOE sits near a dirt mound.
0: 
N: The area’s littered with BEER CANS, BOTTLES, and Jake’s
N: FRIENDS. One climbs into the backhoe, says:
0: 
C:                     DRUNK FRIEND
D:           Dude. The keys are in here.
0: 
N: The Backhoe’s engine RUMBLE to life. The BUCKET judders up
N: and down. Jake laughs. Climbs onto the rig.

C:                     JAKE
D:           Get out of there, idiot.
0: 
N: The Drunk Friend hops out. Jake slides into the seat. He
N: yanks at the levers. His feet work the clutch and gas.
0: 
N: A puff of DUST rises as the backhoe starts to move. His
N: friends let out a raucous cheer.
0: 
N: The backhoe bucket-teeth punch through the dirt. Jake shifts
N: the lever and the bucket rises, dirt falling like snow.
0: 
C:                       JAKE (CONT'D)
D:           Where to?
0: 
N: A SEXY TEEN steps up to the backhoe. She smiles at Jake.
0: 
C:                       SEXY TEEN
D:           The pool.
0: 
N: A pristine, crystal-blue swimming pool glitters in the
N: moonlight. More cheers. Jake grins.

C:                     JAKE
D:           The pool. You got it.

S: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - END FLASHBACK
0: 
N: The train STOPS. Make-Out-Girl stumbles, bumps into Jake.
N: Whoops! Her Guy pulls her back to him. The doors OPEN.
0: 
N: The Hot Girls eye him. Yummy. Jake grins. Not half bad.
0: 
N: The train stops. The Hot Girls get off. One looks back at
N: him. Smiles. Maybe he’ll go talk to her. But... the letter.
0: 
N: The doors close. Oh, well. The train LURCHES forward.

S: EXT. LONG ISLAND ELEGANT HOME - FLASHBACK
0: 
N: BLUE LIGHTS strobe on top of a POLICE CRUISER. A few of the
N: friends, the ones who didn’t run, loiter near the backhoe...
0: 
N: ...which has been driven through the wall of the house.
0: 
N: The cops approach, flashlights shining over the damage.
0: 
N: Then the flashlights find Jake, sitting on a mound of dirt.
N: Drinking a beer. Not a care in the world.

N: Jake walks past THE LINCOLN CENTER. A group of DANCERS come
N: out, still in rehearsal gear. They hurry down the stairs.
0:

D:           I, uh, I’ve got this letter for...

D:           You are not going to believe this.
0: 
N: A woman turns. It’s BABY (50s). Time has been good to her.

C:                     LISA (CONT'D)
D:           This is Jake Castle. Johnny’s son.

0: 
C:                     BABY
D:           I don’t believe it. Johnny’s son?

D:           Spitting image, right? Jake, this
D:           is my sister, Frances Houseman.
0: 
N: Ah, okay. Jake holds up the letter.
0: 0:                                                            4.

D:           I have this for you. From my dad.
0: 
N: Baby takes the letter. Grins even wider. The guests are
N: intrigued by this new bit of excitement. They all watch.
0: 
N: LOLA (13), Baby’s daughter, joins her mom.
0: 
C:                     LOLA
D:           Who’s Johnny Castle?
0: 
N: She starts to open the envelope.
0: 
C:                     BABY
D:           Is he here? In the city?
0: 
N: She lifts the flap of the envelope and Jake realizes...
0: 
C:                     JAKE
D:           You don’t know, do you?
0: 
N: Baby stops opening, looks up. Know what? Jake hesitates for a
N: brief moment. Then:
0: 
C:                     JAKE (CONT'D)
D:           My dad died. Six years ago. It was
D:           cancer. I just found that letter
D:           and wanted to know who you were,
D:           and how you knew my dad.
0: 
C:                     BABY
D:           I don’t-- wait, he... what? No. No.
0: 
N: DANIEL (50s), Lola’s dad, puts a hand on Baby’s back.
0: 
C:                       DANIEL
D:           Francie--
0: 
N: Baby steps sharply away from him. Daniel looks to Lisa. Help?
0: 
C:                     LISA
D:           Okay, everyone. Johnny... Castle.
0: 
N: Lisa takes center stage, keeping the attention off Baby.
0: 
C:                     LISA (CONT'D)
D:           Johnny was the love of Baby’s
D:           teenage life. It was the summer we
D:           spent at Kellerman’s, that place up
D:           in the Catskills...
0: 
N: Baby gives her a pleading look. Please don’t. So Lisa pivots.

C:                     LISA (CONT'D)
D:           Um, well, you all know me. I was
D:           nineteen and determined to find a
D:           husband.
0: 
C:                     GUEST
D:           Just the one, Lisa?
0: 
N: Everyone laughs. Everyone except Jake and Baby. He hasn’t
N: taken his eyes off Baby. She looks pretty broken up.
0: 
C:                     LISA
D:           So I chased this waiter around all
D:           summer. Robbie. But he turned out
D:           to be a real asshole--
0: 
C:                     JAKE
D:           What about my dad?
0: 
C:                     LOLA
D:           Yeah. Tell us about Johnny.
0: 
N: Uhhh... Lisa looks to Baby. Baby forces a smile. Jake watches
N: her closely. So does Daniel.
0: 
C:                     BABY
D:           Johnny was...
0: 
N: She doesn’t cry, but she can’t speak, either.
0: 
C:                     LISA
D:           Johnny was a dance instructor.
0: 
C:                     JAKE
D:           A what? No. My dad was a house
D:           painter.
0: 
C:                     LISA
D:           When we knew him, he was a dance
D:           instructor.
0: 
N: This is news to Jake. The fuck?
0: 
C:                     LOLA
E:               (whispers to Baby)
D:           You got it on with the dance
D:           instructor? Mom, that’s kinda hot.
0: 
N: Baby shakes her head. Trying to process... everything.
0: 
N: Lisa still holds court -- but now she’s carried away. The
N: guests hang on her every word:

C:                     LISA
D:           He was so good. So was Baby. They
D:           were like magnets. You couldn’t
D:           keep them apart. Our parents found
D:           out and lost their minds. Johnny
D:           got fired. But he showed up to the
D:           summer showcase anyway. He grabbed
D:           Baby and they did this dance number
D:           that blew everyone away. Even Dad.
D:           Nobody puts Baby in a corner--
0: 
C:                     BABY
D:           Yep. And that was the big finish.
0: 
N: She stands abruptly, a trembling smile pasted to her face.
N: Daniel steps closer to her.
0: 
C:                     DANIEL
D:           How did I not know any of this?
0: 
C:                     BABY
D:           Because it was before you. Okay?
0: 
N: Okay. Daniel backs off. Baby goes to Jake.
0: 
C:                     BABY (CONT'D)
D:           I’m-- I didn’t know. I’m so sorry.
0: 
N: The tears threaten again. Jake looks around at the guests.
N: The mood has gone from jovial to awkward.
0: 
C:                     JAKE
D:           No, look, I shouldn’t have busted

D:           I’m... can I get your phone number?
D:           I’d like to talk more, but...
0: 
N: She glances back at the guests.
0: 
C:                     JAKE

C:                     LISA (CONT'D)
D:           I love you.

C:                     DANIEL
D:           You want to talk about it? I can

D:           Joyriding. He’s a kid, with no
D:           priors. He didn’t steal the car
D:           with the intent to--

D:           Mr. Flores did not steal Mr.
D:           Stanton’s car. It’s stated in the
D:           police report that Mr. Stanton
D:           tossed his keys to Mr. Flores and
D:           told him to “Take it easy with
D:           her,” which suggests he wanted
D:           Carlos to take the car for a drive.

D:           Mr. Stanton may argue that he
D:           thought Carlos was the valet.
D:           However, that argument has no
D:           merit, considering he’d met my
D:           client earlier that day and was
D:           informed that Carlos was not the
D:           valet. Therefore, one can only
D:           surmise that Mr. Stanton intended
D:           for Mr. Flores to take his car for
D:           a drive. A joyride, if you will.
