N:                It's been a little over a year since Dante ran away from La
N:                Rotunda.
N:                In a small Mexican village lost in the middle of nowhere, a
N:                man cuts wood in the tranquility of a cold afternoon.
N:                Beyond, a warm cabin, a jeep parked on the side and more
N:                trees.

N:                After several cut logs we reveal that the man is DANTE. It
N:                looks different to hide its identity (with grown beard and
N:                hair).

N:                When he finishes his homework, he throws the axe into a log

N:                throws them into the fire of the house already lit. Sitting
N:                at the table is FRIDA, who, we understand, is Dante 's
N:                couple and helps PABLITO, Dante 's son with school chores.
N:                The boy snorts bored.

D:             Frida doesn't stop and keeps running, carrying Pablito. The
D:             agent is about to pull the trigger when Dante suddenly shows
D:             up and attacks him in the back. They fight and the agent ends
D:             up shooting into the sky. Frida and Pablito arrive at the
D:             jeep and Frida turns it on.
D:             The boss hits Dante on the head, he responds, and the two
D:             roll to the ground wrestling. The agent seeks to get his gun
D:             back, while Dante looks for something to defend himself. On
D:             the side is the axe we saw him use, during the afternoon, to

N:             lost. His gaze and Dante's are intersecting. But Dante,
N:             instead of finishing off, hits him with the handle of the

D:             stabilize it. It breaks a few inches from crashing into the

N:             through the courtyard as the owners of the place. Beyond
N:             that, Pedro, Rodrigo and other young prisoners play a
N:             basketball game . The ball hits the hoop and comes to
N:             Dante.
