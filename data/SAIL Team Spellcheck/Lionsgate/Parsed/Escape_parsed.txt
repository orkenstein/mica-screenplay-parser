M: NOTE TO THE READER:
N: All the action will be played in as WIDE SHOTS as possible with as FEW CUTS as possible. It will feel like a Jackie Chan/Buster Keaton-style stunt extravaganza. Editing will never be used to hide the faces of the performers, bridge gaps in the choreography, or reconcile inconsistent blocking. It will feel like it is all being played out in real life by real performers interacting with real objects in real spaces. ALSO: Please forgive the extremely long description of two buildings you’re about to read, but we’re going to spend a lot of time with them, so we promise it’s worthwhile.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DUSK
N: We see the sun setting, sinking behind an EMPTY and ABANDONED industrial area on the outskirts of Downtown LA. TWO TOWERING BUILDINGS facing one another, a narrow street running between them, the HOLLYWOOD SIGN in the deep background. TITLE UP: 7:00PM To the left is a concrete goliath from the 50’s. It’s 25 stories of once stunning brutalist modern architecture, now aged. A un-illuminated RED NEON SIGN that reads THE WILSHIRE crawls down the side of the building. There’s a sign in front of The Wilshire that features a rendering of TWO NEW ULTRA CONTEMPORARY apartment buildings with the words “COMING SOON!”. DIRECTLY ACROSS the street stands one of the BRAND NEW ULTRA CONTEMPORARY apartment buildings from the rendering. Above the lobby a sign reads THE GALLERIA. A LARGE BANNER hangs from The Wilshire to The Galleria: “NOW LEASING”. The Galleria is twice as tall as The Wilshire, with sleek glass, steel, concrete, POPS of brightly colored accents and LED screens throughout. It’s part apartment building, part high end mall, filled with luxury stores and fancy restaurants. The building is unoccupied, though many rooms are already furnished. About 20% of it is still being built. A huge CONSTRUCTION YARD surrounds the back of the building. Half way up a crane is mounted to the side of the building. Workers leave both buildings for the night. THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS towards The Wilshire and starts moving UP and alongside it’s exterior. As we rise we catch glimpses of the building’s interior. The apartments are OLD, DECREPIT, and EMPTY. Some of them are already stripped down, as the building is being prepped for demolition. We rise to the 20th floor, push towards the building, and enter...
S: INT. THE WILSHIRE - 20TH FLOOR - COLE’S APARTMENT -
N: CONTINUOUS We see an sparse and rundown apartment filled with boxes. We TRACK BACK through it and find COLE, a clean and put together guy in his late-thirties, standing in front of a brand new record player. He drops the needle onto a spinning vinyl and turns up the volume: MUSIC UP: WHOLE LOTTA LOVE by LED ZEPPELIN - We see Cole opening a series of delivery boxes. Cleaning products, kitchen supplies, little Ikea rugs, etc. He’s clearly just moving into this place. - He starts CLEANING RIGOROUSLY, on his hands and knees, scrubbing the floor as best he can. He has a DETERMINED look on his face. - He VACUUMS every surface, including the curtains. - As he WIPES down the counters over and over, trying to make them spotless, we see some JOB APPLICATIONS with his name: COLEMAN MARKOWITZ. There’s also some PAROLE paperwork in the stack. He puts the papers in a drawer, clearing the clutter. - He sees a RAT with black body and white head run by, and grabs a PAN! He CHASES it into the corner and RAISES the pan, about to smash it; but then the right looks right at him. Beat.
C: COLE
D: Fuck it. Go little rat. Go.
N: The rat RUNS off and squirms through a crack in the wall. Cole keeps cleaning. - He PAINSTAKINGLY assembles a SHELF from Ikea. - Cole uses a LASER LEVEL to hang the SHELF on the wall. He puts some COOKBOOKS, a MUG, and some other stuff on it. - He lays a CUTTING BOARD on the counter and then places a puts a big knife on it, almost staging the space to look nice. - Exhausted, he assess the room. All things considered, it looks pretty good.
C: COLE
D: Not bad...
E: CONT'D
N: He SNAPS a picture on his phone, pleased with his hard work. Then, he nervously goes through his contacts and pulls up WIFEY. He is about to dial, hesitates for a moment, then presses the button. It goes STRAIGHT TO THE VOICEMAIL. Cole gets a TEXT: WIFEY: I’d rather text than talk to you on the phone. This upsets Cole, but he pushes forward and TEXTS her: COLE: Hey. I just haven’t heard from you in a couple days. I was just checking in to see if you thought more about maybe seeing me again? Giving me another chance? You could swing by We could talk in person? Cole anxiously awaits a response: WIFEY: I’m not sure. It’s not the answer Cole was hoping for, but he keeps on: COLE: I’d love to see you. It’s been like six months. I know things ended badly between us. I get why you didn’t see me while I was locked up, but now that I’m out, I’d love to see you again. WIFEY: ... He waits to see what she’s typing, but nothing appears. COLE: I just want you to know I’m ready. I’ve got my life back on track. I’ve got a new place. A new job. It’s a whole new me. Check it out! He sends the PICTURE of his apartment. He sees her response: WIFEY: This new job isn’t anything like your old job? Cole quickly types back: COLE: Of course not! I’ve completely changed! I’m the caretaker of this building as they prep it for demolition. It’s a big responsibility. I make sure nobody’s here who’s not supposed to be. It’s like, a legit job. WIFEY: So you’re responsible now? COLE: Super responsible! I got a fire extinguisher, like you were always telling me we should have. First thing I got when I moved in. He TAKES A PIC of his FIRE EXTINGUISHER and sends it to her. WIFEY: I bet you still can’t even keep your phone charged. Cole looks. It’s at 4%. He doesn’t know how to respond.
C: COLE
D: Hmmm...
E: CONT'D
N: WIFEY: I don’t think I can trust you again. You lied to me for five years. COLE: I lied about one thing. Everything else about me was real. WIFEY: BEING A CAR THIEF AND LYING ABOUT IT IS A PRETTY BIG THING! Cole doesn’t know what to say. He thinks hard, then responds: COLE: I know I lied to you, and I’ll always regret it, and I’ve learned my lesson. You know me better than anyone in the world. You get who I am. And you’ve helped make me a better person. The type of person you deserve. Please. Can we just talk on the phone? ACROSS THE STREET, on the same floor as Cole (20th), we see a light get FLIPPED on in an apartment. It gets Cole’s attention, as it’s the only apartment that appears to be occupied in the entire building. He watches A WOMAN enter the pre-furnished apartment, rolling in a large piece of LOUIS VUITTON LUGGAGE and a LOUIS VITTON PURSE slung over her shoulder. He takes out a PINK PIECE OF PAPER and texts the number on it. COLE: Yo Zac. There’s some lady in The Galleria FYI. Then another text appears from Wifey. WIFEY: I know you want to be ready, but I just don’t think you are. Cole hangs his head, devastated. He debates typing more, but decides against it. He puts the cell back in his pocket and let’s out a defeated sigh. He’s so focused on his own sadness that he remains completely unaware as BEHIND HIM and ACROSS THE STREET the woman’s apartment door is KICKED OPEN and 20 HEAVILY ARMED THUGS RUSH IN!!! The woman, sitting in a chair, seems caught off guard and frozen in fear. The MAIN THUG, dressed in an CRISP WHITE SUIT that already has a splatter of blood on it, steps forward and brutally PUNCHES HER in the HEAD! Cole, still completely oblivious, grabs a beer and an UNCOOKED STEAK from the fridge. He FLIPS on the stove, pours some oil in a pan and tosses the steak on. He CHUGS his beer, drowning his sorrows. Behind him, the main thug starts interrogating the woman, PUNCHING her AGAIN and AGAIN. Cole sips his beer again, slowly and sadly, still utterly oblivious. The thugs CONTINUES to beat the woman and then VIOLENTLY ties her to a chair. Cole starts to quietly WEEP to himself. He shakes his head, then CHUGS the rest of his beer. He walks over to his freezer where there’s a full bottle of Vodka. Cole takes a HUGE SWIG as, behind him, we see the THUGS in the background yelling at the woman as they point GUNS at her! Cole pulls a JOINT out of his SHIRT POCKET and starts taking BIG, ANGRY HITS as he tries to get fucked up enough to forget his woes. He sucks down the joint in no time, then TOSSES the roach across the room, landing it directly in the sink. He takes ANOTHER SWIG of VODKA and puts the bottle back in the freezer. HE looks over to his STEAK, still sizzling in the pan. He goes over, when he FINALLY sees what’s happening across the street: over a dozen ARMED THUGS with guns AIMED at a HELPLESS WOMAN tied to a chair!
C: COLE
D: Oh shit!
E: CONT'D
N: He throws his arms up in shock, TOSSING his beer can across the room. He watches in horror as the main thug PUTS HIS GUN AGAINST THE WOMAN’S HEAD!
C: COLE
D: No! No, no, no!
E: CONT'D
N: He SCRAMBLES for something to do, and sees the LASER LEVEL beside him. He picks it up and SHOOTS IT ACROSS THE STREET in an attempt to distract the killers; it’s RED LASER DOT appears in the centre of the gun-weilding thugs chest. The thug notices it and motions for everyone to find COVER. They scatter, then trace the laser back to it’s source, which leads all the thugs to look directly at COLE!
C: COLE
D: OH FUCK.
E: CONT'D
N: Cole DUCKS down. He thinks for a moment, then scrambles to pull out his cell. He starts to unlock it, when the BATTERY RUNS OUT and the phone SHUTS OFF. Cole starts to panic. His eyes dart around the room. He sees a CORD plugged into the wall and, staying close to the ground, scampers towards it. He tries to plug his phone into it, but it’s an iPad 11 Pro plug, not an iPhone 11 Pro plug.
C: COLE
D: FUCKING APPLE!!! HOW MANY DIFFERENT PLUGS DO YOU NEED?!
E: CONT'D
N: He crawls towards the window and cautiously PEEKS his head up: he sees the thugs have all taken cover and the MAIN THUG is motioning for TWO TACTICAL LOOKING THUGS to go TO COLE’S APARTMENT! Cole YANKS the curtains shut. He PANICS. He GETS UP and moves away from the window, tearing open drawers. FINALLY, he finds a drawer FILLED with different cords.
C: COLE
D: Oh goddamit! So many cords!
E: CONT'D
N: He find the right type of cord and desperately starts to untangle it from the messy bundle. He frees it, then realizes it’s JUST the cord, as in there’s no CUBE that actually let’s you plug it into an outlet!
C: COLE
D: Fucking charging cube!
E: CONT'D
N: He cautiously goes back to the window and peeks out. There’s now SEVEN thugs in the room with the woman. The others must have scattered. He looks DOWN TO THE STREET and sees the TWO TACTICAL THUGS leaving The Galleria... and coming across the street to COLE’S BUILDING!
C: COLE
D: OH FUCK ME!
E: CONT'D
N: COLE FREAKS OUT, digging faster until he finally finds a cube to plug the wire into.
C: COLE
D: Come on... motherfucker...
E: CONT'D fumbling with the cord
N: He immediately plugs his phone into the nearest outlet. The CHARGING icon comes on, and he realizes it’s going to take a couple minutes for the phone to come back to life.
C: COLE
D: Oh what the fucking fuck.
E: CONT'D
N: Cole leaves the phone plugged in and RUNS over to his front door. He opens the door looks down the hall, and sees the ELEVATOR has left the lobby and is COME UP!
C: COLE
D: SHIT!
E: CONT'D
N: Cole DUCKS BACK into his apartment. He looks around for somewhere to hide. There’s no good options. He runs BACK to his front door to see if he can make it to the stairs. He looks down the LONG HALL to the staircase, than BACK to the elevator. It’s on the 14th FLOOR, 15th FLOOR, 16th FLOOR!!! Cole makes a mad DASH for the STAIRCASE, but when he’s about a third of the way there, he hears the *BING* of the elevator.
C: COLE
D: Dammit!
E: CONT'D
N: He’ll never make it to the stairs. He TURNS AROUND and RUNS BACK to his apartment. The elevator doors start to open.
C: COLE
D: Hey! Yo! Look! I’m-
E: CONT'D
N: PHOOM! A GAS CANISTER is LAUNCHED from inside the elevator, NAILING Cole in the stomach.
C: COLE
D: Ah!!
E: CONT'D
N: GAS SHOOTS EVERYWHERE as one of the tactical thugs named ANIMAL bursts from the elevator and CHARGES towards Cole! Cole, COUGHING AND GAGGING, jumps back into his apartment and closes the door behind him.
S: INT. THE WILSHIRE - COLE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole runs in, panicking as he despseratly GASPS for air. He looks for somewhere to hide, when Animal KICKS open the the door. He RAISES his gun as he steps fowards to make the kill shot, but SLIPS on the BEER that Cole spilled earlier. He SLAMS to the ground and LOSES his gun, which SLIDES under the fridge. Cole, still coughing, tries to RUN out the door but Animal GRABS his LEG and THROWS HIM towards the kitchen.
C: COLE
D: Please! I’m...look...I’m-
E: through coughs
N: Animal approaches; he’s clearly not going to listen to anything. Cole GRABS his new FIRE EXTINGUISHER and HITS Animal in the face with it, KNOCKING OUT a few of his TEETH. Animal is PISSED.
C: COLE
D: I’m sorry! Listen-
E: CONT'D
N: Animal SWINGS at Cole, who raises up the fire extinguisher to block the blow. Animal’s FIST collides with the top of the fire extinguisher, causing it to SNAP off. Compressed gas ROCKETS out of the extinguisher, sending it SOARING out of Cole’s hands, ricochetting off a wall, and FLYING OUT THE WINDOW! Cole is shocked, but Animal doesn’t miss a beat. He GRABS a KNIFE off of the kitchen counter and THRUSTS it at Cole. Cole grabs a big bottle of OLIVE OIL and BLOCKS the knife. It PUNCTURES the bottle and oil SPURTS into Animal’s seyes.
C: ANIMAL
D: AHHH!!
N: Animal BLINDLY LUNGES with the knife again. Cole grabs a little GARBAGE BIN and puts it over the knife in Animal’s hand. Animal FLINGS the bin off his hand and WHIPS the KNIFE at Cole, who HOLDS UP A CUTTING BOARD. It STICKS in the board. A thankful Cole tosses them both aside and onto a nearby counter. Animal PUNCHES Cole, who stumbles back towards the fridge. Cole SWINGS OPEN the FREEZER DOOR, trying to hit Animal in the face with it, but Animal just GRABS IT, RIPS IT OFF ITS HINGES, and WHACKS Cole over the head with it. Cole stumbles back and turns to run, but Animal HURLS the FREEZER DOOR like a giant frisbee, NAILING Cole in the back. Cole falls, the door landing right beside him. Animal reaches into the FREEZER and pulls out the BOTTLE OF VODKA. He HURLS it at Cole, and it NAILS him in the head, but doesn’t break. Animal looks and the fridge is FULL of vodka bottles. He HURLS another one, but Cole grabs the FREEZER DOOR and uses it as a shield. SMASH! The bottle shatters. Animal grabs a another bottle, breaks it, and advances with the jagged half-broken bottle. Cole spots a BOX OF BAKING SODA in the FREEZER DOOR and HURLS IT at Animal, hitting him in the face and temporarily BLINDING him. A terrified Cole starts running in a big circle around his apartment as Animal chases him.
C: COLE
D: Look, please stop! Just listen!
C: ANIMAL
D: Okay. I’ll stop, let’s talk.
C: COLE
D: I’m-
N: Animal PUNCHES Cole.
C: ANIMAL
D: Stupid motherfucker!
N: Animal punches him again. Cole starts running again, and Animal chasing. Cole spots the frying pan on the stove with the steak in olive oil. He runs past it, flipping on the element. He makes another lap of the apartment. Animal is hot on his tail. Animal and Cole face off on opposite sides of the KITCHEN ISLAND. Cole inches one way, Animal follows. He inches the other way, and Animal matches him. It’s a stand off. Cole is incredibly OUT OF BREATH. Animal isn’t, which makes him smile. Cole quickly grabs a cup of water and HURLS it at the PAN. It sends FLAMING OIL SPLASHING ALL OVER ANIMAL, ENGULFING him in FLAMES!!!
C: ANIMAL
D: AHHHHHH!!! FUCK!! PUT ME OUT!! PUT ME OUT!
E: CONT'D
N: Animal ROLLS around on the ground. Cole watches in horror.
C: COLE
D: I can’t! You launched my fire extinguisher out the window!
C: ANIMAL
D: AHHHHHHHH!! PLEASE!!! IT HURTS!!!!
N: Cole runs to his couch and grabs a throw blanket. HE SMOTHERS out the flames on Animal.
C: COLE
D: It’s okay! I got you!
N: The flames finally go out and Cole watches as Animal PASSES OUT from the pain.
C: COLE
D: I’m so sorry, dude. Feel better.
E: CONT'D
N: Cole RUNS towards the door of his apartment. He stops, looks back and sees his PHONE, plugged in to the wall near Animal, who is now lying motionless on the ground, seemingly passed out from the pain. Cole goes over to Grab it when Animal SPRINGS to his feet and GRABS Cole by the throat, RAGE IN HIS EYES.
C: ANIMAL
D: YOU FUCK!
N: HE HOISTS HIM UP and SLAMS him against the wall, choking him. Cole’s eyes start to roll back. He desperately looks for something to help him. He grabs a MUG off the shelf above him, and WHACKS Animal with it. It does nothing. He grabs a COOKBOOK off the shelf and WHACKS Animal with it. It just makes him madder. Cole’s going dark. Then... he sees the CUTTING BOARD WITH THE KNIFE STICKING OUT OF IT on the counter behind Animal. Cole lobs the COOKBOOK. It CLIPS the edge of the CUTTING BOARD, which FLIPS it off the counter, and CATAPULTS the knife into ANIMAL’S SHOULDER!
C: ANIMAL
D: AHHH!!!!!
E: CONT'D
N: Animal stumbles back, SLIPS on a pool of OLIVE OIL and SHATTERED GLASS, and FALLS towards Cole’s window. CRASH!!! He FALLS OUT THE WINDOW! Cole RUNS to the window and LOOKS down.
C: ANIMAL
D: AHHHHHHHHHH-
E: CONT'D
N: SPLAT! Animal SLAMS against the pavement. Dead. Cole is horrified. He looks across the street and SEES the thugs, a few stories below, in a DARK ROOM, LOOKING UP to Cole in the window. They motion to each other and MORE THUGS are clearly sent to kill Cole! Cole grabs his CELL and CHARGER, then RUNS out the door.
S: INT. THE WILSHIRE - 20TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole BARRELS into the hall and RUSHES towards the elevator. He’s about to hit the down button, when he sees it’s already on it’s way UP!!! With no other option the exhausted Cole SPRINTS to the stairwell. *BING* The elevator arrives. Cole OPENS the door to the STAIRWELL and dashes in just as the other tactical thug, HAWK, steps out of the elevator.
S: INT. THE WILSHIRE - 20TH FLOOR - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole, completely out of breathe, leans against the wall, exhausted. He pulls out his cell and rushes to his contact, when it suddenly DIES AGAIN.
C: COLE
D: Come on!
E: to himself
N: Cole PEEKS through a small window in the door and sees Hawk enter Cole’s apartment.
C: HAWK
D: Animal?! I checked the lobby, where are you- NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
E: O.S. beat
N: Hawk BURSTS into the hallway and takes off his MASK and we see his looks EXACTLY LIKE ANIMAL. They were twins!
C: HAWK
D: Animal... he fucking killed you. He fucking killed mybrother.
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: Fuck... twins!
E: to himself
N: Hawk LOOKS towards the STAIRWELL, murder in his eyes, and angrily RUSHES towards it. Cole, terrified, looks DOWN the stairwell and sees the stairs are in the midst of being STRIPPED and REMOVED. There’s no stairs left to go down, so he runs UP TWO FLIGHTS and exits onto another floor.
S: INT. THE WILSHIRE - 22ND FLOOR - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole runs down the hallway. This floor is being prepped for destruction. Lots of the walls have been torn down to their studs. Cole stops for a moment to catch his breath, when he notices, across the room, an EXTENSION CORD peeking out from around a corner. He looks down to his phone and charger, and then starts moving across the room towards the extension cord, when *BING*. The elevator arrives. Cole JUMPS behind HALF A WALL just as the doors open, revealing Hawk. He steps out, furiously hunting for Cole. Cole waits till Hawk storms off down another hall, then continues his way to the cord he saw. He plugs in his cell and looks at the screen. Nothing. He follows the cord into the next room.
S: INT. THE WILSHIRE - TWO LEVEL INDUSTRIAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole, quietly goes through a doorway and onto the small landing at the top of a steel staircase in a two level industrial area. Cole finds the end of a VERY LONG extension behind the door, the other end is plugged into an outlet on a nearby wall. He looks at his phone. Nothing. The outlet isn’t active.
C: COLE
D: Fuck.
N: HE HEARS HAWK kicking in doors as he makes he way through the floor. Cole notices a FUSE BOX on the wall. He opens it, but all the labels for the fuses have long faded. He SWITCHES one ON. Suddenly, the song BLUE by EFFIEL 95 starts playing somewhere nearbye.
C: RADIO
D: I’m blue, bah dah dee-
E: O.S.
N: Cole looks down a hall and sees that it’s coming from a RADIO sitting on some SCAFFOLDING outside a distant window. He quickly switches the breaker off. Cole flips another breaker. The sign outside the building that reads THE WILSHIRE comes to life! BRIGHT NEON RED LIGHT floods in through the windows. He turns on a third breaker, waiting for the worst. NOTHING. He looks down on this phone and, although it hasn’t come back to life yet, the CHARGING icon comes on. COLE PUMPS HIS FIST.
C: COLE
D: Yes!
E: whispering
N: Cole ANXIOUSLY waits for his phone to come back on, when... THE EXTENSION CORD IS WRAPPED AROUND HIS NECK and HAWK starts CHOKING Cole from behind!
C: HAWK
D: Gotcha!!
N: Cole WILDLY STRUGGLES, but holds his phone tight, and quickly ends up with a length of the cord wrapped around his body. Amidst the struggle Hawk doesn’t notice he has stepped in a large tangled pile of the SAME CORD. BING! An ELEVATOR arrives in the landing area below them and another thug, BALKI, emerges. He sees the TWO MEN STRUGGLING and PULLS HIS GUN. He aims. We see his POV. With the two men struggling upside down, it’s no easy shot.
C: BALKI
D: I got him.
C: COLE
D: No! You don’t!!!
C: BALKI
D: Yeah. I do.
E: beat
N: BANG! He GRAZES both Hawk and Cole.
C: HAWK COLE
D: FUCK! SHIT!
C: BALKI
D: Shit! I’m comin’ up!
N: He re-holsters his gun and RUNS up the stairs to help Hawk. As Hawk continues to choke Cole, he notices the PHONE he’s clutching and RIPS it out of his hand, then TOSSES it into the SERVICE ELEVATOR.
C: COLE
D: Nooo!
E: being choked
N: Cole KICKS off the wall, slamming Hawk against the railing. Hawk loses his balance and drops the cord. Cole SHOVES him, and Hawk falls over the railing.
C: HAWK
D: AHH!!!
N: Balki gets to the top of the stairs and SHOOTS AT COLE, but Cole is suddenly YANKED over the railing and the BULLET MISSES! We see the other end of the extension cord has wrapped around Hawk’s leg and pulled Cole over the edge with him! They both PLUMMET towards the floor, but the CORD pulls TAUGHT right before they hit the floor. Cole is suspended by his shoulders and right next to him Hawk is upside down, suspended by his feet. Balki aims DOWN at Cole but can’t get a clear shot.
C: BALKI
D: I got it this time!
C: HAWK
D: No! Not again!
C: BALKI
D: Fuck! Fine!
N: He starts running BACK DOWN THE STAIRS. Cole notices his cell IN THE ELEVATOR. The doors start closing. Cole GRABS Hawk’s shoe off and THROWS it, hitting the elevator call button, causing the doors to OPEN AGAIN. Balki runs up and TACKLES Cole to the ground. This causes the cord to YANK Hawk UP towards the railing they’re hanging from. Hawk GRABS the railing, HOLDING ON as he tries to untangle his foot. MEANWHILE, below, Balki and Cole thrash on the ground. They ROLL back UNDER the landing. Balki PULLS his GUN from its holster and points it at Cole’s head.
C: BALKI
D: Haha!!!
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: No- plea-
E: wheezing unintelligibly from being choked
N: ABOVE THEM, Hawk LEANS onto the railing for balance as he tries to untangle his foot, when suddenly, the RAILING BREAKS! Hawk FALLS over the edge and lands on Cole and Balki. Hawk and Balki hit the ground HARD and are knocked UNCONSCIOUS. And then... the elevator doors start to close again. Cole, woozy, GRABS a broken piece of the railing and THROWS it at the button, but this time, he misses. The doors CLOSE and the elevator, with Cole’s phone in it, starts to ASCEND. All three of them, tangled up in the cord together, start to get DRAGGED towards the elevator. Cole tries to free himself but he can’t. THEY REACH the elevator doors and the CORD keeps pulling them and starts to CHOKE Cole. Cole grabs the SHOE he threw earlier and starts to REACH for the button, when Hawk and Balki start to come to. Cole PICKS UP the broken piece of RAILING he threw earlier and starts HITTING them with it. He tries to knock them out again while DESPERATELY trying to hit the elevator button with the SHOE in his other hand.
C: LUCA KORESH
D: Ow!! Fuck! Stop!!
N: He manages to HIT THE DOWN BUTTON and the elevator starts to RETURN! The tension is eased, and Cole catches his breath. BING! He wriggles free as the elevator doors open, revealing a huge rough looking guy covered in tattoos with a cold look in his eyes, and a HUGE MACHETE tucked in to his belt. We meet DUX (as in Put up your Dux) He reaches for the MACHETE. Cole THROWS the piece of railing at Dux, nailing him in the face.
C: DUX
D: AAH! FUCK
N: Dux DROPS his MACHETE, and it lands in Cole’s LEG!
C: COLE
D: AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
N: He YANKS it out and BLOOD SPURTS!
C: COLE
D: AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
E: CONT'D
N: Cole GRABS his PHONE and CHARGER, which are still plugged in to the LONG EXTENSION CORD, and RUNS!
S: INT. THE WILSHIRE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole ROUNDS a corner, bleeding badly from his leg, still WHEEZING from being choked. He has his phone in his hand and is trailing both blood and a long extension cord. He hears the thugs coming and DUCKS into an ABANANDONED APARTMENT.
S: INT. THE WILSHIRE - 21ST FLOOR - ABANDONED APARTMENT -
N: MOMENTS LATER Cole enters the DARK and ABANDONED apartment that’s been stripped for demolition. The FLOORBOARDS are decrepit and TEETER precariously on their support beams. He CLOSES the door behind him, and starts to take a deep breath, when his phone is YANKED from his hand! The pursuing thugs must be pulling it! He LEAPS and GRABS it just before it goes under the door. He YANKS IT BACK and WRAPS it around a SUPPORT BEAM. THE YANKING continues. Cole SHOVES over a HUGE BOOKCASE in front of the door, blocking it. It CRASHES down, CRACKING through floorboards and indenting into the floor. BANG! BANG! He HEARS the thugs try to kick open the door from the other side.
C: HAWK
D: Open up, motherfucker!!!!
N: Cole, neck still injured and wheezing, tries to yell back.
C: COLE
D: Please- You don’t-
E: coughing
N: He COUGHS up some blood. He can’t WHEEZ out any more words. He looks down at his BLEEDING LEG, then to his phone which is STILL CHARGING. A few pieces of door SPLINTER off as the THUGS continuously KICK at it. He goes over to the window, almost falling through the rickety floorboards as he does. The “NOW LEASING” banner that hangs between the building is drilled into the wall beside the window. Cole looks at the banner and realizes he has no choice but to try and shimmy along it to the other building. He hesitantly starts climbing out the window, readies his resolve and... ... HE CAN’T DO IT. It’s just TOO SCARY. He ducks back inside the building.
C: HAWK
D: You’re dead, whoever you are! You killed my twin brother! A part of me died tonight!!!!! I felt him die! We had a special twin bond! That shit’s real!!
E: O.S. yelling
C: COLE
D: I’m... sorry...
E: wheezing too softly to be heard
N: Cole doesn’t know what to do. His phone is still charging, his LEG is BLEEDING BADLY, and the thugs have almost broken through. He sees a tool kit and opens it. There’s stuff like caulking, a can of foam insulation spray, duct tape and WD40, but no hammers, screwdrivers or anything that could be a weapon. The DOOR is moments away from being kicked in!
C: HAWK
D: It doesn’t matter if you call the cops now! They won’t be here in time! You’re gonna fucking die!
E: O.S. yelling
N: Cole has no options. He sits in the corner, watching as the door is KICKED open from the outside. He accepts he probably is gonna die.
C: COLE
D: Fuck...
N: He closes his eyes and leans his head back, tears streaming down his face. THEN - HIS PHONE STARTS RINGING! It’s finally come to life! And he’s getting a call - from WIFEY. There’s LOUD banging, but he answers anyway.
C: COLE
D: Hello?
E: CONT'D barely able to talk still
N: He MUTES his end of the phone. WE HEAR his WIFE.
C: WIFEY
D: Hey Cole... uh... look... I’ve been thinking and...
E: O.S. MORE
C: WIFEY
D: it sounds like you’ve really turned a corner, and... people can change, so, yeah. Let’s grab a cup of coffee, in the next couple days or something. Does that sound good to you?
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: Cole can’t believe it. Even though this is clearly the most perilous moment of his life, a HUGE smile comes across his face. Tears of JOY stream down. The THUGS are still KICKING the door, but Cole UNMUTES between kicks for just enough time to wheez out-
C: COLE
D: Sounds good.
E: raspy
C: WIFEY
D: Alright. Looking forward to it.
E: O.S.
C: COLE
D: Me too.
C: WIFEY
D: Talk soon.
E: O.S.
N: She hangs up. BANG!! The thugs have ALMOST MADE IT IN TO THE ROOM. Cole LOOKS to the DOOR. His EYES NARROW. He has a sense of RESOLVE. He’s gonna get out of this. He looks to the toolkit and picks up the can of FOAM INSULATION SPRAY and some DUCT TAPE. He SHOOTS the FOAM into his LEG WOUND.
C: COLE
D: RHHGGG!!
N: It CLOGS the bleeding, then he WRAPS duct tape TIGHTLY around it.
C: COLE
D: RRRRRAARRGGHH!!!
E: CONT'D
N: He looks to the door. They’re seconds from breaking through. He looks to the window, considering the option. He eyes one of the rickety floorboard and TAPS it with his foot. The other end of the floorboard pops up, like a see-saw. BAM! The door is KICKED wide open and THEY CHARGE IN. Hawk LEAPS at Cole, who SLAMS his foot on the rickety floorboard, causing it to TEETER up and WHACK Hawk in the face, knocking him on his ass.
C: DUX
D: YARRRGH!!
N: Dux JUMPS over Hawk and at Cole, but he INSTANTLY FALLS THROUGH THE BRITTLE FLOOR, causing the floorboards he crashed through to cause Cole to CATAPULT INTO THE AIR!
C: YUICHI COLE
D: AHHHHH!!!! AHHHHH!!!!
N: Cole lands HARD, HITTING ANOTHER FLOORBOARD and BREAKING through the floor and into the apartment below. His impact launches Hawk BACK UP TO THE APARTMENT ABOVE, which creates a hole that Balki falls DOWN into, which lands on a board that LAUNCHES Cole across the room. Dux falls through the floor, sending Cole flying BACK UP through the ceiling, landing him back in the upper apartment. It’s all over in a matter of seconds. Cole looks around. He’s alone and in shock. All the thugs have wound up in the apartment below him.
C: COLE
D: What the hell?
E: CONT'D
N: He GRABS his phone, which is miraculously beside him. He hears the muted sound of the thugs talking below him, then- BANG! BANG! BANG! Bullets RIP through the floor and one of them DESTROYS COLE’S PHONE!
C: COLE
D: My phone...
E: CONT'D
N: Pissed, Cole PUSHES a HEAVY TOOL CART towards a HOLE in the floor. Cole runs for the door as the cart FALLS through the hole and WE HEAR it causing a CHAIN REACTION below.
C: DUX LUCA
D: Look out! Oh shit!
E: O.S. O.S.
N: Cole is almost at the door, when Dux comes violently FLYING up through the hole in the floor. He hits the ceiling HARD, CRACKING it badly, then lands in front of Cole. He takes out his GUN and aims at Cole, when- CRASH! The cracked portion of the ceiling above Dux gives out and a FRIDGE DROPS from the apartment above, CRUSHING DUX as it LODGES halfway into the floor. Nearby floorboards SPRING UP, and the ONE COLE IS ON LAUNCHES HIM OUT THE OPEN WINDOW!
S: EXT. THE WILSHIRE - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole just barely manages to GRAB onto the LARGE BANNER which RIPS from the wire, SWINGING Cole back towards The Wilshire. He CRASHES back into the building through a window ONE STORY below.
S: EXT. THE WISHIRE - ABANDONED APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: He lands on the floor in a heap. In the BACKGROUND, the “Now Leasing” sign TEARS off and the wind WHIPS IT across the street where it SMACKS against the side of The Galleria. Cole looks up to see Hawk standing in front of him, regaining his bearings. They FACE off.
C: COLE
D: Alright motherfuc-
N: CRASH! Suddenly, Cole’s FOOT BREAKS THROUGH THE FLOOR and his LEG SINKS down up to his knee.
C: COLE
D: Fuck!
E: CONT'D
N: He tries to get up, propping himself on one arm. Hawk charges and takes a massive swing at Cole’s head, but Cole’s arm breaks through the floor, making him SLAM to the ground, causing Hawk to miss. Hawk RAISES his foot to STOMP on Cole but his OTHER LEG breaks through the floor. Cole HOBBLES to his feet. He feels a sharp pain in his SHOULDER and reaches back to find a NAIL sticking out of his LEFT SHOULDER BLADE. He grabs the DUCT TAPE and FOAM INSULTAION SPRAY, then RUNS!
S: INT. THE WILSHIRE - 20TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Cole rounds a corner as he RIPS the nail out of his shoulder.
C: COLE
D: Fuckin’ fuckey fuck!!!
N: He sloppily shoots FOAM onto the wound, and all over his back, as he passes a window looking down on to the street. Something catches his eyes and he STOPS in his tracks. FROM HIS POV we see a RED MERCEDES, parked RIGHT IN FRONT of his building.
C: COLE
D: Yes. Yes motherfucker. I’m gonna get out of here...
E: CONT'D to himself
N: He starts running towards the ELEVATOR. Just as he’s about to arrive at the elevator *BING* the doors open. Inside is a thug sitting on a MOTORCYCLE named SPARTAN. Spartan revs the motorcycle. Cole stands his ground, clutching his duct tape and insulation spray. It’s a very one- sided seeming showdown. Spartan GUNS it, ripping down the hall towards Cole. COLE waits till Spartan gets closer and then HURLS the duct tape at his head. It harmlessly BOUNCES off his helmet, and then Spartan RAMS his motorcycle directly into Cole! Cole FLIES back and SMASHES into a wall. He PULLS himself out of the wall and we see the SAME RAT from the beginning it STUCK TO THE CAULKING ON HIS BACK, thrashing around!
C: RAT
D: REEEEE!!!!
N: Spartan starts to dismount from his motorcycle. Cole, with the squealing rodent stuck to his back, reaches for his foam insulation spray can and CHARGES. Spartan reaches for his gun but Coal gets the draw on him and SPRAYS insulation foam all over Spartan’s visor, blinding him. Spartan flips up the visor, and Cole sprays foam directly IN HIS EYES!
C: SPARTAN
D: AHHHH!!!!
N: Spartan pulls off his helmet as Hawk rounds the corner! Spartan THROWS his helmet blindly as he clutches his face. The helmet NAILS Hawk in the balls. A split second later Cole HURLS the insulation can right in Hawk’s FACE, knocking him back. Cole, the RAT still stuck to his back, hops on the motorcycle and reaches for the throttle. Suddenly Hawk GRABS him from behind and starts to CHOKE HIM OUT! Cole REACHES for the throttle with all his strength... but it’s JUST out of reach! He’s losing consciousness... when, the RAT wriggles free from the foam, scampers onto Hawk’s face and BITES his cheek!
C: HAWK
D: AHH!!
N: He FLAILS back, letting go of Cole, who grabs the throttle and REVS it. The bike ZIPS forwards. Spartan sees the bike passing him and THROWS the can of foam in the wheel, attempting to trip up the bike. It back fires, EXPLODING MORE FOAM all over Spartan’s face as Cole SPEEDS away.
S: INT. THE WILSHIRE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole awkwardly RIPS down the hall and away from the thugs. He manages to get the bike around a corner and sees THE ELEVATOR. He starts heading towards it, when Spartan jumps out in front of him.
C: SPARTAN
D: AHHH!!!
N: Cole JUMPS off the bike, ditching it. It continues forward and CRASHES into Spartan, sending both him and the bike FLYING OUT a window.
C: SPARTAN
D: AHHHHHHHH-
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: SPLAT. Cole walks towards the broken window and looks down to see the motorcycle tangled in some ORANGE CONSTRUCTION NETTING hanging along the outside of the building, and Spartan’s body DEAD on the ground, right beside Animal’s dead body.
C: COLE
D: Oh man.
N: Cole snaps back into action and runs to the elevator. He frantically hits the button. The elvator arrives and he gets in. As the doors close, Cole sees Hawk rounding the corner!
C: HAWK
D: NOOOOO!!!
N: Cole descends towards the lobby as he tries to catch his breath.
C: COLE
D: Holy shit... Holy shit... you’re gonna fucking make it. You’re gonna fucking make it.
S: INT. THE WILSHIRE - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Cole RUNS out of the elevator and through the lobby of the building.
S: EXT. THE WILSHIRE - STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole bolts out on to the street. There’s some SUV’s parked behind the Red Mercedes. He KICKS in the car window and hops in the driver’s seat. With EXPERT SKILL, he hotwires the car, the engine REVVING.
C: COLE
D: I did it.
N: SLAM!!!!! A load of steel girders crashes to the ground in front of Cole, blocking his car in and partially CRUSHING the front of the SUV beside him. He looks up and sees a CRANE HOOK a few stories above, swaying, clearly having just dropped this load.
C: COLE
D: WHAT?!
E: CONT'D
N: He looks and sees Hawk RUNNING towards him.
C: COLE
D: FUUUCK!!!
E: CONT'D
N: Hawk hot on his tail, Cole hops out of the car and sprints across the street towards a LARGE CONSTRUCTION YARD that runs alongside THE GALLERIA (the nearly-completed building across the street).
S: EXT. THE GALLERIA - CONSTRUCTION YARD - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole hauls ass through the construction yard. He passes a FLATBED filled with PINK INSULATION FOAM. He sees a nearby CONSTRUCTION ELEVATORS that run up the side of The Galleria. I/E. THE GALLERIA - CONSTRUCTION ELEVATORS - CONTINUOUS He gets in one of the elevators and presses UP. The elevator starts to ASCEND. The exhausted Cole tries to catch his breath, when suddenly the elevator STOPS.
C: COLE
D: Shit. What do I do? Fuck me.
N: Cole looks DOWN and sees a furious Hawk on ground level, the CONTROLS TO THE ELEVATOR in hand. Hawk hits a button and the elevator starts to DESCEND towards him. Cole tries to override the controls on the console in the elevator carriage, but he can’t. He sees he’s passing ANOTHER CONTRUCTION elevator.
C: COLE
D: Okay... okay... you got this!
E: CONT'D to himself
N: HE LEAPS to it as his elevator passes, landing in the open basket!
C: COLE
D: Oh fuck. Oh thank god.
E: CONT'D
N: He HITS the BUTTON and starts to ASCEND.
C: COLE
D: Eat shit you nazi!!
E: CONT'D
C: HAWK
D: What?! I’m not a nazi!
E: yelling from below
N: Cole FLIPS him off as Hawk starts to run to a nearby BOOM LIFT. Hawk gets in the drivers seat, EXTENDS the BUCKET and SWINGS it towards Cole’s elevator.
C: COLE
D: Oh no!!!
N: Cole begins to attempt a leap to the next elevator, but the basket of the boom lift HITS the elevator before he can. Cole STUMBLES and FALLS into the basket of the boom lift.
C: COLE
D: Oh fuck. Oh fuck.
E: CONT'D
N: He gets up and sees a CONTROL PANEL in the basket. He starts MOVING THE BUCKET of the boom lift towards the building so he can escape. Seeing this, Hawk quickly starts driving the CAB of the boom lift AWAY from the building.
C: COLE
D: Nooo!!!
E: CONT'D
N: Meanwhile, the other construction elevators are beginning to BUCKLE and BREAK from the damage. They start to COLLAPSE and FALL INTO ONE ANOTHER!!! Cole extends the bucket as Hawk reverses the cab. Just as the machine has reached its full length, Cole LEAPS, landing on top of the THIRD construction elevator. He made it! BAM!!! The other construction elevators SMASH into the beam of Cole’s elevator. Cole HANGS ON FOR DEAR LIFE as the elevator SWINGS DOWN on its beams and CRASHES through the windows a few floors below! The ELEVATOR comes loose and SKIDS across the floor, Cole CLUTCHING on desperately as he RIDES IT. It SMASHES through equipment and furniture as it SLOWLY slides to a stop. Cole gets up and looks at himself. He’s shocked to find he’s not incredibly hurt. He sees a STAIRCASE with a sign that reads ROOF DECK and RUNS TOWARDS IT, disappearing up the stairs. WE HOLD on the stairs. A moment later, we see a TIRED and ANGRY Hawk rising up after him in the extending boom lift.
S: EXT. THE GALLERIA - ROOF - MOMENTS LATER
N: Cole bursts out of the stairwell and onto the ROOF. He looks for somewhere to hide... when he hears the COCKING of a GUN.
C: HAWK
D: Ohhhh, I got you.
E: O.S.
N: Hawk steps into frame and puts his gun to Cole’s head.
C: COLE
D: Wait.
C: HAWK
D: You fucking killed Animal.
C: COLE
D: I know! I’m sorry-
C: HAWK
D: Shut up! There’s nothing you can say. He. Was. MY. BROTHER. Here it comes.
E: beat
C: COLE
D: You don’t understand! I’m the-
C: HAWK
D: Good night.
N: AS WE HEAR A BANG! WE CUT TO BLACK. MUSIC UP: WHOLE LOTTA LOVE By TINA TURNER
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DUSK
N: Looking down an empty, abandoned street with TWO TOWERING BUILDING at the end of it, facing one another. THE WILSHIRE to the left, and THE GALLERIA to the right. TITLE UP: 7:00 PM. We hold on the frame for a long beat, then headlights can be seen quickly approaching, brightening as they near. As the car pulls up in front of The Galleria we see that it’s a woman in a RED MERCEDES (the car Cole will try to steal) the same woman Cole saw being attacked. We properly meet MADELINE “MAD” MARTIGAN. 45, stylish, and VERY confident. She steps out wearing HEADPHONES, POINTY EARRINGS in her ears, listening to the same Tina Turner we’re hearing. She walks to the trunk and pulls out a piece of BEAUTIFUL ROLLING LOUIS VITTON LUGGAGE and a matching PURSE. She stares in the trunk for a moment... We see RED LIGHT emanating from it, but don’t see what she’s seeing. She SLAMS it shut and heads towards THE GALLERIA. She approaches the entrance with a cocky swagger and great purpose. She pulls out a RABBIT’S FOOT keychain attached to a FOB. She swipes it and enters the building.
S: INT. THE GALLERIA - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
N: Martigan walks through the revolving doors and begins to strut across the uber-modern lobby like a boxer walking towards the ring. She hits the elevator button and then rolls her shoulders back. The doors open, and she enters.
S: INT. THE GALLERIA - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
N: The walls of the elevator are LED screens elegantly playing beautiful forest scenery. As the elevator ascends the scenery changes as though there were no walls and it was soaring up through a forest and into the sky. Martigan cracks her neck. The doors open and she exits.
S: INT. THE GALLERIA - 20TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Martigan’s music pumps her up, and a knowing smirk creeps across her face. Martigan stops at a door, uses her FOB, and enters an apartment.
S: INT. THE GALLERIA - 20TH FLOOR - MAD MARTIGAN’S APARTMENT -
N: CONTINUOUS Martigan walks into her apartment. A modern, high end, two level, open floorplan loft apartment that’s parsely decorated with fine furniture and little else. She scans the room, when she notices a LIGHT ACROSS THE STREET at THE WILSHIRE. She SEES COLE across the way texting on his cell. She narrows her eyes at him, taking note. Martigan begins to move with purpose, enacting a plan. She opens her suitcase where there’s a series of VASES in foam cases. She takes the vases and starts placing them on a LARGE BOOKCASE. She opens ANOTHER PART of the bag and pulls out a SINGLE SMART LIGHT BULB. She takes the bulb and goes into the BEDROOM, unscrews the bulb in the lamp, and replaces it with her own. She then puts a couple more VASES on a SHELF in the bedroom. She looks at her watch. 7:15 pm. She LOOKS out her window, down the road... expecting someone. And then, HEADLIGHTS appear. THREE SUVS emerge from the darkness and pull to a stop in front of the building. THUGS pour out of the vehicles. She counts how many there are as they head towards the entrance of THE GALLERIA.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Alright. Game time.
N: She walks away from the window and sits in a chair that she’s positioned in the middle of the room, and waits... BAM!! Her apartment door gets KICKED OPEN, knocking it half- off its hinges, and her place is stormed by 16 ARMED, MASKED THUGS. Martigan stays seated as they rush her. The MAIN THUG, in his crisp white and already blood-splattered suit steps forward. BAM! He PUNCHES Martigan in the face. She barely reacts. The Main Thug aggressively takes her hands BEHIND the chair, pulls a ZIP TIE out of his shirt pocket, and BINDS her hands. BAM! He punches Martigan again, then WHIPS out his GUN and puts it to her HEAD. This is TIKTOK, (vain and cocky). Several other thugs remove their masks and we reveal they are HARRIET THE SPY (scarred up, scary, and British), VINCE (huge and roided out), DUX (tattooed with a big machete, from earlier), RIGGS, (grizzled biker woman) Hawk and Animal (who we’ve also met...) TikTok takes out his cell and makes a call. Someone answers.
C: TIKTOK
D: Hey Boss. We got Mad Martigan. Found her at the safe house on 7th street. Yes, sir.
E: beat
N: TikTok puts The Boss on SPEAKER PHONE and holds up the phone. Beat.
C: THE BOSS
D: Hey Madeline... I found you.
E: O.S. through speaker phone
N: There’s a chilling quiver in his voice. He sounds VOLITILE and EMOTIONAL.
C: THE BOSS
D: Now... you just sit tight. I’ll be there in... forty-five minutes. And then... we can talk. I’m pretty... bent out of shape right now. But... we’ll talk. Alright, guys. Keep her right there. If you have to shoot her for some reason, I understand. But, ideally, I call dibs on that.
E: O.S. CONT'D through speaker phone beat louder
N: CLICK. The Boss hangs up. We see the thugs understand the implication of this statement. TikTok PUMPS his fist.
C: TIKTOK
D: Holy fucking hell YES! We beat her! WE DID IT! We beat Mad Martigan! Whew. What a rush. Fuck! Everyone okay? You guys all okay? Dux? Vince? You guys good?
E: looking around
C: DUX
D: I’m good.
C: VINCE
D: You know I’ve been waiting for this.
C: TIKTOK
D: I fucking GOT HER! This was my moment to prove myself and I fucking DID IT! I mean, WE did it! But, you know, led by me!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Wait, wait, wait, WHAT?! He put YOU in charge of coming to get me?
C: TIKTOK
D: Fuck yeah he did! Who else would be in charge of coming to get you?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I mean, obviously, Harriet The Spy!
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Oh, you’re not gonna win me over with compliments, you backstabbing fuckwad! But yes, thank you. I agree.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Anyone but Tiktok!
C: TIKTOK
D: My name is NOT Tiktok!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Oh shit. Is that a “behind your back” nickname? I thought it was a “to your face” nickname.
C: TIKTOK
D: It’s neither! I don’t want anyone calling me fucking “TikTok” on either side of my fucking back or face!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: After what happened, how the fuck do we not call you TikTok.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WATERFOUNTAIN - DAY (TIKTOK VIDEO)
N: We see a young woman RECORDING a SILLY DANCE for the app TIKTOK in front of a water fountain. She is completely oblivious as, in the background, we see our TikTok chasing another THUG in a suit. He STABS the guy in the shoulder and he falls in to the waterfountain! The woman KEEPS DANCING, unaware, as TikTok comes in for the killing blow, but slips and falls into the fountain! The thug and TikTok thrash in the water as they fight over the knife. TikTok finally manages to take the knife and STABS the guy in the head. The thug flops down, dead. Tiktok looks around at all the people staring at him and RUNS OFF. The woman, still unaware, dances as her TikTok handle, GIGGLEPUFFS 42, fills the screen.
T: CUT BACK TO:
S: INT. MAD MARTIGAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Back to the scene.
C: TIKTOK
D: Fuck that, and fuck YOU.
N: TikTok PUNCHES Martigan.
C: TIKTOK
D: So... we got some time to kill, why don’t you answer the question everyone’s been dying to know... What the fuck is your sitch’?
E: CONT'D beat
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: ... I want out.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Wait... what? YOU want “out”? You?! What?!?
E: genuinely shocked
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yeah. Me. I want out. I’m done. I want to retire. Live my life. I’ve changed.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: You know, I’m hearing it, but I’m having a hard time believing it. What’s the angle?
E: skeptical
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: No angle. I went to The Boss, and I told him I wanted out. And he said no.
C: TIKTOK
D: Yeah! No fucking shit! This job obviously has it’s plusses and minuses, but newsflash! You can’t fucking quit! Nobody gets to quit!
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Remember Singapore Sam? He went all the way to Singapore after he quit, and we still killed him! Total logistical nightmare. Three flights, a boat ride-
C: TIKTOK
D: Two boat rides!
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: We couldn’t get guns so we had to use machetes which was a mess, to say the least.
C: TIKTOK
D: So gross.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Look, I know all that shit, which is why, after he said no, I thought two things... One, I’m still retiring and nobody, especially this motherfucker, is gonna stop me. And two, I’m getting ahead of this asshole, and instead of letting that dork get RE-venge on my ass for leaving, I’m getting some PRE-venge on his for not letting me leave.
C: TIKTOK
D: Pre-venge?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yeah. It’s this thing I invented. It’s when you get revenge on someone you pissed off before they get revenge on you for the thing that you did that pissed them off. It’s wayyy better than normal revenge. More pro-active.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: I’ve never heard of it before, but I’m already literally obsessed.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: You should be. So, soon, I’ll take all of you out; which is what you fucking assholes get for thinking you can come here and kill me. It’s quite honestly fucking offensive. And after that, The Boss’ll get here, I’ll take him out, and then I’m done.
N: They all look to each other.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: This doesn’t add up. You want to “retire”? Why? You’re a lying, stealing, murdering motherfucker, Just like the rest of us. And that’s all you are.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Apparently not, ‘cause I want out.
C: TIKTOK
D: Well, tough titties in yo’ cities, ‘cause in case you haven’t noticed... you’re f-f-fucked!
N: Martigan shrugs and smiles. ANGLE ON: Martigan’s hands, bound behind the chair. She slowly moves a finger towards her SMART WATCH, then TAPS it. The LIGHTS she installed earlier in the bedroom TURN ON.
C: TIKTOK
D: What the fuck?
E: CONT'D
N: TikTok motions to a group of FIVE thugs and they start moving towards the other room. Martigan taps her watch again and a DETONATOR comes up. She eyes all the VASES she put on the shelves and the nearby thugs. FROM A BIRD’S EYE VIEW we see half the THUGS are positioned in front of one bookshelf filled with her VASES and the other half of the thugs are being LURED towards the bedroom, where there’s another bookshelf filled with her VASES. And Martigan is positioned as far away from them as possible. We ANGLE on the VASES in the bedroom as the five thugs TikTok sent walk towards it. CLOSE ON the VASES behind TikTok and the remaining thugs. Martigan as she assesses everyone in the room. CLOSE ON her wrist as she inches closer to hitting the DETONATE BUTTON. CLOSE ON the VASES in the bedroom as the group of thugs gets closer and closer. CLOSE ON Martigan as she rolls her neck a little, preparing to spring into action. CLOSE ON her watch again, her finger ABOUT TO HIT THE BUTTON... THEN- Martigan is genuinely surprised to see a RED LASER BEAM moving across TikTok’s chest. TikTok notices Martigan’s shocked expression and looks down to see the laser.
C: TIKTOK
D: GET COVER!
E: CONT'D
N: TikTok and all the other thugs duck and move for cover while they draw their weapons. For the first time, Martigan’s calm and confident demeanor breaks. She’s genuinely confused. This was not part of her plan. The thugs that were being lured towards the other room stop and TURN AWAY from all the VASES and TAKE COVER. Martigan sees this and tries to hide how furious she is as her finger moves away from the detonator. TikTok motions towards numerous different thugs as he gives orders.
C: TIKTOK
D: Dux, take Riggs and go up a floor. See what you can see! You three! Watch the hall! You two go to the lobby. Go! Go!
E: CONT'D
N: The thugs all exit the apartment. Martigan doesn’t like it. Her assailants are scattered to the wind. We see her doing math. How to put her plan back together. The thugs all clearly see Cole across the street, pointing what appears to be a gun with a laser sight at them. The laser beam vanishes and Cole duck’s out of view.
C: TIKTOK
D: What the fuck? Harriet?! Who is that?! Is that our guy?
E: CONT'D
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Why would our guy be aiming a sniper gun at us?
N: Martigan has this same thought.
C: TIKTOK
D: Then who is it?
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: It’s obviously some fuckin’ guy she’s got working with her.
C: TIK TOK
D: Not that obvious! Jesus!
N: Martigan tries to hide her confusion and figure out her next move. Hawk runs up beside TikTok.
C: HAWK
D: Yo! Me and Animal will sort this fucker out.
N: TikTok nods. Hawk and Animal move out, off to find Cole.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: I’m calling The Boss, telling him you fucked everything up.
C: TIKTOK
D: No!! It’s not fucked yet! I got this!
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: You don’t “got” shit, TikTok!
C: TIKTOK
D: Don’t second guess me, and don’t call me that! You aren’t calling anyone! I’m in charge! Go watch the elevators!
N: Harriet begrudgeingly runs out the door, glancing back at Martigan. Vince pulls his gun, points it at Martigan.
C: VINCE
D: Let’s just kill her, before this gets worse!
E: to Tiktok
C: TIKTOK
D: No! We can’t! Not yet. You heard The Boss. Not unless we have to! The dibs! Remember?! We MUST respect his dibs! What are you doing here, Martigan?! Is this the pre-venge? Is it happening now?!
E: to Martigan
N: MARTIGAN assesses the room: TikTok, Vincent and FIVE OTHER THUGS.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yep.
N: Martigan smiles and HITS THE BUTTON ON HER WATCH. BOOM!!! The VASES EXPLODE and TikTok and all the thugs are KNOCKED to the ground. Only Vincent manages to stand his ground. Martigan, screaming like a maniac, SPRINGS from her chair, hands still zip tied behind her back, and CHARGES at Vincent.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: RRARARRRRR!!!
E: CONT'D
N: She delivers a BRUTAL FLYING KNEE to his chin and he goes down HARD. She pivots towards another THUG and SMASHES her FOREHEAD into his face as hard as she can. He GRABS HIS NOSE, SCREAMING. Another THUG aims his gun at her; she KICKS the chair at him, SMASH! The thug falls back. She notices he is standing in front of another VASE and TAPS her watch. BOOM! It EXPLODES, killing him. She JUMPS up and lifts her legs over her zip-tied arms, bringing them back in FRONT OF HER. BAM! BAM! She ducks as we reveal TikTok SHOOTING at her. Martigan dives behind the KITCHEN ISLAND. TikTok unloads his clip. BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! CLICK. He sees his bullets are lodged in the marble counter top.
C: TIKTOK
D: Fuckin’ hell-
N: Martigan SMASHES out from a cabinet UNDER the kitchen island and scampers across the ground like a wild animal. She TACKLES TikTok’s legs and SLAMS him on the ground. He drops his gun and it skids across the floor. They stand up and face off. TikTok whips out a KNIFE. Martigan’s hands are still zip-tied in front of her.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Bring it.
N: He SWIPES at her and she LOOPS her arms around his and SLIDES her wrists up to his knife, cutting off the zip ties. She then adeptly pulls TikTok’s knife out of his hand and they face off once more, but this time she’s holding the knife. TikTok pulls out TWO MORE KNIVES.
C: TIKTOK
D: Hahah! I got knives for days, son.
N: She WHIPS her knife at his face. He raises his arm to block it and the knife STABS into his forearm.
C: TIKTOK
D: AHH! Fuck!
E: CONT'D
N: He drops his knives. She jumps and delivers a DEVASTATING ELBOW to his face.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: BOOM!!!
N: He’s unconscious before he hits the ground. Martigan looks around the room. The plan is totally fucked. New plan.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Alright... six down, ten to go.
E: CONT'D
N: She looks across the street to Cole’s apartment - the blinds are now closed. Who was that? Why did he help her? Where did he go? She snaps back to her mission, dashes over to her LUGGAGE and unzips it. She puts on a TACTICAL VEST. She pulls TWO SETS OF BRASS KNUCKLES out and slides them into little HOLSTERS that are built into the sides of her tactical vest. She takes out a BELT with knives and other weapons on it and straps it to her waist. She straps on a CAMELBAK with several storage compartments. She CLIPS the tube to her shoulder, takes a BIG SIP, and then spits out some bloody water. She puts her hair in a PONYTAIL and we REVEAL she has a SCORPION TATTOO on the back of her neck. She then puts a BRIGHT 80’S FILA HEADBAND on, takes out a HUGE HANDGUN, and cocks it. She AIMS at TikTok’s head as he lies unconcious on the ground, when SUDDENLY Dux and RIGGS BURST into the room, GUNS DRAWN! Martigan WHIPS around and trains her gun on them. They all freeze. It’s a stand off.
C: DUX
D: I don’t know what you were planning here, but your luck has run out.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: You fucking idiots. My luck never runs out.
N: She starts to squeeze the trigger when - CRASH!!! A FIRE EXTINGUISHER flies in through the open window and SLAMS into her hand!!! Her gun is KNOCKED out of her hand and the extinguisher SMASHES into a nearby wall; it’s clearly the same FIRE EXTINGUISHER that FLEW OUT OF COLE’S APARTMENT during his fight with Hawk (page 10).
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Hmmmm...
E: CONT'D concerned
N: Martigan is briefly stunned and visibly upset. Bad luck. Again. Everyone else is stunned for a brief moment too, but then they all SNAP back to it. Dux and Riggs open fire on the flabbergasted Martigan. She has no choice but to RUN. She GRABS HER PURSE and RAMS into the front door, which was already half-off its hinges, and KNOCKS it completely off as she BARGES into the hallway.
S: INT. THE GALLERIA - 20TH FLOOR - MAD MARTIGAN’S APARTMENT
N: HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Martigan uses the door like a shield, looking through the peephole as she backs up down the hallway. Dux and Riggs exit out the same door and immediately open FIRE. Their bullets lodge into the door. Then... a few shots start to go THROUGH.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: FUCK.
N: She drops the door and RUNS down the hall toward TWO LARGE REGAL BRASS DOORS. She RAMS into them and enters-
S: INT. THE GALLERIA - 20TH FLOOR - DHARMA RESTAURANT -
N: CONTINUOUS A gigantic, 7 stories tall, extremely high-end Chinese restaurant composed of descending terraced balconies. A giant stone Buddha sits peacefully in the centre of it all. Encircling the restaurant one level up are the balconies of luxury stores, nightclubs, and cafes. She sees something and SMILES: two SAMURAI STATUES flanking the BAR, each with a SPEAR and a SHEILD. She RUNS over, grabs a spear, and turns towards the door as Dux and Riggs enter. She HURLS the spear and it PIERCES THROUGH RIGGS’S SHOULDER, NAILING her to a column!!!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: OHH!!! What a shot!
C: RIGGS
D: OH GOD YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!!!
N: BLAM! BLAM! Dux OPENS FIRE as Martigan RUNS for it. She sees a GIANT OVERHANGING CHANDELIER suspended in the air by TWO ROPES. Martigan LEAPS off a balcony towards the chandelier and in mid-air HURLS her purse UP and BEHIND her, allowing her to use both hands to GRAB ahold of the chandelier. Her PURSE lands on a balcony one story up. She pulls out a small knife and CUTS one of the ropes holding up the chandelier. SNAP! Martigan holds on as the chanedelier SWINGS down. Martigan lets go a second before the chandelier SHATTERS against the far wall. She rolls on the ground and springs up to her feet and then, keeping her momentum, RUNS out a nearby doorway.
S: INT. THE GALLERIA - 13TH FLOOR - UNFINISHED DARK FLOOR -
N: CONTINUOUS Martigan finds herself in a massive empty dark room. She hits the light switches and we see the room light up. It’s a HUGE UNFINISHED floor with almost nothing in it. She notices a TOOL KIT sitting in front of a BREAKER BOX. She walks over and opens the tool kit, then pulls out a hammer. She then starts FLICKING off breakers until the lights go out. She holds up the hammer, thinks for a moment, and then uses it to SMASH THE SHIT out of the breaker box.
C: DUX
D: She’s went this way!
E: O.S.
N: She quickly sneaks off into the darkness, vanishing just as Dux enters the now-pitch-black room. He immediately notices the breaker box, sparks popping out from it. Harriet and Vince show up. Dux points out the busted breaker box. Harriet tries the light switches, but they’re dead. TikTok, Dux, and four other thugs enter the room.
C: TIKTOK
D: Yo! You guys get her?!
C: DUX
D: No. Shhh! She’s in here somewhere.
E: whispering
C: TIKTOK
D: She is? Whoa. Okay.
E: whispering
N: They pull out FLASHLIGHTS and search for Martigan while continuing to speak in hushed tones.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Stick together.
C: TIKTOK
D: Yeah. Exactly. Don’t be stupid. Stick together.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Keep your backs to each other.
C: TIKTOK
D: Back to fucking back, team. Make a circle.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: You just gonna repeat everything I say?
C: TIKTOK
D: You just gonna pre-peat everything I say?
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: What?
C: TIKTOK
D: Pre-peat. You know what I’m going to say, so you’re just saying it before me so I seem redundant ‘cause you don’t like me.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: That’s not a thing.
C: TIKTOK
D: I didn’t think it was either, but here we are.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: You’re just reappropriating Martigan’s pre-venge thing.
C: TIKTOK
D: Maybe she pre-appropriated that from me!
N: REVEAL that Martigan is hiding behind a nearby pillar, LISTENING to the conversation, clutching a hammer.
C: TIKTOK
D: Okay, everyone shut up!
E: CONT'D
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: You were the only one talki-
C: TIKTOK
D: I said SHUT UP! Just chill. Look. Pep talk. I’m not gonna lie, here’s the real real: we have been lured INTO a trap. We’re in the trap. Like, right now. In real time. But, here’s the great news: we got this. Because if we don’t got this, she’s gonna kill us, or, if we fail The Boss’ll just kill us. So we GOTTA got this. You guys got that?
C: VINCENT
D: Got it.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: We should seriously warn The Boss. Tell him not to come.
C: TIKTOK
D: No! Not yet! We still got time, and we can do anything together. Teamwork makes the dreamwork. And right now our dream is killing this woman.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: We should at least un-dib The Boss’s dibs!
C: TIKTOK
D: Alright, fine. I too believe it is correct to un-dib The Boss’s dibs. We’re going from capture to kill. We have no choice. The situation has changed. He’ll ultimately understand... I hope.
C: THUG
D: Just cause we’re allowed to kill her, doesn’t mean we CAN! She’s a fucking machine. We can’t stop her.
C: VINCE
D: We can. We can stop her. And I know how.
E: beat
N: Vince stares at everyone dramatically.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Well, spit it out!
C: VINCE
D: She has a friend.
N: We PUSH in on Martigan as a look of DREAD comes over her face.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: What do you mean... a friend?
E: O.S.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
N: CHRYON: SIX MONTHS AGO
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY
N: We see MARTIGAN as she confidently walks down a hill in downtown, the Los Angeles COURTHOUSE behind her.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yeah, the guy didn’t say shit. And he’s not gonna say shit. We’re good.
E: on the phone
N: She puts her phone away as she stops at a crosswalk. She notices beside her a COP CAR is parked behind a WOMAN’S CAR. The cop is giving her shit as they both stand on the sidewalk.
C: WOMAN
D: Look, I’m sorry, I’m having the worst day, and I ran out of gas. I didn’t mean to stop here.
C: COP
D: Miss, I understand that, but nonetheless, I’m gonna have to write you a ticket for being here and blocking this lane.
C: WOMAN
D: I had no choice! The tow truck is coming! Please! There’s not much traffic, I’m not blocking anything.
C: COP
D: Miss, calm down.
C: WOMAN
D: I am calm!
C: COP
D: Calm down, miss!
N: Martigan shakes her head. This cop is getting on her nerves.
C: COP
D: Don’t make me take you in for disorderly conduct.
E: CONT'D
C: WOMAN
D: I’m literally just talking to you! Is that illegal?
C: COP
D: It is if I want it to be. Now lower your fucking voice!
N: Martigan’s had it. Without the COP seeing, she walks over, reaches in to his car, and puts it from PARK into NEUTRAL. The woman sees this happening over the cop’s shoulder. Martigan walks away from the car as it starts to roll DOWN A HUGE HILL.
C: WOMAN
D: Uh...
N: The woman points out the rolling car to the cop.
C: COP
D: Fuck me!!!!
N: He RUNS off down the hill, chasing his car. The WOMAN looks over to Martigan, who watches the cop chase his car with a smile. The cops FALLS as he chases the car, which then SLAMS in to a pole, causing both of the women to react.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Hmm.
C: WOMAN
D: Holy shit that was crazy!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I’m sorry, I just fucking hate cops so much.
C: WOMAN
D: Wow! Thank you! I mean... wow!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Really, it’s fine. Not a big deal.
C: WOMAN
D: No, it IS a big deal. I mean, I don’t wanna dump my shit on you, but this is one of the worst days of my life and to have stranger actually be nice to me... well, let’s just say it makes me not want to fucking kill myself. I mean not really, like, actually kill myself, but, you know, at least be pretty shitty to myself. Anyway, thanks. You’re a good person.
N: Beat.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: ... really?
C: WOMAN
D: Yeah, really!
N: Martigan is speechless for a moment and has to gather herself.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Nobody’s ever said that to me before.
C: WOMAN
D: Well, that cop might disagree...
N: We see the cop, trying to pull his car back, and the POLE falls, SMASHING the front of his car even more.
C: WOMAN
D: ... but you are! I’m Naomi.
E: CONT'D beat
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I’m Madeline.
C: NAOMI
D: Please, let me buy you a drink or something.
N: Martigan smiles.
S: INT. CAFE - SOON AFTER
N: Martigan and Naomi are drinking at a table.
C: NAOMI
D: So, what do you do?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I work in finance.
C: NAOMI
D: You like it?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Well, I’m really good at it. Like really, really good at. I’m known as being a ruthless killer. Like one of the baddest motherfuckers in the whole city... when it comes to finance. And it’s kind of nice having people be, like, afraid of me.
C: NAOMI
D: Oh, yeah. I can’t even imagine. No one’s afraid of me. If anything I wish I could stick up for myself better.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: But if I’m being real with myself, having people be afraid of me isn’t the best way to get self-worth. And also, it breeds a really toxic work environment. I mean, nobody trusts each other, and they shouldn’t. Anyone would fuck over anyone else to make The Boss happy.
C: NAOMI
D: How’s your boss?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Jesus. He’s a full fledged psychopath. He’s empty inside, so he buys the most expensive and rarest shit, so he, like, feels special. But he really doesn’t see the people who work for him any differently. They’re all just his... stuff. And, on top of that, he has, like a HUGE fucking crush on me, which is super gross and just makes the whole thing fucking... not great.
C: NAOMI
D: That sucks. I know what it’s like having toxic people in your life. And I try to keep them out, but... it’s harder than it should be.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yeah, I don’t think I’ve actually said it all out loud like that before. Hearing it, it’s really fucked. What’s weird is... I just met you, but I haven’t really been this honest with someone... maybe ever?
C: NAOMI
D: Feel free. I’m honored.
N: They enjoy a moment of silence.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: So, you married? Kids? Pets? Any of that?
C: NAOMI
D: No kids. No pets. Mid-divorce. And honestly, I don’t want to even talk about that fucking asshole. Maybe another time. When I’m a lot drunker. Speaking of which, should we get more wine?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Fuck yes.
N: Naomi LAUGHS. Martigan laughs too, looking at Naomi, laughing in SLO MOTION. MAD MARTIGAN AND NAOMI BECOMING FRIENDS MONTAGE: MUSIC UP: YOU GOT A FRIEND IN ME by RANDY NEWMAN - Martigan and Naomi take a BOXING WORKOUT CLASS together. Martigan is intense as she beats the shit out of a punching bag. Naomi looks on, impressed. - Martigan STORMS a MANSION with the other THUGS. We see her EXPERTLY KILL several rival criminals. She finds herself next to a huge WINE RACK. She takes a bottle. - WE SEE Martigan an Naomi sitting on a sun deck, enjoying the bottle of wine. - Martigan pulls up at a park in her car. She goes to the trunk, where we SEE there’s a BOUND AND GAGGED man in the back. She pulls out a SUN HAT, SLAMS the trunk, then runs over meets Naomi and a few OTHER WOMEN who are having a picnic. - Martigan is at the DOCKS, hunkered down, in the middle of an intense FIRE FIGHT. She pulls out her phone and sees she got a text from Naomi that says: “UGH!!! Worst date ever! The guy was such an asshole!” Martigan BLASTS off some SHOTS, taking out a few thugs. She texts back: He doesn’t deserve you! Fuck that asshole!! I’ll come over after work and we’ll hang!” She puts the phone away and smiles as she advances, guns blazing. - Martigan CRACKING A SAFE with a team of thugs using a giant BLOWTORCH. It opens and we see it’s full of DIAMONDS. Martigan covertly pockets a small HANDFUL. - Martigan enters Naomi’s house. There’s snacks and wine on the coffee table.
C: NAOMI
D: Movie night!!!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Wait a sec. ‘Cause first, I got you something. And, I know it’s kind of lame and childish... but...
N: She pulls out half of an BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND ENCRUSTED “BFF” NECKLACE that she had made with the diamonds she pocketed.
C: NAOMI
D: Holy SHIT!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I have the other half! Again, I know it’s kind of dumb, and we are grown women, and you don’t even have to wear it, but ever since I was a kid, I wanted someone to have half of one of these with... and, sadly, it took me ‘till now to find that person.
C: NAOMI
D: That is so nice!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: You really get me. You know who I am. And you’ve helped me grow and change. Which also is why... I’m gonna quit my job.
C: NAOMI
D: Really? That’s awesome!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yeah, I mean, I have enough money. And, you know... hanging out with you- made me realize there’s life outside my job, you know? Like I thought I was only one thing, but maybe... I can be another thing?
C: NAOMI
D: Hell yeah. You are NOT your job. Some people are. You’re not. ‘Cause your job sounds terrible and you’re not terrible.
N: This really warms Martigan’s heart.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: And instead of working, you know what I’m going to do? Fucking nothing!
E: beat
C: NAOMI
D: Good! If you don’t have to, why should you do anything? Doing things, and having your worth tied to them, is a bullshit construct of American society. In other countries, they have no shame about not having ambition! They just live life!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yeah. I’m gonna quit. I’m gonna quit.
E: beat
S: EXT. THE BOSS’S HOUSE - DAY
N: Martigan pulls up outside an INSANE architectural house that is PRECARIOUSLY HANGING over the side of a Hollywood Hills cliff. She knocks on the door and VINCE answers.
C: VINCE
D: He’s waiting for you.
N: He LEADS Martigan through the HUGE open house, which is COVERED in CRAZY art and other collectibles. A TYRANNOSAURUS SKULL. Art by KAWS and Murakami. There’s a glass WINDOW IN THE FLOOR looking down on the hill below the house. She’s brought to the living room. Theirs a MASSIVE wall of floor to ceiling windows looking out to an incredible view of the “HOLLYWOOD” sign. There’s a MAN looking out the window. As Martigan walks up, Vince hangs back, going in to another room.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Hey boss.
N: The Boss turns around and we see him for the first time.
C: THE BOSS
D: Yooooo!!!!! Madeline!! Hey!!!
N: He walks over and HUGS her tightly. She does NOT return it.
C: THE BOSS
D: Holy fuck!! It’s been weeks! How ya’ll living? Fat I hope!
E: CONT'D
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yep. Super fat.
C: THE BOSS
D: Noice! Speaking of fat, you like the new crib!? Isn’t it dope!?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yeah, it’s incredible.
C: THE BOSS
D: Designed by Japanase master architect Hizau Uzo. The dude’s a fucking pimp. I mean, the Japanese, are like, in general, more dope at things, but this dude is like next level! He’s like Japanese times a thousand! And THIS is the last house he ever designed? How fucking awesome is THAT?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: He died?
C: THE BOSS
D: I killed him. Right after I moved in, to make sure it was the last house he ever designed, because again, how awesome is that?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Super awesome.
C: THE BOSS
D: Only problem is, this whole half of it is kinda... slowly collapsing and making the whole house start to slide down the cliffside. And what’s fucked is Uzo is the ONLY one who would know how to fix it, and he’s dead! Irony! Right? Like, call Alanis Morissette, have her write a new verse about THAT shit!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Totally.
C: THE BOSS
D: Anyway, take a seat. You like that chair? I stole it from J. Balvin’s house. I saw it on his IG live and had some guys jack it. So dope, right?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yeah... amazing.
C: THE BOSS
D: So... what can I do you for? You taking me up on my offer? Weekend in Catalina? It’s noice there. So quaint. So dope.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Uh... no. That’s not it. Actually, kind of the opposite. I’m out.
E: beat
C: THE BOSS
D: You’re out?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yeah. I’m done.
C: THE BOSS
D: Well... no you’re not.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Well... I am. That’s what I’m saying.
C: THE BOSS
D: No... you’re not. You can’t be.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I know it might seem like that, but people change-
C: THE BOSS
D: No, I mean, you can’t be, because I’m not gonna let you. Like you can’t quit.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: What do you mean, I can’t?
C: THE BOSS
D: I mean, I’ve invested so much in you... and I like you. And...
E: MORE
C: THE BOSS
D: as you can see... when I like something, I want it around.
E: CONT'D
N: The Boss motions towards his many belongings.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: You mean someone.
C: THE BOSS
D: Sure. Yeah, whatever. Either way, you can’t quit. You’re mine.
C: Professionally. I mean, maybe
D: personally, we’ll cross that bridge later, again, maybe in Catalina, which is so so noice.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I don’t think I’m gonna take “no” for an answer here.
C: THE BOSS
D: Well, then I’m gonna kill your friend.
N: A look of TERROR comes over Martigan’s face.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: What friend? I don’t have any friends.
C: THE BOSS
D: Sure you do! This woman!
N: He pulls a picture out of his pocket and holds it up: it’s a long lens photo of NAOMI!!!
C: THE BOSS
D: I know you’ve been hanging out with her, even though you’ve been trying to keep it a secret. Which is mean. So if you try to quit, or leave, or do anything fucking whack, I’m gonna kill her. I know where she lives.
E: CONT'D
N: Martigan tries to hide her fear.
C: THE BOSS
D: And again, this is TOTALLY business related. Personally, there’s no conflict between us. Except I can’t get you to Catalina. Yet! Haha!
E: CONT'D beat MORE
C: THE BOSS
D: What’s so funny is one day we’ll be in Catalina together, and you’ll look at me, and laugh, and say, “you know what? It is noice here.”
E: CONT'D
N: Martigan eyes The Boss, smiles, and then stands up. She goes and opens the door, where Vince is waiting outside.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Copy that. All good. My bad. I’ll stick around. Thanks for the chat. Cool house.
C: THE BOSS
D: I know, right!!! I mean, the fucking view!!!
N: He motions to the Hollywood sign.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yep.
N: Martigan WALKS off. END FLASHBACK
S: INT. THE GALLERIA - UNFINISHED DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: All the thugs are standing around Vince. Martigan hides nearby.
C: TIKTOK
D: So fucking what? She has a friend! Big whoop!
C: VINCE
D: No! You don’t get it. This friend can save our fucking asses!
N: NEW FLASHBACK
S: INT. BOSS’S HOUSE - DAY
N: WE SEE VINCE standing outside The Boss’s living room, playing on his phone.
C: VINCE
D: Look. A couple days ago, I’m working The Boss’s place, helping with security. And Mad Martigan comes in to meet The Boss. After a few minutes, she leaves.
E: V.O.
N: Martigan opens the door after the conversation she JUST HAD with The Boss.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Copy that. All good. My bad. I’ll stick around. Thanks for the chat. Cool house.
C: THE BOSS
D: I know, right!!! I mean, the fucking view!!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yep.
N: Martigan leaves. The Boss walks up to Vince.
C: VINCE
D: The Boss comes to me and hands me an address and a photo and says “Look, this is Martigan’s friend. From what we can tell, she’s a civilian. Go get her. Bring her here. Martigan’s getting out of line, I’ve gotta teach her a fucking lesson!” I’m like fucking “Whoa! Crazy!” But you know, whatever, I’m down to clown.
E: V.O.
N: WE SEE Vince sitting in his car eating tacos across the street from a little house in West Hollywood.
C: VINCE
D: So I pull up outside the friend’s place. Nice little bungalow in West Hollywood, close to Guisados. They have insane tacos. The tortilla is thick and soft instead of dry and brittle. If you haven’t tried it, you have to. So I’m finishing up my tacos, listening to “Uptown Funk”, which I fucking love, so I’m, like, a little distracted.
E: V.O.
N: He’s singing along to the song.
C: TIKTOK
D: You know Bruno Mars is half Filipino?
E: V.O.
C: VINCE
D: Of course. Anyway, all of a sudden, WHAM!!!!
E: V.O.
N: He gets NAILED with a TIRE IRON.
C: VINCE
D: I’m fucking out cold. I come to, hours later, I’m fucking bleeding from the head.
E: V.O.
N: WE SEE him come to a few hours later, bloody. He PUKES.
C: VINCE
D: I throw up tacos all over myself from the concussion. I look over to the house, and there’s like, guys from the city there.
E: V.O.
N: The STREET is FLOODING and city workers are there with trucks and machinery trying to figure out how to stop it.
C: VINCE
D: And there’s water all over the road.
E: V.O.
N: WE SEE the workers see Vince, and pull out their phones.
C: VINCE
D: They see me, bleeding from the head, covered in puke, so they call an ambulance and I have to book it out of there fucking asap.
E: V.O.
N: Vince SLAMS the GAS and his car LURCHES forward.
C: VINCE
D: Suddenly, I get super fucking dizzy and puke taco AGAIN! I think I got vertigo or some shit.
E: V.O.
N: We SEE VINCE puke all over himself again, causing him to SWERVE and CLIP one of the workers in the road with his car as he speeds away.
C: VINCE
D: Anyway, turns out Mad Martigan broke a sewer line or something, flooded the street. Her friend, and everyone else on the block has to leave. Staying at hotels and with family and shit. She stashed her somewhere.
E: V.O. beat
N: END FLASHBACK. We’re back in the dark.
C: TIKTOK
D: First, your new nickname is Vertigo Vince.
C: VINCE
D: Don’t you dare-
C: TIKTOK
D: Second, you are officially the worst storyteller ever, man. GET TO THE FUCKING POINT, MAN!
C: VINCE
D: So, don’t you see? Mad Martigan, who doesn’t give a fuck about ANYTHING or ANYONE, clearly cares about this person. It’s a weakness! Her krypto-might.
C: THUG
D: Did you just say krypto-might?
C: VINCE
D: Yeah. I said it wrong.
C: THUG
D: It’s kryptoni-
C: VINCE
D: Yeah, I fucking know! My head’s all foggy!
C: TIKTOK
D: From the vertigo. Vince.
N: Vince shoots TikTok a pissed look.
C: VINCE
D: If we can find where the friend is, we got leverage over Martigan!
E: to the group
N: Harriet nods, seeing the opportunity at hand.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Yes! And then maybe we can get out of here without her killing us all, or The Boss killing us all for you fucking everything up so bad and letting her kill so many of us.
E: to TikTok
C: TIKTOK
D: I’ve fucked up nothing!
C: DUX
D: I saw her toss her purse up onto a balcony when she was leaping for the chandelier. Did you see that shit?
C: THUG
D: Yes! Holy fuck! That was incredible!
C: DUX
D: Truly! I’ve never seen anything like that! It was like some Ninja Warrior shit! But I bet there’s something in there; some thing that can lead us to this friend of hers.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Cyrus The Virus, can you hack in to an Iphone?
C: CYRUS THE VIRUS
D: Easily! I watched a ton of YouTube videos that perfectly tell you exactly how to do it. You use Siri to bypass the-
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Nobody fucking cares, Cyrus. Just be ready to do it.
C: CYRUS THE VIRUS
D: Sure. No prob. Sorry.
N: We push in on MARTIGAN. A look of GENUINE CONCERN sweeps over her.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Fuck...
E: to herself
C: TIKTOK
D: Alright cool, so let’s - Holy SHIT LOOK!!!
N: Tik points out the window and ACROSS the street and all the thugs turn to see Animal SMASHING out of Cole’s window and FALLING to his death. They then look up to see Cole standing by the broken window. Cole notices them staring at him, then RUNS.
C: TIKTOK
D: Fuck me!! That asshole killed Animal! Or Hawk! I can’t tell which! Either way, the other one’s gonna be so sad! Dux, Balki, Spartan, go back up whoever isn’t dead over there!
E: CONT'D to Dux
N: Dux, Spartan and Balki and run out of the room.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: And we should probably go up and look for-
C: TIKTOK
D: Harriet, we’ll go up, look for the bag she tossed. Cyrus the Virus, come with us. Vertigo Vince, and the rest of y’all, keep looking for her. Let’s move.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Fuck.
E: to herself
N: Martigan’s watches TikTok and Harriet RUN out of the room, as Vincent and the remaining thugs continue to search for her. Martigan knows she has to get to her purse before they do. Martigan EYES a STAIRWELL ENTRY across the huge room and starts quietly inching her way toward it. The thugs speak quietly as they continue their search.
C: VINCENT
D: Alright guys, now that boss’s dibs are un-dibbed, I got the new dibs. She’s mine.
N: Vincent turns back to the other thugs and almost spots Martigan, who manages to DUCK behind a pillar just in time.
C: VINCE
D: I’ve fucking hated her for YEARS. And now she’s fucked my head up. Like, bad. I’ve been randomly throwing up ever since she hit me. And I googled it, vertigo can last for years. In rare cases it can be permanent. But... now she has a weakness! And I’m gonna be all up in that shit.
E: beat beat MORE
C: VINCE
D: She wants a new life, but she’s got unfinished business in this one... and his name is ME!
E: CONT'D
N: We PUSH IN on a concerned Martigan. She knows there’s truth in this. The LIGHTER goes out, and she’s once again hidden.
C: THUG
D: Damn. I really hope you get to kill her. Sounds like you really want this.
C: VINCENT
D: Thanks man. I really, really do.
C: THUG
D: I’ll do what I can to help.
C: VINCENT
D: Super nice of you.
N: Martigan continues to cautiously tip toe through the darkness towards the door, making her way towards the next pillar between her and the exit. Then, suddenly, she hears something and freezes: WHOLE LOTTA LOVE by LED ZEPPELIN can be heard playing on a distant radio.
C: VINCENT
D: You guys you hear that?
E: CONT'D
N: All the thugs look towards the sound. Martigan takes the opportunity to make quick and quiet dash toward the exit. She takes one step, when suddenly the HUGE RED NEON “THE WILSHIRE” SIGN from across the street turns ON (due to Cole and the events on pg.23 with the fuse box) and FLOODS the room with RED LIGHT, revealing Martigan standing in the middle of the room to all the thugs.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Well, double fuck.
N: Martigan HURLS her HAMMER, nailing a thug between the eyes. He DROPS, DEAD. The others OPEN FIRE and she RUNS towards the nearest door, DIVING through it and into an adjoining room.
S: INT. THE GALLERIA - 13TH FLOOR - ADJOINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: She spots a TOOL CART. She runs to it and finds a NAIL GUN. She shoots a nail to see if it works. It does. Vincent and the other thugs burst in and she aims her nail gun at them. They aim 5 real guns back at her. Martigan DIVES behind the tool cart and pushing it over as they fire at her. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The metal cart blocks the bullets. Martigan looks and notices the bullets didn’t go through the SLIDING GLASS DOOR behind her either; they’re lodged in the windows, the glass around the bullets spidered slightly. Martigan slides the nail gun towards the door, then stands up and uses the cart like a shield as she backs up. She kicks the cart towards the thugs, picks up the nail gun, and then quickly goes out the sliding door and onto the balcony.
S: EXT. THE GALLERIA - 13TH FLOOR - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
N: Martigan closes the door and then nails it shut behind her. The thugs run to the door shooting at it. Martigan stares right at them as the bullets imbed in the glass. They realize their bullets aren’t going through and try to pull the door open, but they can’t. Martigan runs to the corner of the balcony and peers around the side of the building, looking across and up seven stories towards her APARTMENT BALCONY. The thugs start trying to KICK through the glass door. Martigan presses the nail gun against the glass and FIRES a nail. It punctures the glass, and a THUG’S FOOT.
C: THUG
D: AHHHHHHHH!!!
N: The thug pulls his foot back and falls to the floor clutching it in agony. (NOTE: The glass has a similar consistency to concrete in that bullets cannot penetrate it, but nails can be rammed into it securely.) The thugs watch in shock as Martigan leans over the railing of the balcony, reaches around the corner and begins PUNCHING nails into the glass. She cautiously steps onto the first two nails. They seem to hold her weight. She continues punching nails into the glass and begins to climb diagonally across the exterior of the building and back to her apartment.
C: VINCENT
D: You! Take the stairs! Get ahead of her!
N: One thug peels off and heads towards a staircase. Vincent looks to another thug.
C: VINCENT
D: We follow her out there.
E: CONT'D
C: THUG
D: No fucking way! Are you out of your mind?
C: VINCENT
D: Fuck yeah!
N: Vincent RIPS the entire sliding door off and tosses it aside, then steps onto the balcony, and instantly THROWS UP.
C: THUG
D: Ohhhh! Gross!
C: VINCENT
D: Blagh! You go! Follow her! BLAGH!!!
N: The thug gathers his courage, pulls himself together, and leans around the corner, when Martigan’s POPS a nail into the thug’s head. He makes a strange sound then drops dead. Vincent looks at the remaining THUG.
C: VINCE
D: GO!!
N: The OTHER THUG moves the dead body, tests the first few nails, and then cautiously begins following Martigan along her path of nails.
S: EXT. THE GALLERIA - 16TH FLOOR - EXTERIOR WINDOWS -
N: CONTINUOUS Martigan, using the nail gun, free solos her way across three stories. Through the glass exterior of the building we see the other thugs ascending a staircase, catching up with Martigan. She reaches for the next nail when- BAM! A bullet HITS THE GLASS right in front of her face. She looks at the bullet lodged in the glass; the glass around it has spidered a good deal more then before. She notices the thugs that just shot at her are using a significantly BIGGER GUN.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Uh oh.
N: Suddenly, Martigan is JERKED downwards! She barely manages to hold on and looks down to see the thug climbing after her has grabbed ahold of her ANKLE! The thugs on the other side of the window start SHOOTING at her again, the window cracking ever-further. Suddenly, RIGGS appears behind them, her shoulder dripping with blood, the spear now in her hands. She CHARGES forward and KICKS the window, SHATTERING it and causing Martigan and the thug clutching her ankle to fall backwards. Martigan GRABS Riggs’s ANKLE and tries to pull herself up, but intead Riggs gets pulled out the window with her!
C: RIGGS
D: No! Shit! Fuck! Martigan!
N: Riggs MANCIALLY tries to hold onto the floor she is dragged towards the edge, while the thug holding Martigan’s ankle plummets towards the street below.
C: THUG
D: AHHHHHH!!!!
N: Riggs keeps trying to CLIMB BACK INTO the building, but she can’t. Martigan’s added weight is too much and she can’t shake her loose.
C: RIGGS
D: Let go of me!!!
N: Martigan pops a NAIL through Riggs’s leg and into the glass.
C: RIGGS
D: AHHHHHH!!!
E: CONT'D
N: Martigan starts to climb up Riggs and back into the building. The thugs inside see her and OPEN FIRE, but accidentally HIT Riggs’s unharmed shoulder.
C: RIGGS
D: ARGH!!!!
E: CONT'D
N: She COLLAPSES back in pain, causing both her and Martigan to fall out the window. The NAIL in Rigg’s LEG causes her body to SWING to the side as Martigan grabs on to two nails she’d previously shot into the glass. Martigan continues her climb. Another THUG pops his head out the broken window and AIMS HIS GUN up at the ascending Martigan. She HURLS the nail gun at him, HITTING him in the face.
C: THUG
D: AHHH!
N: He CLUTCHES his nose as blood spurts out. MARTIGAN notices some nearby BULLET HOLES from when the thugs were shooting at her. She reaches down and YANKS a nail out of the window, then SPIKES it into a bullet hole. The THUG, still clutching his nose, BLINDLY starts SHOOTING at Martigan, bullets WHIZZING past her. Martigan reaches a section of the building that is covered in a STRIP of LED screens. She JAMS a nail into one of the LED panel and BREAKS LOOSE! She clutches onto the wall as it FALLS The THUG below wipes blood from his eyes and looks UP to see the LED screen PLUMMETING towards him. He DUCKS back into the building, JUST BARELY AVOIDING the screen. He PEEKS back out, and WHAM, another screen SLAMS into him, sending him and Riggs FALLING to the street below. We see Martigan clutching onto the wall where the LED panels once were.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Nine down. Seven to go.
N: She smiles, then pulls herself atop the STRIP of LED SCREENS, and starts to RUN along them towards her apartment’s balcony.
S: EXT. THE GALLERIA - 20TH FLOOR - MAD MARTIGAN’S APARTMENT -
N: BALCONY - CONTINUOUS She enters the apartment. No one is there. She sees her suitcase and rushes over to it. She grabs a SHOTGUN and a bunch of SHELLS, then RUNS out of the room.
S: EXT. THE GALLERIA - 20TH FLOOR - MAD MARTIGAN’S HALLWAY -
N: CONTINUOUS Martigan runs towards the stairwell as she loads the shells.
S: EXT. THE GALLERIA - 21ST FLOOR - OCEAN THEMED CLUB -
N: CONTINUOUS Martigan cautiously opens the stairwell door and heads down a long white hallway.
C: TIKTOK
D: Fuck.
E: O.S.
N: Martigan moves towards TikTok’s voice.
C: TIKTOK
D: Where the fuck is it?
E: O.S. CONT'D
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: I’m looking, stop yelling at me.
E: O.S.
C: TIKTOK
D: I was talking to myself. And it was rhetorical anyway. Jesus. Stop being so defensive.
E: O.S.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Maybe I’m just being pre-fensive.
E: O.S.
C: TIKTOK
D: Oh shut the fuck up.
E: O.S.
N: Martigan rounds a corner and the full scope of the club is revealed. It’s one huge room, the floor is covered in white tile, the walls are concrete and HUGE GLASS WINDOWS show The Wilshire across the street. At the centre of the room is a giant SHARK TANK filled with small reef-sharks. A school of DOLPHIN SCULPTURES hangs from the ceiling by cables. The floor plays the image of an ocean on a loop. The water interacts when people step on it, as though they are walking on water. And on the far side of the room is TikTok, Harriet, and Cyrus searching for her bag.
C: TIKTOK
D: Look over in that area!
E: CONT'D
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: I already did! Don’t tell me how to look.
N: Martigan she sees her PURSE under a bench across the room. She sneaks along the back of the club and creeps towards the shark tank in the centre. She’s halfway there, when Vincent suddenly BURSTS in through another door.
C: VINCENT
D: She’s coming!!! *gasp* She climbed past us to her *gasp* apartment.
E: extremely out of breathe
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: We can’t find her bag, we- oh shit it’s right there! THERE! THERE!
N: Harriet spots Martigan’s PURSE under an bench across the room. She runs over and GRABS it.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Hah! Her fucking cell phone!
E: CONT'D
N: She pulls out Martigan’s cell. Martigan sees this and is none too happy.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: We gotta unlock it! Cyrus!
E: CONT'D
C: CYRUS THE VIRUS
D: No prob. I just need exactly 3 minutes and 48 seconds.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: No one’s interested in the specifics, Cyrus. Just fucking do it! Jesus! You’re so annoying. This is why we call you Cyrus the Virus.
C: CYRUS THE VIRUS
D: I thought it was because I had Covid twice.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Nope. It’s cause you’re fucking annoying. Hurry up.
N: Martigan cautiously and quietly moves into position to shoot the huddled thugs from behind, planning to kill them all in one fell swoop. IN THE BACKGROUND BEHIND HER, COLE can be seen FLYING OUT of a window in The Wilshire and GRABBING the “FOR LEASE” banner!!! (The events of page 28) Martigan is completely oblivious to this as she gently pulls her gun’s slide back. BEHIND HER, Cole can be seen struggling on the sign. Martigan gently finishing cocking the gun. BEHIND HER, Cole RIPS the FOR LEASE banner as he SWINGS BACK into The Wilshire and out of sight. The banner WILDLY FLAPS as it SOARS away from The Wilshire and towards The Galleria. Martigan RAISES the shotgun, takes AIM, and starts to pull the trigger, when - WHACK!!! The FOR LEASE banner SLAMS into the windows, STARTLING her! TikTok, Harriet and Vince WHIP around and see the distracted Martigan, instantly aiming their guns at her!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Fuck!
N: Martigan starts BLASTING her shotgun wildly as they all shoot at her. It’s MAYHEM. In mere seconds, everyone is out of bullets and for a moment it’s quiet. Martigan slides her fingers in to her BRASS KNUCKLES that are on her vest and CLENCHES her fists by her side.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Gimme back my shit.
E: CONT'D
C: TIKTOK
D: As if! Tell us where your friend is!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: As if.
E: dramatically
N: MARTIGAN hears the sound of them starting to reload; but she has no more bullets! She has no choice but to CHARGE TikTok, Harriet, and Vince.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: RAAAHHHHH!!!
E: CONT'D
N: She LEAPS out and RUSHES the thugs. She HURLS the empty shotgun at Harriet, who manages to dodge it. She uses her brass knuckle to PUNCH TikTok and Vincent’s guns out of their hands, but Harriet manages to load hers! Martigan THROWS her left BRASS KNUCKLE at Harriet and it NAILS her in the NOSE. She drops her gun and CLUTCHES her bloody nose.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Awb! Fub!!
N: TikTok rushes in with Vincent and TACKLES Martigan. The three of them GRAPPLE on the ground. Martigan is BEATING both of them, landing BRUTAL blows with her right hand, the BRASS KNUCKLES hurting whatever they hit!
C: TIKTOK
D: Goddamnit!!!
N: Vince SWINGS to PUNCH Martigan in the face, but she PUNCHES him in the fist with her brass knuckles.
C: VINCE
D: FUCK! My hand!!!!
N: Harriet RUNS up and tries to KICK Martigan in the face, but Martigan PUNCHES her in the FOOT with her brass knuckle.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: AHHH!!!
N: Harriet SWINGS again wildly at Martigan, but she moves, and Harriet HITS Tiktok in the face.
C: TIKTOK
D: Ah! Fuck!
N: Martigan WRIGGLES out and CHARGES towards Cyrus!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Gimme my fuckin’ phone!
N: She delivers a BRUTAL PUNCH to the side of Cyrus’ head, knocking him OUT COLD. She’s reaches to GRAB her phone from his limp hand when Vince GRABS her ankle and YANKS her back. They GRAPPLE.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Cyrus the Virus is out cold! Let’s get him out of here! Come on!!
C: VINCE
D: I got her! Go!!!
N: Tiktok and Harriet LIFT up Cyrus and drag him out of the room as Vince and Martigan roll around trading punches. The gigantic Vince manages to GRAB Martigan’s neck and HOISTS her off the ground, CHOKING HER! Martigan STRUGGLES to break free but CAN’T!!! She PUNCHES him in the HEAD with her brass knuckles. Blood spurts from Vince’s forehead, but he holds onto her throat, tightening his grip. She SWINGS again, but Vince GRABS her hand and PULLS off the brass knuckles, THROWING them across the room.
C: VINCE
D: I can’t fucking believe it. I got you. Haha!! Your luck’s run out! I fucking got you!!!
E: CONT'D
N: She DESPERATELY HOLDS on to Vince’s ARM to help support her weight and stop from passing out.
C: VINCE
D: You gave me vertigo you fucking asshole. That shit can last years!
E: CONT'D
N: He SQUEEZES HARDER. She’s starting to black out.
C: VINCE
D: I’ve thrown up nineteen times since yesterday! NINETEEN TIMES!!!
E: CONT'D
N: She GRITS her teeth, then RIPS one of her POINTY EARRINGS out of her ear lobe and STABS VINCE IN THE EYE WITH IT! He steps back in agony.
C: VINCE
D: ARGH!!!!!
E: CONT'D
N: Martigan DOUBLE KICKS Vince in the chest, sending him stumbling backwards and IMPALING him on a LARGE CORAL ART PIECE. His body goes limp. Martigan, GASPING to regain her breath, slowly rises to her feet, walks over to Vince’s body, and gets in his face.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Shouldn’t have fucked with my friend, Vertigo Vince.
N: Martigan spits in his face, when he suddenly SPRINGS TO LIFE and GRASPS her wrist! She pulls back, but he holds tight. Vince, as well as the art piece he is impaled on, TOPPLE forward, PINNING Martigan to the floor. Vince lies on top of her with HUNDREDS of pounds of corral art sculpture pressing down on him as the simulated water on the floor flows around them.
C: VINCE
D: GAHHH!!!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: RRGGHGHHH!!!
N: The sharp piece of corral slowly pushing through him and towards Martigan’s STOMACH.
C: VINCE
D: Hah... you’re gonna lose. And we’re gonna hack into your phone... and we’re gonna find your friend... and we’re gonna kill her. And it’s all your fault. I win, Martigan! I WIN!
E: beat
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: You’re not winning, you’re literally dying.
N: Vince smiles.
C: VINCE
D: This is straight up the greatest moment of my life.
N: Vince dies, and we push in on Martigan’s as the truth of his words destroy her. For maybe the first time in her life, she is truly overcome with regret. As Vince’s body goes fully limp, the coral shard slides CLOSER to Martigan’s stomach. She tries to push Vince off of her, but he barely budges. The SHARD begins to CUT her skin.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: No, no, no...
N: She looks for some way to get out from under him as the shard inches DEEPER.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Ahh.... FUCK!
E: CONT'D
N: She sees Vince has a GRENADE clipped to his belt. She looks UP at the OVERHANGING DOLPHIN SCULPTURES, eyes the WIRES holding them up, and then looks to the LARGE, CRACKED SHARK TANK. Martigan looks to Vince’s grenade, determined. She reaches for it... but it’s JUST out of her grasp! The SHARD is sinking DEEPER!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: AHH!!!
E: CONT'D
N: She can’t reach it. On the verge of losing hope... Martigan gets an idea. She unlatches her diamond “BFF” bracelet, and uses it as a little fishing hook. It LATCHES around the CLIP of the GRENADE!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yes!
E: CONT'D
N: She PULLS the bracelet, which SLIDES the grenade out of Vince’s belt and in to her hand! She pulls the pin with her thumb, and FLINGS the grenade over Vince. KABOOM! The grenade explodes, causing a WIRE to SNAP that SWINGS one of the dolphin scultpures downward. It WHIZZES PAST Martigan and CRASHES into the SHARK TANK, completely SHATTERING IT!!! SPLASH!!! A small tidal wave PUSHES out from the shark tank in every directions, WASHING across the lobby. Martigan holds her breath as the wave HITS her, PUSHING both the sculpture and Vince OFF of her. A soaking wet Martigan STANDS up, a SMALL SHARK biting her shoulder. She RIPS the shark off and tosses it on the ground. She puts her BFF bracelet back on, and looks down to her stomach, which is leaking BLOOD. She grunts, pushes the pain aside, and runs out of the club.
S: INT. GALLERIA - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Martigan hurries down a hall, looking for her enemies. She HEARS voices and peers around a corner, seeing a large area still under construction. There’s no WALLS or WINDOWS; the entire floor is completely OPEN to the outside. A small crane is mounted near the edge. She sees TikTok and Harriet standing over Cyrus’s unconscious body. Marigan sees a nearby piece of REBAR and quietly picks it up.
C: TIKTOK
D: Shit. He’s out cold! Cyrus!!! Wake the fuck up!
N: Tik starts SLAPPING Cyrus in the face hard.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Not so hard! You’re gonna make it worse! Like this:
N: Harriet gives him little slaps in the face. He comes to.
C: CYRUS THE VIRUS
D: What?! Huh?!
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Alright! You’re up! Do your thing!
C: CYRUS THE VIRUS
D: Huh? What? Where am I? What thing?
C: TIKTOK
D: Fuck! He’s concussed!
C: CYRUS THE VIRUS
D: Harriet?! What’s happening?!
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Cyrus! We’re in the middle of a terrible situation and you need to hack this cell phone!
C: CYRUS THE VIRUS
D: I can do that! I watched a YouTube video that-
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: We fucking know! Get to it!
N: Cyrus, confused but trying to focus, gets to work on the phone.
C: TIKTOK
D: Stop giving orders! I’m the leader!
E: to Harriet
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Listen, TikTok-
C: TIKTOK
D: Don’t call me that, I-
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: We all call you that! Accept it! It’s actually a pretty fucking cool nickname on the grand scale of things!
C: TIKTOK
D: Easy for you to say! You’re Harriet The Spy!
C: HARRIET
D: I can’t help it that my name is Harriet and I was a spy and your claim to fame is you killed some asshole on Tiktok! That’s on YOU! And yes, I’m telling Cyrus here what we SHOULD fucking be doing right now, ‘cause I know better than you! I’ll guard him while he hacks in to the phone. You go check on Vince, see if he killed her or not. And if he didn’t keep hunting her ass. Got it?!
C: TIKTOK
D: Alright, I’m conceding: it is a pretty cool nickname, and it is a solid plan. I’m off!
N: TikTok runs off. Cyrus continues to fiddle with the phone as Harriet keeps watch.
C: CYRUS THE VIRUS
D: Hah! That was easier than it even looked online. I did it!
N: WHACK! Harriet gets SMOKED in the head by flying piece of REBAR.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: AHH!! FUCK!! Again?!?!
N: She drops to the ground, CLUTCHING her head.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: RRRAARRR!!!
N: Cyrus sees Martigan CHARGING towards him. BAM! She SHOULDER CHECKS him so HARD that he drops her PHONE on the ground and FALLS over the EDGE and to his death.
C: CYRUS THE VIRUS
D: AHHHHHHHHH!!!!
E: O.S.
N: She looks over the side of the building, and then looks ACROSS THE STREET and sees Cole, ground level, getting in her RED MERCEDES.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Again with this asshole. That’s my car, man!
N: She looks beside her and sees a CONTROL PANEL for a CRANE that is holding some large girders a few stories above her car. She eyes the position of the car, then goes to the control panel and HITS a button. The load falls, CRASHING to the ground in front of Cole and BARRICADING her car in place. She watches as Cole HOPS out of the car, just as Hawk runs out of the lobby of The Wilshire, towards Cole. Cole hauls ass towards The Galleria’s construction yard. BLAM! A SHOT HITS MARTIGAN IN THE BACK, nailing her VEST, and BLOWING a CHUNK out of her ponytail! She falls onto the ground, bits of her hair raining down around her, and looks back to see Harriet running towards her, about to fire again! Martigan spots the rebar she threw at Harriet; she picks it up and WHIPS it at her. The rebar SLIDES along the ground and takes out Harriet’s feet! Harriet SLAMS onto the ground and loses her gun, which SLIDES straight towards Martigan. Martigan picks up the GUN, Harriet picks up the REBAR. Martigan shoots as Harriet throws. The bullet CLIPS Harriet’s SHOULDER as the rebar KNOCKS the gun out of Martigan’s hand, sending it over the edge of the building.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Good throw.
E: CONT'D
N: Harriet smiles and CHARGES. They collide and fight hand-to- hand!!! Harriet can’t get the upper hand on Martigan, so she resorts to TACKLING her towards the edge of the building! Just as they BOTH go over the edge and to their certain deaths- -COLE PASSES BY (facing away from them) on top of a construction elevator! (from page 31) He ZIPS past as Harriet and Martigan land in the HOLD of the SAME elevator Cole’s on top of! (They are OBLIVIOUS to each others presence)
S: INT. CONSTRUCTION ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
N: Martigan and Harriet viciously battle inside the ascending elevator, SLAMMING each other back and forth against the caged walls. Martigan KICKS Harriet into an ELECTRIC PANEL. Sparks fly out of the panel and the elevator immediately reverses direction and starts to DESCEND. Harriet uses the momentum to leap onto Martigan, gaining the upper hand, when she is momentarily distracted by the sound of footsteps running along the roof of the elevator. Martigan takes the opportunity to PUNCH Harriet in the face. The elevator grinds to a STOP and the two FACE OFF.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Who the fuck are you anymore?!? What happened to you?! I thought we were scorpions! Like in the story! Killers by nature. We don’t change and we don’t wanna fucking change. That’s why we got drunk that night and got these stupid scorpion tattoos! I mean, fuck!
N: Harriet shows her scorpion tattoo.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: We don’t have to be scorpions!
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Of course we do! That’s literally the whole point of the fucking story!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: No. We don’t. Because we’re not fucking bugs or arachnids or whatever scorpions are! We’re humans! We can change! We can evolve. Like butterflies!
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Those are bugs too!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I’m just fucking saying!
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: I am what I am. And you are what you are. This friend of yours... does she even know you? What you are? What you do?
E: beat
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: She knows the me I want to be.
N: Harriet chuckles.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Just ‘cause you want to be something, doesn’t mean you are.
N: BOOM!!!!! One of the other construction elevators SMASHES into their TRACK, knocking the whole thing over. It starts to topple and they SLAM against the elevator cageas wall as it pivots from vertical to HORIZONTAL!!! Harriet FALLS on top of Martigan and starts CHOKING HER. The ELELVATOR starts to slide HORIZONTALLY. Martigan looks and sees that the track is BROKEN up a ahead; the elevator is going to SLIDE OFF in a matter of moments!!! As the elevator picks up speed, Martigan takes a BIG SIP from her Camelback and SPITS WATER in Harriet’s face. It buys Martigan a split second; she HEAD BUTTS Harriet, knocking her back on her ass. Martigan notices the elevator nearing the end of the broken track. She spots an apartment BALCONY rapidly approaching. It’s her only chance to get off before the elevator plummets to the ground. She ROLLS out of the elevator JUST as it passes the open balcony. She lands safely on it, leaving Harriet alone on the elevator as it FLIES off the track. Suddenly, Harriet LEAPS out, SOARS through the air, and GRABS onto the side of the building as the elevator CRASHES down to the ground, SMASHING into peices. Martigan walks to the edge of the balcony, and sees Harriet below her, struggling to hold on. She’s too far to help. And her grip is slipping. Martigan stares down at Harriet, then has an idea. She takes off her Camelbak ties one end of it’s NYLON WAIST STRAP to a SUPPORT BEAM. She wraps the other end around her WRIST and then carefully lowers herself over the edge and REACHES her hand out to Harriet. Harriet looks up at Martigan, angry.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Just take my hand. Come on. Please.
E: beat
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Fuck. Fine! How humiliating.
N: Harriet looks into Martigan’s eyes and softens, then reaches up and GRABS hold of her hand. Martigan uses all her strength to PULL Harriet up.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Alright, now just-
N: Harriet PULLS out a small KNIFE and STABS Martigan in the shoulder!
C: HARRIET
D: HAHAH!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Argh!! Fuck! I’m trying to save you! Why did you do that?!
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: I had to try!
N: Martigan tries to hold on, but the blood from Harriet stabbing her has dripped down her arm and made her hand too slippery. Harriet’s hand slides out. Martigan sadly watches as Harriet fearlessly FALLS to her death, with not so much as a single scream. She lands in the back of the FLATBED TRUCK filled with PINK INSULTION FOAM. Martigan takes a moment, then notices Hawk, in the BUCKET of the boom lift, making his way up to the TOP of the building.
S: EXT. THE GALLERIA - ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS
N: Martigan BURSTS out onto the roof. She starts searching the roof. She walks around a large AC unit and sees Cole 50ft away, on his knees and clutching his phone, and Hawk holding a gun to his head. They’re too far for her to get there in time. Martigan sees a SMALL TV SATELLITE DISH bolted into the ground. She GRABS onto it and pulls. The bolts loosen but don’t give. She looks back at Hawk, who is clearly ramping up to a dramatic last line before he kills Cole. She PULLS at the satellite with all her strength and RIPS it out. Hawk’s finger starts to pull down on the trigger. Martigan GRASPS the satellite like a giant discus, SPINS around and HURLS it towards Hawk. It SOARS through the air and NAILS him in the side of the head, IMBEDDING into his skull AND SNAPPING his neck. BANG! Hawk’s hand errantly shoots as he dies, the bullet narrowly missing Cole’s face!
C: COLE
D: AHHHHH!!!
N: Cole sees Hawk is dead and then looks over to see Martigan moving towards him.
C: COLE
D: Holy shit! Holy shit! That was close! Thank you! Thank you so much! Whoooo. Whoa. It’s YOU! The lady. You’re okay!
E: CONT'D looking at Martigan
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yeah. I’m spectacular.
C: COLE
D: You saved me!? Thank you!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yeah, no problem.
C: COLE
D: Oh my god! They say your life flashes before your eyes, and like, for REAL, that shit was like PHOOM! I’m learning to ride a bike! PHOOM- I pissed my pants in Bar Mitzvah class! PHOOM-
E: in shock
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Just shut the fuck up! Listen, was there anyone else chasing you? Anyone else alive? You kill anyone?
C: COLE
D: Um, yeah, a few, I guess. I killed that dude’s twin brother, and a scary tattooed guy, and a motorcycle guy. Jesus Christ. I killed three people! Oh fuck!
N: Cole can’t believe the sentence he just said.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: 13 out of 16.
N: She takes Hawk’s gun.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: So... who the fuck are you?
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: I’m just a guy! I work in the building across the way... and I saw you getting attacked... and I just couldn’t let that happen without trying to stop it.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Nobody taught you to mind your own fucking business?
C: COLE
D: I thought I was helping!!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Well, you weren’t, asshole! What’s your name?
E: beat
C: COLE
D: ... Dan.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Alright, Dan. Are you a “call the cops” kind of guy, or a “get the fuck away from here and mind my own business and never speak of this again” kind of guy?
C: COLE
D: I’m definitely the second one.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Good.
N: They step on a SERVICE ELEVATOR and start to descend.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: If you actually wanna help me, you’ll get to steppin’. Get as far away from this place as you can. And if you ever mention a word of this to anyone, I’m gonna find you and fuck your dumb ass up, copy?
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: Copy.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Alright.
N: Suddenly, the FORKS of a forklift SMASH in to the elevator through the door.
C: COLE FAYE
D: AHHHH!!! FUCK!!!
N: The elevator JERKS to a stop, knocking Martigan and Cole off their feet. The forks PULL OUT, and then a moment later they PIERCE through again, STABBING just ABOVE Martigan and Cole’s heads. The forks pull back and RIP the elevator DOORS off with them! They see a THUG in the driver’s seat of a FORKLIFT; he WHIPS out his GUN and starts shooting at them.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Run!!!!
N: Her and Cole RUN out of the elevator and past the forklift. The thug turns the forklift around and starts chasing them across a large unfinished space. Martigan points to a DOORWAY leading to another room.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: There!!
E: CONT'D
N: They RUN for the door as the forklift bears down on them. In the NICK of time they DIVE through the door, but-
S: INT. THE GALLERIA - PARKING STRUCTURE - CONTINUOUS
N: - the forklift just SMASHES through the wall behind them. The FLOOR below them gives out! They land one floor below, in the PARKING STRUCTURE. The FORKLIFT is stuck above them, wedged in the debris. Cole and Martigan are pinned under RUBBLE.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Fuck!
C: COLE
D: OWWWWW!!!
N: The thug sees them below and RAISES the FORKS on the lift, which LOWERS the entire forklift towards Martigan and Cole. The SPINNING TREADS come closer and closer, one over Martigan and one over Cole!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Grab them!!!!!
N: Right before they’re CRUSHED, Martigan and Cole GRAB the spinning treads, which YANKS them out from under the rubble and EJECTS them in front of the forklift! Martigan lands like a hero as Cole flops to the ground next to her. Behind them, the forklift CRASHES down in a heap, killing the driver. Martigan points to a CAR parked near some equipment.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: There!
E: CONT'D
N: They run towards it.
C: COLE
D: I can hotwire this.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: You can?
N: They get in and he starts.
C: COLE
D: Uh... yeah. Long story.
N: The ENGINE ROARS to life - when an EXCAVATOR crushes the back of the car. It DRIVES forwards, CRUSHING the car like a toothpaste tube.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Get on the floor!!
N: They’re pinned! And slowly being crushed! Then - Martigan finds herself face to face with the GEAR SHIFT. She SLAMS IT IN TO REVERSE.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Go!
E: CONT'D
N: Cole SLAMS his HAND on the GAS and the car, with the EXCAVATOR ON IT, LURCHES BACKWARDS. The excavator gets caught on a LOW part of the ceiling and the car comes out from under it, but flies off the side of a parking aisle, getting wedged over a huge DROP BELOW. The THUG operating the excavator sees and MOVES the arm down towards the car. Martigan and Cole LEAP from the car and GRAB the ARM of the excavator JUST as it slams down on the car, sending it tumbling into the darkness below. Cole SLIPS and Martigan GRABS HIS HAND. She PULLS him up to the arm of the excavator and then they both scramble up the arm and JUMP onto the floor ABOVE the one they started on.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Holy fuck! Good job!
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: Thank you!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Hah. You’re not totally useless!
C: COLE
D: Thank you so much! Jesus!
S: INT. THE GALLERIA - PARKING STRUCTURE - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole follows Martigan into the pitch black parking garage. As they walk AUTOMATIC LIGHTS go on above them, tracking their movement through the darkness.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Alright, we’re injured an unarmed, outnumbered, and they’re gaining on us fast. All we have is the element of surprise.
N: She starts to take off her vest as she walk towards a pillar and stands behind it. The automatic lights don’t detect her in that spot and the area around her goes very dark. She motions for Cole to get behind one a few feet away and he does. The lights above him go out. And then, in the deep background, automatic lights start activating, following TikTok and the thugs as they APPROACH.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Here.
E: CONT'D whispering
N: Martigan throws her bullet proof vest to Cole.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Put on that vest.
E: CONT'D
N: Cole starts putting on the vest. It’s EXTREMELY tight on him.
C: COLE
D: Jesus Christ this is tight.
E: whispering
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: It’ll still stop bullets. That’s what really matters.
N: Cole is alarmed by this sentence.
C: COLE
D: Wait what? What’s the plan exactly?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Simple. You run like hell in that direction screaming like a maniac, and I’ll jump ‘em from behind and kill ‘em all.
N: TikTok and his guys continue towards Martigan and Cole.
C: COLE
D: But.... they’ll shoot at me.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Exactly. That’s why I gave you the vest.
C: COLE
D: What if they shoot at my arms or feet or face?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: The vest is brightly colored so it’ll draw their fire. You’ll be fine.
C: COLE
D: No I won’t!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: You wanna kill these motherfuckers while I run away? Cause we can switch if you want!
C: COLE
D: No!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Exactly! Now shut the fuck up and get ready to haul ass. Zig and zag. It’ll actually help a lot.
N: Cole is overwhelmed with concern. This plan does NOT sound good to him.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Alright, they’re almost here. You ready?
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: Uh...
N: Cole is definitely not ready.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Alright. It’s do or die time. Any second now.
N: We push in on Cole’s increasing anxiety.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: 10, 9, 8...
E: CONT'D
N: Martigan, making constant eye contact with Cole, continues to silently mouth the numbers. Cole is BREATHING HARD. FREAKING OUT. He can’t take it anymore.
C: COLE
D: I’m so, so sorry.
N: Martigan looks at him confused.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: For what?
C: COLE
D: Please don’t hate me.
N: He pulls Martigan’s UNLOCKED PHONE out of the vest pocket.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: For what? What the fuck are you doing?
N: He takes out the PINK PIECE OF PAPER from earlier and DIALS THE NUMBER. We HEAR TIKTOK’S PHONE RINGING down the aisle. He answers.
C: TIKTOK
D: Hello?
E: into phone
C: COLE
D: Hello! Zac!
E: into phone
N: Martigan’s eyes go wide at the name Zac.
C: TIKTOK
D: Yeah.
E: into phone
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: What the fuck?!
E: whispering to Cole
C: COLE
D: I just can’t do this plan! It’s me! The lookout! I’m hiding behind a pillar near you and I’m gonna come out so don’t shoot me!
E: whispering to Martigan into phone
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: What?!?! You fucking dick!
E: whispering to Cole
C: COLE
D: I’m sorry! I’M COMING OUT! PLEASE DON’T SHOOT! I’m just trying to get out of here alive! I’M COMING OUT!
E: whispering to Martigan into phone whispering to Martigan yelling
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Fuck you!
E: angry, whispering
C: COLE
D: Good luck! DON’T SHOOT!!!
E: whispering to Martigan yelling
C: TIKTOK
D: Hold your fire!
E: to the thugs
N: Cole stands up with his hands high in the air and steps out from behind the pillar. The automatic lights above him TURN ON. TikTok and the thugs aim their guns at Cole’s.
C: TIKTOK
D: You’re the lookout?!
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: Yes! I work for The Boss! My name is Cole Markowitz. I got posted across the street yesterday, stakin’ out this safehouse. I was supposed to text if anyone showed up! And some lady did, so I did! And then everything went nuts!! Please don’t kill me! I’m on your team!!
N: ANGLE ON: Martigan, still hiding behind a pillar in the darkness.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Fucking asshole.
E: furious, to herself
N: BACK ON: Cole and Tik.
C: TIKTOK
D: Holy shit. Well, you were texting with me, yo! I’m Tiktok, the assasin formerly known as Zac.
E: owning it owning it
N: Tiktok lowers his gun, much to Cole’s relief
C: THUG
D: She’s still out there, Tik.
C: TIKTOK
D: I know! Stay crispy, guys.
C: THUG
D: Frosty.
C: TIKTOK
D: Whatever.
N: The THUGS AIM their guns in all directions, scanning for Madeline.
C: TIKTOK
D: You stole Ryan Seacrest’s Maserati for The Boss’s birthday, right?
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: Yeah! Exactly!
N: Martigan cringes, clearly aware of the Seacrest incident.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: That motherfucker... I knew I’d seen him before. You stupid idiot!
E: to herself
C: TIKTOK
D: Wait a minute...
N: He raises his gun again and AIMS it at Cole’s face.
C: TIKTOK
D: ... Why the fuck did you point a gun at my chest!
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: It wasn’t a gun! It was a level, like for hanging paintings and shit! And... Uh... I was just... uh...
C: TIKTOK
D: Were you trying to warn us?! About the trap?!
C: COLE
D: Uh... yeah, exactly! My phone died, and I didn’t know what else to do!
N: Tik starts to lower the gun, but then remembers something and lifts it back up to Cole’s face.
C: TIKTOK
D: Wait, but then why’d you kill Hawk?
C: COLE
D: He gassed me and I couldn’t speak! I kept trying to explain but he wouldn’t let me! It was self defense!
C: TIKTOK
D: Yeah I totally get that. That motherfucker was never a good listener. He’s a real “shoot first, ask questions later” kinda dude. Or, was anyway. Well then-
E: beat
N: TikTok lowers his gun and offers Cole his hand.
C: TIKTOK
D: -nice to meet you in person, Cole.
E: CONT'D
N: Martigan watches in rage as Cole takes TikToks hand.
C: TIKTOK
D: We’re in quite the sitch, brosef. Facing off against THE Mad Martigan.
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: Wait, what? That’s who that is?!
N: Cole clearly knows her reputation and is shocked that’s who she is. He resists looking towards the pillar Martigan is behind. ANGLE ON Martigan, listening with great concern. We cut back to Cole and Tiktok.
C: TIKTOK
D: Yeah. She’s been killing the fuck outta my team and there’s only a few of us left. But looks like now we got one more! Welcome!
C: COLE
D: Cool. Thanks.
C: TIKTOK
D: Whoa... is that Martigan’s f-in’ vest?!
N: Cole nods.
C: TIKTOK
D: Gimme, gimme!
E: CONT'D
N: Cole takes it off and hands it to Tiktok, who immediately starts rummaging through the pockets.
C: COLE
D: Yeah. She took it off at one point and I just snatched it from her and ran like hell.
C: TIKTOK
D: Do you know where she is now?
N: Cole can’t help but glance towards where Martigan is hiding. She grits her teeth, ready to spring out and make the best of it.
C: COLE
D: Uh... no. No idea. What are you looking for?
C: TIKTOK
D: Her phone.
C: COLE
D: Oh, uh-
N: He holds up the phone.
C: TIKTOK
D: No f-in’ way. You got her phone? YES!!!
N: TikTok KISSES Cole on the cheek.
C: TIKTOK
D: You beautiful man, you! And it’s still unlocked! Cyrus the Virus didn’t die in vain! This is a borderline miracle. Fuck. Alright...
E: CONT'D
N: TikTok starts scrolling through Martigan’s emails.
C: TIKTOK
D: ...there! YASS KING! That’s it. An air b&b receipt. Hah! I got the address!
E: CONT'D
N: ANGLE ON: Martigan, EXTREMELY concerned.
C: TIKTOK
D: Boss!! Harriet fucked up the whole plan and now she’s dead and Martigan got away, BUT, I found where she stashed the friend!!! 2201 Los Feliz!
E: CONT'D on the phone
N: Martigan’s overcome with dread. Her worst fear is being realized. TikTok attentively listens to The Boss for a moment.
C: TIKTOK
D: Ten minutes?! Perfect! Thank you, Boss! I do my best. That’s very kind of you. Oh, wow. I really, really appreciate you saying that. It’s been a hell of a night!
E: CONT'D on the phone
N: He tosses the phone back to Cole.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Oh no.
E: to herself
N: She knows she doesn’t have a second to lose; she has to get to Naomi first. She throws caution to the wind and breaks out into a MAD SPRINT towards the EXIT of the parking structure. The ceiling lights rapidly activate as she runs, ILLUMINATING her every move!!
C: THUG
D: Tik, look!
C: TIKTOK
D: SHOOT HER!!!
N: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! They narrowly miss her as she runs out of a driveway and onto the street. Tik turns to Cole and the thugs.
C: TIKTOK
D: Come on! Let’s get her!!!
E: CONT'D
N: Tiktok and the thugs CHASES Martigan as Cole reluctantly follows.
S: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: Martigan BOLTS out on to the street. She runs to her RED MERCEDES but it’s boxed in by one of the thug’s SUVs and the GIRDERS that SHE dropped in front of it earlier to stop Cole from driving off with it.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: FUCK!!!!!
N: She SEES one of the SUV’s has been DAMAGED by the girders. She opens the door and is able to JAM it into neutral. She starts to PUSH it out of the way, FREEING her Mercedes. BANG!! A shot WHIZZES past her! Tik and the TWO THUGS are shoot as they run towards her, Cole right behind them. Martigan RUNS towards The Wilshire, and DUCKS behind a DUMPSTER that has ORANGE CONSTRUCTION NETTING hanging around it. BANG! BANG!! Bullets ricochet off the dumpster.
C: TIKTOK
D: There! She’s hiding there! She’s unarmed!!
E: O.S.
N: Then, Martigan HEARS something. The RUMBLING of an engine... She looks and sees that beside her is SPARTAN’s MOTORCYCLE, TANGLED UP and DANGLING in the construction netting beside her, engine running. Martigan SMILES. ANGLE ON: Tik, the thugs, and Cole cautiously approaching the dumpster they know Martigan is behind.
C: TIKTOK
D: Get ready guys! This is it! We fucking got her ass this ti-
E: CONT'D
N: VROOOM!!!!! Martigan RIPS OUT from behind the dumpster on the back of Spartan’s motorcycle! Tik, Cole, and the thugs all DIVE out of the way as Martigan SPEEDS DOWN THE BLOCK.
C: TIKTOK
D: Holy FUCK she so’s good!!! She’s gonna try to make it to her friend before the other guys get there. We gotta stop her, or the Boss’ll be so fucking pissed! Anyone have the keys to the SUV’s?
E: CONT'D to the guys
N: The thugs SHAKE their heads.
C: TIKTOK
D: You! Cole! GTA! Can you hot wire that Mercedes?
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: ... yeah.
C: TIKTOK
D: 2201 Los Feliz! Let’s move!!!
N: They HOP in the car and DRIVE OFF. We HOLD a moment, then see TWO FEET, covered in PINK INSULATION FOAM step in to frame...
S: EXT. LA STREETS - NIGHT
N: Martigan SPEEDS through the streets of LA on the motorcycle, weaving through traffic. BEHIND HER, we see the RED MERCEDES fishtail around a corner and SPEED after her.
S: INT. RED MERCEDES - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole drives, TikTok is in the passenger seat, and the two thugs are in the back.
C: TIKTOK
D: Shit my man. You’re a tight fucking driver.
C: COLE
D: Thanks.
N: Cole WEAVES through traffic, following Martigan.
C: COLE
D: So... um... what exactly is happening here?
E: CONT'D
C: TIKTOK
D: Martigan tried to quit, The Boss said no, Martigan went nuts, lured us all in to a trap, and now we’re gonna use her friend to make her give herself up.
C: COLE
D: Who’s the friend?
C: TIKTOK
D: Some fuckin’ normie-ass-civie.
N: We see Cole is RIDDLED WITH GUILT and self loathing.
C: COLE
D: So... the plan is to kill the friend and Martigan?
C: TIKTOK
D: Yeah! Unless Martigan gets there first and fucks it all up! So you stay on her ass!
N: Martigan, on her motorcycle, has an easier time WEAVING through traffic, but Cole, truly an impressive driver, manages to keep up. ANGLE ON: Martigan. She looks back and sees Cole and TikTok in her Mercedes. She JAMS the throttle and SPEEDS off.
C: TIKTOK
D: Keep on her, man! Fuck!
E: CONT'D
N: Cole RIPS it into high gear.
C: TIKTOK
D: Nice! Damn! This is almost scary! Like... I wanna say slow down, but I know we shouldn’t!
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: Yeah... as a car thief you gotta know a lot about cars.
C: TIKTOK
D: I’d imagine. I know a lot about guns and knives and stuff.
C: COLE
D: Safety features, things like that.
C: TIKTOK
D: Turn left here! We’re getting close!
E: looking at his GPS to the Thugs
C: COLE
D: Like this Mercedes for example. The cage around the engine is so rigid, you can crash at around 50 miles an hour and the car will still drive after. And you’d be relatively unhurt, too.
C: TIKTOK
D: Um... okay? Who gives a fuck?!
N: They SEE Martigan pulling up outside a HOUSE, she HOPS off the motorcycle and starts making her way towards the door. Cole puts on his SEATBELT. Nobody else in the car is wearing one.
C: COLE
D: ... as long as you’re wearing your seatbelt.
N: Cole JERKS THE WHEEL!!!
S: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE NAOMI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Martigan is on Naomi’s front lawn, when she hears a loud SCREECH and looks up to see her RED MERCEDES very DELIBERATELY drive HEAD FIRST into a LAMP POST! CRASH!!! Tiktok is VIOLENTLY EJECTED out the front windshield! He FLIES 20 feet through the air and SLAMS into a FIRE HYDRANT, bending him like a rag doll. He is VERY dead.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Holy shit.
N: She approaches the car and sees the two thugs DEAD in the back seat and Cole in the driver’s seat, roughed up but relatively okay.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: You alright?
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: Yeah...
E: groggy
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: You did that on purpose, right?
C: COLE
D: Yeah. I want to help.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: The lookout, huh?
C: COLE
D: Yeah. Again, I’m so sorry.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: It’s alright. Get out.
N: Cole STUMBLES out. People are starting to come out of their houses to see what’s happening. Martigan leads them away from the wreck and towards Naomi’s AirBNB.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Okay, we’re gonna get my friend out of here now before The Boss’s goon squad shows up. Here’s the story. You’re my cousin. Distant. And you have a friend who works at the Four Seasons who’s giving us a suite for the night, and we’re gonna go there now and enjoy it. Right away.
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: Sure. Cool. Where am I from?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Michigan.
C: COLE
D: No, Saskatchewan!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Fine, who fucking cares? You’re from Saskatchewan.
C: COLE
D: Why do we look all fucked up?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: We play competitive paintball together.
E: annoyed
C: COLE
D: Yes! Part of my newfound sobriety.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Ohh, that’s good. You’ve recently turned your life around. From a pornography addiction.
C: COLE
D: Can it be gambling?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Nope. Not your vibe.
C: COLE
D: My vibe is porn?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: One thousand percent.
N: Martigan knocks on the door. After a moment, Naomi answers.
C: NAOMI
D: Madeline!
E: excited
N: Then, the color drains from her face.
C: NAOMI
D: Cole?
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: Naomi?
C: NAOMI
D: What... how do you two know each other?! What the fuck is happening?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Uh...
C: NAOMI
D: What is happening?!!!
C: COLE
D: Uh...
E: shocked
C: NAOMI
D: Spit it out! What’s happening?!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: You know her?
E: to Cole
C: NAOMI
D: Oh, fuck this.
N: Naomi goes inside and SLAMS the door. Martigan tries to open it, but it’s LOCKED. She turns to Cole, who is in SHOCK.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: What’s going on?!
C: COLE
D: That’s my ex-wife!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: What?!
C: COLE
D: That’s my ex-wife!!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Oh fuck.
C: COLE
D: Well where the hell did you meet her?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: ...outside of court. The day you got sentenced. We were both there... because of you! I KNEW I knew your face from somewhere. I was there to make sure you didn’t cop a plea. Then... I met her outside when I was walking to my car. She never talks about you.
E: mind blown beat MORE
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: She fucking hates you. Naomi! Please open up! It’s important!!
E: CONT'D yelling
C: NAOMI
D: Fuck off!!!
E: O.S. through door
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I’m gonna break the door down.
E: to Cole
N: She takes a few steps back.
C: COLE
D: Why did you drag her in to this shit?? Why did you stash her here if you knew they were looking for her?! Why didn’t you get her out of the fucking city?!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Because I couldn’t come up with a story that would make her do that, and I didn’t want to tell her who I really was! Okay?! Now shut the fuck up!
N: She KICKS the door as hard as she can and it SWINGS open, the frame SPLINTERING.
C: NAOMI
D: AHHH!!
N: Martigan busts into the house. Cole follows.
S: INT. NAOMI’S AIR BNB - CONTINUOUS
C: NAOMI
D: What the fuck is going on here?!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Please, calm down! We have to go! Right now!
C: NAOMI
D: What? No! Tell me what is happening!! How do you know each other?!?!?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Uh... we... uh...
C: NAOMI
D: You’re a fucking criminal too, aren’t you?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Um...
C: NAOMI
D: You’ve been lying to me?!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: ... I maybe lied about one thing!
C: COLE
D: Ooh. Don’t say that.
C: NAOMI
D: IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY BIG FUCKING THING!
C: COLE
D: We gotta get out of here! Please!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: We’ve wasted enough time! They’ll be here any second! Trust us!!
C: NAOMI
D: TRUST YOU?!! Why the FUCK would I do that?!!
N: Naomi starts to walk away from Martigan and Cole, when an SUV SMASHES THROUGH THE FRONT WALL OF THE HOUSE!!!! Martigan and Cole are KNOCKED to the ground! CLOSE ON MARTIGAN. On the ground. Bloody. A CEILING LAMP falls on her head, CRASHING. She SHOVES it off and GETS up just in time to see Naomi being DRAGGED into the SUV by some THUGS. They SLAM the car in REVERSE and SPEED AWAY, leaving a GAPING hole in the house. Martigan RUNS out the hole in the wall, followed by Cole. They watch in dread as Naomi is driven away.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: What the fuck. Oh no. Oh no.
N: Martigan looks back to her Mercedes and quickly moves towards it. Cole follows her.
C: COLE
D: Now they fucking have her, because of you.
N: Martigan gets to her car and starts pulling the DEAD THUGS out of the back.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: No, they fucking have her because
C: of YOU!
D: Don’t give me shit about lying to Naomi about being a criminal when you’re also lying to her about being a criminal, while you’re trying to win her back after getting divorced for lying to her about being a CRIMINAL!
E: beat
N: Cole stares daggers at Martigan.
C: COLE
D: Don’t judge me. If she really knew you, she’d hate you as much as she hates me.
N: Angry, Martigan gets in the car and slams the door shut. Then... a phone rings. Cole looks in his pocket. It’s Martigan’s phone. We see the call is from THE BOSS. Martigan GRABS it and answers.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yeah.
E: into phone
C: THE BOSS
D: Hooooolllllyyyyy shit. Look who it is. I got your friend. Which means I got you too. Come over to my place, alone, unarmed, and we’ll, you know, like, hash this out. Okay?
E: O.S. on speaker phone
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: ... okay.
C: THE BOSS
D: See you soon.
E: O.S. on speaker phone
N: Martigan hangs up and thinks. Cole FREAKS out.
C: COLE
D: What did you do? What-
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Look, we can keep arguing, or we can work together to save Naomi. What do you say?
C: COLE
D: How do we do that? We don’t even have a gun.
C: FAY
D: We got this car.
C: COLE
D: So?
N: Faye opens the trunk.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: It’s full of explosives.
N: We in fact see that it is FULL of explosives. There’s a detonator with a RED LIGHT attached to it.
C: COLE
D: Holy FUCK! Why?!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I was gonna lure The Boss to The Galleria and blow him up.
C: COLE
D: I could have exploded!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I’m honestly shocked you didn’t. I didn’t wire them that well.
N: Martigan locks eyes with Cole.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I can trust you? You’re not gonna fuck me in the ass again?
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: I’ve learned my lesson when it comes to fucking you over. It doesn’t work out. Can I trust you, Mad Martigan? Most ruthless and dangerous motherfucker in the city?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: You don’t have a choice, do you?
C: COLE
D: So, what’s the plan?
E: beat
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Kill The Boss.
T: CUT TO BLACK
N: TITLE UP: 7:00 PM We FADE INTO the familiar establishing shot of The Wilshire and The Galleria facing each other, the sun setting over downtown Los Angeles. But this time... the focus shifts DEEP into the background towards the Hollywood Hills. We PUSH IN on the HOLLYWOOD SIGN, and keep PUSHING until we land on The Boss’s magnificent mansion, standing precariously on a cliff overlooking the Hollywood sign, now with a series of stilts and support beams added to help keep it upright.
S: INT. THE BOSS’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: We TRACK across the living room, which is a mess. Pizza boxes, empty liquor bottles, and evidence of some harder drugs are strewn about. WE HEAR the strumming of a guitar, plucking a sad version of a familiar tune. We PAN and see a DARK FIGURE, sitting in the corner, guitar in hand. It’s like KURTZ in Apocalypse Now, a hulking presence shrouded in darkness. He continues playing the melancholy tune as we slowly PUSH IN ON HIM. Then, we hear him slowly start to sing sweetly, sadly, and beautifully.
C: THE BOSS
D: Yo listen up here’s a story/ about a little guy that lives in a blue world/ and all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue like him. Inside and outside/ Blue his house with a blue little window/ And a blue Corvette And everything is blue for him/ And himself and everybody around 'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen.
E: singing
N: The FIGURE STANDS AND STEPS INTO THE LIGHT. We see THE BOSS, who, in contrast to the last time we saw him, could not seem more devastated. He’s in his underwear, unshaven, messy hair, guitar slung around his shoulder. He continues singing...
C: THE BOSS
D: I'm blue... Da ba dee da ba daa Da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa Da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa...
E: CONT'D
N: He walks around his house as he plays. He looks down and sees something that makes him sadder still: a picture of him, Martigan, Harriet, Hawk, TikTok, and Vince, covered in blood and dirt after a successful mission, posing with big smiles on their faces and huge guns in their hands. He focus on Martigan’s arm around his shoulder. Both of them smiling. He sighs. Then starts to WAIL.
C: THE BOSS
D: I have a blue house with a blue window! Blue is the color of all that I wear! Blue are the streets and all the trees are too...
E: CONT'D
N: He looks at a FRAMED SELFIE STICK PIC of him and Martigan. He looks REALLY HAPPY, and she looks KIND OF HAPPY. The Boss takes a deep breath. This next line is hard to sing...
C: THE BOSS
D: I had a girlfriend and she was so blue...
E: CONT'D
N: He suddenly KICKS over the table as he sings more ANGRILY.
C: THE BOSS
D: Blue are the people here that walk around!!!
E: CONT'D
N: He KICKS in a TV SET.
C: THE BOSS
D: Blue like my Corvette, it's in and outside!!!
E: CONT'D
N: He KICKS a side table, sending it FLYING across the room.
C: THE BOSS
D: Blue are the words I say and what I think!
E: CONT'D
N: HE SMASHES HIS GUITAR. Stands alone, catching his breath. He looks up and sees a SHATTERED MIRROR in front of him. It’s incredibly heavy handed symbolism. He says with both sadness and rage...
C: THE BOSS
D: Blue are the feelings that live inside me.
E: CONT'D
N: The Boss stands alone in the room, a broken man.
C: THE BOSS
D: I’m BLUE BA DA DE-
E: CONT'D deep breathe, starting again
N: The front door opens and an UPPER LEVEL HENCHMAN enters to see The Boss singing.
C: UPPER LEVEL HENCHMEN
D: Boss, we-
C: THE BOSS
D: -BA DA... what the fuck?!?
C: UPPER LEVEL HENCHMEN
D: Sorry Boss! Uh...
N: The Henchman sees The Boss in his underwear with the guitar and can’t help but let out a tiny CHUCKLE.
C: THE BOSS
D: Is my pain funny to you?!
N: Harriet and TikTok now enter. BLAM! BLAM! The Boss SHOOTS the upper level henchmen in the head and he drops dead. His blood splatters all over TikTok’s crisp white suit and directly in Harriet’s face, leaving them both in utter shock.
C: THE BOSS
D: No so fucking funny now, you dead motherfucker! Cause you don’t exist anymore! What? Spit it out. I’m in the middle of something.
E: CONT'D to the henchmen’s dead body to TikTok and Harriet
C: TIKTOK
D: We found her.
E: trying to hide his fear
N: The Boss’s jaw drops.
C: THE BOSS
D: You found her?
E: hopeful
N: He calms himself, trying to play it cool, but failing.
C: THE BOSS
D: Where?
E: CONT'D
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: That new safe house. The apartment downtown. There’s a lookout across the street. He texted. Apparently she’s there.
C: THE BOSS
D: Oh my god. Okay. Okay.
N: He eyes up TikTok and Harriet.
C: THE BOSS
D: TikTok!
E: CONT'D points a TikTok
N: Harriet stifles a laugh.
C: THE BOSS
D: You’re my new main henchman.
E: CONT'D
C: TIKTOK
D: Nice! Yes! Fuck! Thank you!
N: Harriet tries to hide her disappointment and anger.
C: TIKTOK
D: Alright, great. What do you want me to do, Boss?
E: CONT'D
C: THE BOSS
D: Take a team...of, like, fifteen guys. If she’s actually there you call me right away. And keep her there. Don’t try to move her. I’ll come there.
C: TIKTOK
D: Alright, boss. You can count on me.
N: TikTok and Harriet leave. WE SEE QUICK CUTS of THE BOSS getting ready.
S: INT. THE BOSS’S APARTMENT - SHOWER
N: He SHOWERS as quickly as he can.
S: INT. THE BOSS’S APARTMENT - CLOSET
N: He tries on TEN OUTFITS, not happy with any of them.
C: THE BOSS
D: Fuck! Why do all my clothes SUCK?!
S: INT. THE BOSS’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM
N: He styles his hair, frustrated because he can’t decide which way to put his part. His PHONE RINGS. HE ANSWERS.
C: THE BOSS
D: Yeah?
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT. THE GALLERIA - MAD MARTIGAN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: In a scene we’ve already seen, TikTok is on the phone, face to face with Martigan, who sits on her chair, seemingly defeated.
C: TIKTOK
D: Hey Boss. We got Mad Martigan. 20th floor.
C: THE BOSS
D: Really? Uh... just. Keep her there.
N: The Boss is somewhat overwhelmed and sits down on the toilet.
C: TIKTOK
D: Yes sir. We’ll be here waiting.
C: THE BOSS
D: Actually, put me on speaker phone!
C: TIKTOK
D: Okay.
N: The Boss puts on a “serious voice”.
C: THE BOSS
D: Hey Madeline... I found you. Now... you just sit tight. I’ll be there in forty-five minutes. And then... we can talk. I’m pretty... bent out of shape right now. But... we’ll talk. Alright, guys. Keep her right there. If you have to shoot her for some reason, I understand. But, ideally, I call dibs on that.
E: beat louder
N: The BOSS HANGS up.
C: THE BOSS
D: “Dibs”?! Jesus, you idiot! What are you, twelve? Fuck! So stupid.
E: CONT'D to himself
S: INT. THE BOSS’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: The Boss emerges from his room dressed like he’s going on a date. He’s wearing a chic hat and a stylish fanny pack.
C: THE BOSS
D: All right, let’s go. I don’t wanna be late. Let’s go!
N: The Boss walks off with purpose and the henchman follows.
S: INT. BOSS’S CAR - SOON AFTER
N: The Boss is driven through the streets of LA by his henchmen. He lost in thought and looks intense. Then, his phone rings. He answers and we see TikTok and his thugs (from pg. 81 in the parking structure).
C: THE BOSS
D: Hello?
C: TIKTOK
D: Boss!! Harriet fucked up the whole plan and now she’s dead and Martigan got away-
E: on the phone
C: THE BOSS
D: She did?! You fucking-
C: TIKTOK
D: BUT, I found where stashed the friend!!!
C: THE BOSS
D: Really?!?!? Where??? Wait stop! Everything’s changing!
E: to driver
N: The car stops.
C: TIKTOK
D: 2201 Los Feliz!
C: THE BOSS
D: How long till we can get a truck load of guys to Los Feliz?
E: to his driver
C: DRIVER
D: Ten minutes.
C: THE BOSS
D: Alright. We’ll grab her in ten minutes.
C: TIKTOK
D: Ten minutes?! Perf-
N: The Boss hangs up and pumps his fists in excitment.
C: THE BOSS
D: Crazy! Change of plans. 180! Head back to the house!
S: EXT. THE BOSS’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: The Boss pulls up outside his house. A MOMENT later, his phone rings.
C: THE BOSS
D: You got her?! Fuck yeah boyeeeeeee!!!
E: into phone
N: He hangs up and makes a call.
C: THE BOSS
D: Hooooolllllyyyyy shit. Look who it is. I got your friend. And now I got you too.
E: CONT'D into phone MORE
C: THE BOSS
D: Come over to my place, alone, unarmed, and we’re gonna, you know, like, hash this out. Okay?
E: CONT'D
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: ... okay.
E: O.S. through phone
C: THE BOSS
D: See you soon.
N: The Boss walks in to his house. There’s 6 THUGS milling around.
C: THE BOSS
D: Alright!!! We have some guests coming! Clean this place up, boys! Make Hizau Uzo proud!!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. THE BOSS’S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
N: Thugs are manically cleaning the house as The Boss stares himself down in the mirror, in front of all the thugs.
C: THE BOSS
D: Hey Martigan, cool to see you. Whacky ass night, huh? Clearly the result of a lot of... passionate feelings. I feel like we both always knew something like this was bound to happen. I-
E: practicing
N: He notices a thug watching and stops. The Thug immediately goes back to cleaning.
C: THE BOSS
D: So, Martigan. Marty. Mad Marty Mar Mar. Here we find ourselves. I guess it was always-
E: CONT'D practicing
N: A car pulls to a stop outside and a moment later THUGS enter with Naomi in tow. She’s BOUND and GAGGED.
C: THUG
D: Here she is.
C: THE BOSS
D: Snap, Crackle, and POP. I win. Alright, now let’s see who all the fuss is about.
N: The Boss looks at Naomi’s terrified and gagged face.
C: THE BOSS
D: What the fuck? Are you joking me? She’s just some basic bitch! I thought she was going to be something special. What a fucking let down! How the fuck did you win over Martigan? I thought you’d have pink hair and a nose ring. Not split ends and New Balances. Well, FYI, you chose, like, the worst possible person to become friends with and now, unless you’ve got a magic fucking wand hidden up your bootyhole, you’re dunzo. You’re gonna either watch her die, then die, OR die as she watches, and THEN I’ll kill her. I honestly haven’t decided yet.
E: CONT'D beat
N: DING DONG! The doorbell rings. The Boss whips around to one of his thugs.
C: THE BOSS
D: Is that her?!?! How do I look?
E: CONT'D
C: THUG
D: Uh... no... it’s-
N: Cole BURSTS in to the room, sweaty, frantic, bloody.
C: COLE
D: I’m the lookout!! Boss! It’s me! The lookout! Col-
C: THE BOSS
D: Cole Markowitz?! You’re still alive? Holy shit! Good on ya, man! I heard it was a cluster fuck over there.
C: COLE
D: It was! Everything went to shit! Tiktok’s dead, everyone’s dead.
C: THE BOSS
D: Vertigo Vince?
C: COLE
D: Yep.
C: THE BOSS
D: Cyrus the Virus?
C: COLE
D: Dead.
C: THE BOSS
D: Harriet the Spy?
C: COLE
D: Gone.
C: THE BOSS
D: The Legion of Doom?
C: COLE
D: Who?
C: THE BOSS
D: Hawk and Animal!
C: COLE
D: Uh... yes. Unfortunately she caused them to perish as well. I’m the only one who made it.
C: THE BOSS
D: FUUUUUUUCK!
N: The Boss motions to Naomi, tied up in the chair.
C: THE BOSS
D: Sorry, how rude of me. This whack- ass chicken-head is Naomi. Don’t ask me why someone this lame is wrapped up in all this, but don’t worry, she’ll be dead soon. Thank god. I mean, oy. Just look at her.
E: CONT'D
N: Naomi YELLS through her gag but it’s unintelligible.
C: THE BOSS
D: So, Cole, I bet you’re wondering what this is all about.
E: CONT'D
C: COLE
D: Not really. You know me. Just keep my head down, don’t ask questions, cash the check. Honestly sometimes I think I’m better off not knowing the specifics of-
N: The Boss leans into Cole’s ears and talks in a hushed voice so his henchmen can’t hear.
C: THE BOSS
D: I’m in love with Mad Martigan... and she doesn’t love me back.
E: sad
C: COLE
D: Oh...
C: THE BOSS
D: So, yeah. If that’s not bad enough, she has the nerve to leave! She GHOSTED ME! It’s a big ass bummer. I mean, we weren’t TECHNICALLY dating, but she knew how I felt. I made it super clear, like all the time, so the ghosting was clearly a total rejection of my feelings. It was a ghost-reject. The WORST kind of reject! I mean, I shouldn’t be surprised. She’s insane. It’s why they call her “Mad Mardigan.” But... still. I love her. It’s my curse. Fuck me, right? I mean, what does that say about me?! YEESH! Therapy alert!
E: melancholy
N: The Boss LAUGHS. Cole PRETENDS TO LAUGH as he looks at his watch. He GLANCES over to Naomi, who’s watching, angry and confused. He gives her a LOOK to play along as he keeps pretending to laugh. WE BOOM DOWN THROUGH THE FLOOR of the house. WE BOOM PAST the CRUMBLING, OVERHANGING FOUNDATION, being propped up by a shoddily rigged collection of scaffolding and wedged in support beams. We KEEP BOOMING DOWN and REVEAL Martigan, standing on the hill UNDER the Boss’s overhanging house, the Hollywood sign in the distance.
S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - CONTINUOUS
N: We BOOM DOWN the “Y” of the Hollywood sign and see Martigan’s RED MERCEDES parked at the base.
S: EXT. UNDER THE BOSS’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Martigan looks at her watch. She takes out her RABBIT’S FOOT KEYCHAIN and HITS A BUTTON.
S: INT. THE BOSS'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: They’re still laughing.
C: THE BOSS
D: I mean, it wasn’t THAT funny, but it feels good to laugh in tense times like-
N: BOOOOOOM!!! In the distance - THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN EXPLODES!!!
C: THE BOSS
D: Holy fuck! OH FUCK! Holy fucking fuck! Guys! LOOK!!!
E: CONT'D
N: The Boss and the thugs all rush to the window and look towards the burning hillside, flaming chunks of giant letters drifting downward.
C: THE BOSS
D: Did you guys see tha-
E: CONT'D
N: The Boss looks back to Naomi and Cole and sees they’re BOTH GONE.
C: THE BOSS
D: What the fu-
E: CONT'D
N: RUMBLE!!! The entire building starts to shake.
S: INT. THE BOSS’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole leads Naomi down the hall as the building rubmles.
C: COLE
D: Run as fast as you can and don’t stop!
N: The entire structure shakes and quivers again.
C: NAOMI
D: What is happening?
E: muffled
C: COLE
D: We have less than a minute to get out of here or we’re fucked!
S: EXT. UNDER THE BOSSES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: We see Martigan has been smashing the SCAFFOLDING and SUPPORT BEAMS that hold the house up with a SLEDGE HAMMER. She takes another BIG SWING, DESTROYING more beams.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: RRRARRR!!!
N: She eyes a LARGER BEAM and SLAMS the sledge hammer into it.
C: MAR MARTIGAN
D: RRRRAAAAARRRR!!!!!!!!
S: INT. THE BOSS’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole and Naomi run as the house starts to collapse.
C: THUG
D: They went that way!
E: O.S
N: Cole looks back and see’s the thugs approaching. Cole spots a door at the far end of the hall. He looks back at the thugs who are gaining on them. Cole realizes the thugs are going to get to them before they reach the door.
C: COLE
D: Quick! There! Go out that door and don’t stop until you’re out!
N: Naomi RUNS towards the door as, unbeknownst to her, Cole turns AROUND and RUNS DIRECTLY AT THE THUGS!!! The surprised thugs raise their guns as Cole TACKLES THEM! They all fall to the ground as the building SHAKES again, and this time, the shaking doesn’t stop. RUMBLE! RUMBLE! RUMBLE! Naomi reaches the door and opens it as the shaking intensifies, the ground starting to crack and break. She runs out of the house.
S: EXT. THE BOSS’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Naomi looks back into the house to see Cole GRAPPLING with the two thugs as the ENTIRE HOUSE BREAKS FREE from the driveway and starts SLIDING DOWN THE HILL!!!
C: NAOMI
D: Holy shit!!!
S: INT. THE BOSS’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Cole and the thugs tumble down the hallway as the house slides down the hill on a 45% angle. They SMASH through double doors into-
S: INT. THE BOSS'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: - The main room, where The Boss is already pressed up against the large glass windows. As the building pushes it’s way down the hillside the furniture and art CHAOTICALLY FLIES around the room while trees and rocks SMASH through the massive GLASS WINDOWS.
S: EXT. THE HILLSIDE - CONTINUOUS
N: Martigan watches in awe as the house goes by. She looks up to the driveway and sees Naomi is there and safe. But where’s Cole? She look to the house BASHING it’s way down the hill, then sees Cole through a window, INSIDE the moving house!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Oh fuck.
N: She SPRINTS towards the house as it PLOWS through a few more trees and ultimately come to a stop TEETERING on the EDGE of a CLIFF!
S: INT. THE BOSS’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Every piece of art and furniture and appliance imaginable has been up-ended, tossed around, and lodged into different parts of the room. A fire is growing in the kitchen. One of the thugs can be seen CRUSHED by the branches of a huge TREE. Cole is unconscious on the ground. He starts to come to, only to find himself SLIDING towards the edge.
C: COLE
D: Oh no...
N: He SCRAMBLES to GRAB anything he can and manages to grab onto a KAWS SCULPTURE... but the arm RIPS off! He starts to move faster, desperately clawing at the floor, but to no avail. He FALLS OVER THE EDGE... when a hand suddenly reaches out and GRABS him! It’s Martigan!!!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Gotcha motherfucker!
C: COLE
D: Oh thank god!!!
N: Martigan PULLS Cole to safety. They look at each other, relieved. But the moment is short lived when the entire building starts to rise up on an angle, teetering over the edge. Cole and Martigan start to run as the houses becomes increasingly steep; it’s as though they were running up an incredibly steep hill. And all while myriad different objects start to fall towards them. At the other end of the room, Cole sees the now-broken WINDOW in the FLOOR.
C: COLE
D: THERE! THERE!
E: CONT'D
N: They claw their way up the almost vertical room as objects tumble towards them. The building goes so vertical that Martigan starts to slide again. Cole reaches up to the busted window frame and holds on with one hand as his other hand clutches onto Martigan’s. They both manage to climb up and JUMP through the hole as the house teeters up one last time, moments away from crashing over the edge and down the cliff.
S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - CONTINUOUS
N: Martigan and Cole LAND on the ground. They look up at the house as it goes vertical, and just when it’s about to fall over the edge, it CRACKS in two at the midpoint, sending the part of the house they just jumped out of FALLING BACK DOWN TOWARDS THEM!
C: COLE
D: AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
N: There’s no way they can outrun it. Martigan sizes up the hole, grabs Cole, and moves them two steps to the right. CRAAAASSSSHHHH!!!! The house SLAMS down ONTO THEM.
S: INT. THE BOSS’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Martigan and Cole are shocked to find themselves ALIVE, and in The Boss’s house! The building slammed down around them, but they were perfectly aligned with the window in floor. They look at each other in awe, then open the door and step out.
S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - CONTINUOUS
N: Martigan and Cole exit the decimated remnants of the Boss’s house.
C: NAOMI
D: Madeline! Cole!
E: O.S.
N: They look up to see Naomi running down the hill towards them.
C: NAOMI
D: Oh my god! You’re alive!
E: CONT'D
N: In the background, unbeknownst to everyone, we see The Boss SLOWLY pulling himself up over the edge of the cliff holding a GUN!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Yeah... I think we are.
N: The Boss is about to shoot them, but is so out of breath he has to take a knee to gather himself.
C: NAOMI
D: Are you hurt?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I don’t think so? Cole? You okay?
C: COLE
D: Yeah... I think so...
N: The Boss take a deep breathe, exhales, and stands up.
C: COLE
D: You? You’re okay?
E: CONT'D to Naomi
C: NAOMI
D: Yeah.
N: The Boss walks towards them and raises his gun.
C: THE BOSS
D: NOT FOR FUCKING LONG!
N: They all turn and finally see him.
C: THE BOSS
D: You can’t kill what you can’t understand, dickwads. And I’m a well-dressed enimga wrapped in a bomb ass Balenciaga coat, and I burn brightest right before I-
E: CONT'D
N: BLAM! The Boss gets SHOT in the stomach-
C: THE BOSS
D: Ouchy! My tummy! Whoa! Whoa! Okay, wait...
E: CONT'D slips on a rock
N: The Boss FALLS back off the cliff.
C: THE BOSS
D: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-
E: CONT'D
N: Martigan and Cole look to see a bruised and battered Harriet, covered in bits of pink insulation foam, standing behind Naomi, a smoking gun in hand. She AIMS at Naomi.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Harriet. Look if you want to-
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Save it. You’ve already said what you need to say to me and...
N: She lowers her gun.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: ... that shit really hit home. You’re right. I can change. I don’t have to be the same thing all my life. I can want more. And that’s why I’m done being some low level thug.
E: CONT'D
N: Martigan smiles at this.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Instead, I’m taking over. There’s a Boss-shaped hole in the city, and I’ll be fucked if I’m not filling it. So... thank you. I’m in charge now. Because of you.
E: CONT'D beat
N: Martigan nods. Good enough. She’ll take it. Harriet points her gun at Cole and Naomi.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: So what’s their deal? We killing them, or-
E: CONT'D
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: We’re NOT killing them.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Sure. Whatevs. Well, you ever wanna buy some heroin or a bazooka or have someone kidnapped or assasinated or something, gimme a ring. Peace out, Mad Martigan.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Call me Madeline.
C: HARRIET THE SPY
D: Nah. That’s fucking lame. You’re Mad Martigan, whether you like it or not.
N: Harriet RUNS off into the night. Martigan, Cole, and Naomi all look at each other. The sounds of approaching sirens can be heard. Police and news helicopters can be seen approaching.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Let’s get the fuck out of here.
C: COLE
D: If we get down to that road I can boost a car.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Great. I have a safe house in Encino we can hide out in until the heat blows over.
N: Martigan and Cole start to move, when they realize Naomi hasn’t.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Naomi, we gotta go, like, now. The cops will be hear any minute.
E: CONT'D
C: NAOMI
D: Yeah. And I’m going to wait here for them.
C: COLE
D: What? What would you even tell them?
N: Naomi stares daggers at them, dumbfounded and angry.
C: NAOMI
D: The fucking TRUTH.
N: Martigan and Cole are confused.
C: NAOMI
D: What if they find out I was involved somehow, and that I didn’t report it? I could go to jail! I’m not going to jail for this shit!
E: CONT'D
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Okay, well then I guess you just leave out our names, and we’ll lay low and reach out to you in a week or-
C: NAOMI
D: No! You don’t seem to get it. I’m telling the police absolutely everything; that my EX husband and my EX best friend both lied to me, somehow got me kidnapped and made a whole house slide down a hill after blowing up the fucking Hollywood sign!
C: COLE
D: I mean... we could get in a LOT of trouble for that-
C: NAOMI
D: Good!
N: Martigan and Cole are flabbergasted.
C: NAOMI
D: Look at you two... You both say you want someone to be close with, someone who “gets who you are” and “knows you”? Congratulations! You found ‘em! You’re exactly the fucking same.
E: CONT'D
N: Naomi takes off her BFF bracelet and THROWS it at Cole. He catches it.
C: NAOMI
D: You deserve each other. And I never want to see either of you again.
E: CONT'D
N: Martigan and Cole look at each other, stunned, then back to Naomi, who just stares them down until they awkwardly turn and walk away. Martigan and Cole head down the hillside. We stay on their shocked faces as they hurry away, trying to process what just happened.
S: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: SMASH! The window to a car is broken. Cole reaches in and unlocks the door, and he and Martigan get in. They sit for a moment as Cole fiddles with some WIRES under the steering wheel.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I can’t believe she said that.
C: COLE
D: Well, she did have one good point.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: What’s that?
N: Cole holds up his wrist. He’s wearing Naomi’s bracelet.
C: COLE
D: We deserve each other. That’s why we’re BFF’S now.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: How fucking dare you.
C: COLE
D: It’s the law! I can’t help it! We’re bound by the magic of the bracelet!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: You’re not pissed?! She just kicked you out of her life, too!
C: COLE
D: Yeah... but honestly, I want her to be happy, and she IS better off without me. And you. She’s too good for us.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: I want to change.
E: beat
C: COLE
D: Me too. But I very, very clearly haven’t as much as I need to.
N: Martigan thinks on this.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Me either I guess.
C: COLE
D: And that’s why we deserve each other.
N: Martigan has a thought that grosses her out.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: If you think I’m EVER going to fuck you-
C: COLE
D: No! I never assumed this would go there.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Good!
C: COLE
D: Number one rule of BFFs is you don’t fuck your BFF.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Stop calling me that!
C: COLE
D: I’m not calling you that! The bracelet is calling you that!
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Just hurry up! I thought you were good at this.
N: VROOOOM! The engine revs.
C: COLE I am.
D: Where too?
E: beat
N: BEHIND THEM - a COP CAR fishtails on to the street, and SCREECHES to a stop. It SHINES it’s spotlight on their car!
C: COP
D: FREEZE! COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!
E: over speaker
N: Ahead of them two more cop cars are SCREECH around the corner. The cop cars stop in front of them. Their BOXED IN! Martigan and Cole desperately search for a way out. But there isn’t one.
C: COP
D: SURRENDER OR WE WILL OPEN FIRE!
E: CONT'D over speaker
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Fuck.
C: COLE
D: Yeah. Fuck.
N: Cole and Martigan sit, thinking. They both PEER over the side of the HILL beside them. It’s STEEP and LONG cliffside, but... maybe they won’t die?
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: What do you think?
C: COLE
D: I think I’d rather not go to jail for the rest of my life for blowing up the Hollywood sign.
C: MAD MARTIGAN
D: Ditto.
