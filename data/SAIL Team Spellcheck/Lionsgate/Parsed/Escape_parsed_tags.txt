0: M: NOTE TO THE READER:
0: 
N: All the action will be played in as WIDE SHOTS as possible
N: with as FEW CUTS as possible. It will feel like a Jackie
N: Chan/Buster Keaton-style stunt extravaganza. Editing will
N: never be used to hide the faces of the performers, bridge
N: gaps in the choreography, or reconcile inconsistent blocking.
N: It will feel like it is all being played out in real life by
N: real performers interacting with real objects in real spaces.
0: 
N: ALSO:
0: 
N: Please forgive the extremely long description of two
N: buildings you’re about to read, but we’re going to spend a
N: lot of time with them, so we promise it’s worthwhile.

S: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DUSK
0: 
N: We see the sun setting, sinking behind an EMPTY and ABANDONED
N: industrial area on the outskirts of Downtown LA. TWO TOWERING
N: BUILDINGS facing one another, a narrow street running between
N: them, the HOLLYWOOD SIGN in the deep background.
0: 
N: TITLE UP: 7:00PM
0: 
N: To the left is a concrete goliath from the 50’s. It’s 25
N: stories of once stunning brutalist modern architecture, now
N: aged. A un-illuminated RED NEON SIGN that reads THE WILSHIRE
N: crawls down the side of the building.
0: 
N: There’s a sign in front of The Wilshire that features a
N: rendering of TWO NEW ULTRA CONTEMPORARY apartment buildings
N: with the words “COMING SOON!”.
0: 
N: DIRECTLY ACROSS the street stands one of the BRAND NEW ULTRA
N: CONTEMPORARY apartment buildings from the rendering. Above
N: the lobby a sign reads THE GALLERIA.
0: 
N: A LARGE BANNER hangs from The Wilshire to The Galleria: “NOW
N: LEASING”.
0: 
N: The Galleria is twice as tall as The Wilshire, with sleek
N: glass, steel, concrete, POPS of brightly colored accents and
N: LED screens throughout. It’s part apartment building, part
N: high end mall, filled with luxury stores and fancy
N: restaurants.
0: 
N: The building is unoccupied, though many rooms are already
N: furnished. About 20% of it is still being built. A huge
N: CONSTRUCTION YARD surrounds the back of the building. Half
N: way up a crane is mounted to the side of the building.
0: 
N: Workers leave both buildings for the night.
0: 0:                                                             2.
0: 
0: 
N: THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS towards The Wilshire and starts moving
N: UP and alongside it’s exterior.
0: 
N: As we rise we catch glimpses of the building’s interior. The
N: apartments are OLD, DECREPIT, and EMPTY. Some of them are
N: already stripped down, as the building is being prepped for
N: demolition. We rise to the 20th floor, push towards the
N: building, and enter...
0: 
0: 
S: INT. THE WILSHIRE - 20TH FLOOR - COLE’S APARTMENT -
N: CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: We see an sparse and rundown apartment filled with boxes. We
N: TRACK BACK through it and find COLE, a clean and put together
N: guy in his late-thirties, standing in front of a brand new
N: record player. He drops the needle onto a spinning vinyl and
N: turns up the volume:
0: 
N: MUSIC UP: WHOLE LOTTA LOVE by LED ZEPPELIN
0: 
N: - We see Cole opening a series of delivery boxes. Cleaning
N: products, kitchen supplies, little Ikea rugs, etc. He’s
N: clearly just moving into this place.
0: 
N: - He starts CLEANING RIGOROUSLY, on his hands and knees,
N: scrubbing the floor as best he can. He has a DETERMINED look
N: on his face.
0: 
N: - He VACUUMS every surface, including the curtains.
0: 
N: - As he WIPES down the counters over and over, trying to make
N: them spotless, we see some JOB APPLICATIONS with his name:
N: COLEMAN MARKOWITZ. There’s also some PAROLE paperwork in the
N: stack. He puts the papers in a drawer, clearing the clutter.
0: 
N: - He sees a RAT with black body and white head run by, and
N: grabs a PAN! He CHASES it into the corner and RAISES the pan,
N: about to smash it; but then the right looks right at him.
0: 
N: Beat.
0: 
C:                     COLE
D:           Fuck it. Go little rat. Go.
0: 
N: The rat RUNS off and squirms through a crack in the wall.
N: Cole keeps cleaning.
0: 
N: - He PAINSTAKINGLY assembles a SHELF from Ikea.
0: 
N: - Cole uses a LASER LEVEL to hang the SHELF on the wall. He
N: puts some COOKBOOKS, a MUG, and some other stuff on it.
0: 0:                                                             3.
0: 
0: 
N: - He lays a CUTTING BOARD on the counter and then places a
N: puts a big knife on it, almost staging the space to look
N: nice.
0: 
N: - Exhausted, he assess the room. All things considered, it
N: looks pretty good.
0: 
C:                           COLE (CONT'D)
D:              Not bad...
0: 
N: He SNAPS a picture on his phone, pleased with his hard work.
N: Then, he nervously goes through his contacts and pulls up
N: WIFEY. He is about to dial, hesitates for a moment, then
N: presses the button. It goes STRAIGHT TO THE VOICEMAIL.
0: 
N: Cole gets a TEXT:
0: 
N: WIFEY: I’d rather text than talk to you on the phone.
0: 
N: This upsets Cole, but he pushes forward and TEXTS her:
0: 
N: COLE: Hey. I just haven’t heard from you in a couple days. I
N: was just checking in to see if you thought more about maybe
N: seeing me again? Giving me another chance? You could swing by
N: We could talk in person?
0: 
N: Cole anxiously awaits a response:
0: 
N: WIFEY: I’m not sure.
0: 
N: It’s not the answer Cole was hoping for, but he keeps on:
0: 
N: COLE: I’d love to see you. It’s been like six months. I know
N: things ended badly between us. I get why you didn’t see me
N: while I was locked up, but now that I’m out, I’d love to see
N: you again.
0: 
N: WIFEY: ...
0: 
N: He waits to see what she’s typing, but nothing appears.
0: 
N: COLE: I just want you to know I’m ready. I’ve got my life
N: back on track. I’ve got a new place. A new job. It’s a whole
N: new me. Check it out!
0: 
N: He sends the PICTURE of his apartment. He sees her response:
0: 
N: WIFEY: This new job isn’t anything like your old job?
0: 
N: Cole quickly types back:
0: 
N: COLE: Of course not! I’ve completely changed! I’m the
N: caretaker of this building as they prep it for demolition.
0: 0:                                                           4.
0: 
0: 
N: It’s a big responsibility. I make sure nobody’s here who’s
N: not supposed to be. It’s like, a legit job.
0: 
N: WIFEY: So you’re responsible now?
0: 
N: COLE: Super responsible! I got a fire extinguisher, like you
N: were always telling me we should have. First thing I got when
N: I moved in.
0: 
N: He TAKES A PIC of his FIRE EXTINGUISHER and sends it to her.
0: 
N: WIFEY: I bet you still can’t even keep your phone charged.
0: 
N: Cole looks. It’s at 4%. He doesn’t know how to respond.
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           Hmmm...
0: 
N: WIFEY: I don’t think I can trust you again. You lied to me
N: for five years.
0: 
N: COLE: I lied about one thing. Everything else about me was
N: real.
0: 
N: WIFEY: BEING A CAR THIEF AND LYING ABOUT IT IS A PRETTY BIG
N: THING!
0: 
N: Cole doesn’t know what to say. He thinks hard, then responds:
0: 
N: COLE: I know I lied to you, and I’ll always regret it, and
N: I’ve learned my lesson. You know me better than anyone in the
N: world. You get who I am. And you’ve helped make me a better
N: person. The type of person you deserve. Please. Can we just
N: talk on the phone?
0: 
N: ACROSS THE STREET, on the same floor as Cole (20th), we see a
N: light get FLIPPED on in an apartment. It gets Cole’s
N: attention, as it’s the only apartment that appears to be
N: occupied in the entire building.
0: 
N: He watches A WOMAN enter the pre-furnished apartment, rolling
N: in a large piece of LOUIS VUITTON LUGGAGE and a LOUIS VITTON
N: PURSE slung over her shoulder.
0: 
N: He takes out a PINK PIECE OF PAPER and texts the number on
N: it.
0: 
N: COLE: Yo Zac. There’s some lady in The Galleria FYI.
0: 
N: Then another text appears from Wifey.
0: 
N: WIFEY: I know you want to be ready, but I just don’t think
N: you are.
0: 0:                                                             5.
0: 
0: 
N: Cole hangs his head, devastated.
0: 
N: He debates typing more, but decides against it. He puts the
N: cell back in his pocket and let’s out a defeated sigh. He’s
N: so focused on his own sadness that he remains completely
N: unaware as BEHIND HIM and ACROSS THE STREET the woman’s
N: apartment door is KICKED OPEN and 20 HEAVILY ARMED THUGS RUSH
N: IN!!! The woman, sitting in a chair, seems caught off guard
N: and frozen in fear.
0: 
N: The MAIN THUG, dressed in an CRISP WHITE SUIT that already
N: has a splatter of blood on it, steps forward and brutally
N: PUNCHES HER in the HEAD!
0: 
N: Cole, still completely oblivious, grabs a beer and an
N: UNCOOKED STEAK from the fridge. He FLIPS on the stove, pours
N: some oil in a pan and tosses the steak on. He CHUGS his beer,
N: drowning his sorrows.
0: 
N: Behind him, the main thug starts interrogating the woman,
N: PUNCHING her AGAIN and AGAIN.
0: 
N: Cole sips his beer again, slowly and sadly, still utterly
N: oblivious. The thugs CONTINUES to beat the woman and then
N: VIOLENTLY ties her to a chair.
0: 
N: Cole starts to quietly WEEP to himself. He shakes his head,
N: then CHUGS the rest of his beer. He walks over to his freezer
N: where there’s a full bottle of Vodka. Cole takes a HUGE SWIG
N: as, behind him, we see the THUGS in the background yelling at
N: the woman as they point GUNS at her!
0: 
N: Cole pulls a JOINT out of his SHIRT POCKET and starts taking
N: BIG, ANGRY HITS as he tries to get fucked up enough to forget
N: his woes. He sucks down the joint in no time, then TOSSES the
N: roach across the room, landing it directly in the sink. He
N: takes ANOTHER SWIG of VODKA and puts the bottle back in the
N: freezer.
0: 
N: HE looks over to his STEAK, still sizzling in the pan. He
N: goes over, when he FINALLY sees what’s happening across the
N: street: over a dozen ARMED THUGS with guns AIMED at a
N: HELPLESS WOMAN tied to a chair!
0: 
C:                      COLE (CONT'D)
D:           Oh shit!
0: 
N: He throws his arms up in shock, TOSSING his beer can across
N: the room. He watches in horror as the main thug PUTS HIS GUN
N: AGAINST THE WOMAN’S HEAD!
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           No! No, no, no!
0: 0:                                                          6.
0: 
0: 
N: He SCRAMBLES for something to do, and sees the LASER LEVEL
N: beside him. He picks it up and SHOOTS IT ACROSS THE STREET in
N: an attempt to distract the killers; it’s RED LASER DOT
N: appears in the centre of the gun-weilding thugs chest.
0: 
N: The thug notices it and motions for everyone to find COVER.
N: They scatter, then trace the laser back to it’s source, which
N: leads all the thugs to look directly at COLE!
0: 
C:                      COLE (CONT'D)
D:           OH FUCK.
0: 
N: Cole DUCKS down. He thinks for a moment, then scrambles to
N: pull out his cell. He starts to unlock it, when the BATTERY
N: RUNS OUT and the phone SHUTS OFF.
0: 
N: Cole starts to panic. His eyes dart around the room. He sees
N: a CORD plugged into the wall and, staying close to the
N: ground, scampers towards it. He tries to plug his phone into
N: it, but it’s an iPad 11 Pro plug, not an iPhone 11 Pro plug.
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           FUCKING APPLE!!! HOW MANY DIFFERENT
D:           PLUGS DO YOU NEED?!
0: 
N: He crawls towards the window and cautiously PEEKS his head
N: up: he sees the thugs have all taken cover and the MAIN THUG
N: is motioning for TWO TACTICAL LOOKING THUGS to go TO COLE’S
N: APARTMENT!
0: 
N: Cole YANKS the curtains shut. He PANICS. He GETS UP and moves
N: away from the window, tearing open drawers. FINALLY, he finds
N: a drawer FILLED with different cords.
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           Oh goddamit! So many cords!
0: 
N: He find the right type of cord and desperately starts to
N: untangle it from the messy bundle. He frees it, then realizes
N: it’s JUST the cord, as in there’s no CUBE that actually let’s
N: you plug it into an outlet!
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           Fucking charging cube!
0: 
N: He cautiously goes back to the window and peeks out. There’s
N: now SEVEN thugs in the room with the woman. The others must
N: have scattered. He looks DOWN TO THE STREET and sees the TWO
N: TACTICAL THUGS leaving The Galleria... and coming across the
N: street to COLE’S BUILDING!
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           OH FUCK ME!
0: 0:                                                             7.
0: 
0: 
N: COLE FREAKS OUT, digging faster until he finally finds a cube
N: to plug the wire into.
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
E:               (fumbling with the cord)
D:           Come on... motherfucker...
0: 
N: He immediately plugs his phone into the nearest outlet. The
N: CHARGING icon comes on, and he realizes it’s going to take a
N: couple minutes for the phone to come back to life.
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           Oh what the fucking fuck.
0: 
N: Cole leaves the phone plugged in and RUNS over to his front
N: door. He opens the door looks down the hall, and sees the
N: ELEVATOR has left the lobby and is COME UP!
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           SHIT!
0: 
N: Cole DUCKS BACK into his apartment. He looks around for
N: somewhere to hide. There’s no good options. He runs BACK to
N: his front door to see if he can make it to the stairs.
0: 
N: He looks down the LONG HALL to the staircase, than BACK to
N: the elevator. It’s on the 14th FLOOR, 15th FLOOR, 16th
N: FLOOR!!!
0: 
N: Cole makes a mad DASH for the STAIRCASE, but when he’s about
N: a third of the way there, he hears the *BING* of the
N: elevator.
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           Dammit!
0: 
N: He’ll never make it to the stairs. He TURNS AROUND and RUNS
N: BACK to his apartment. The elevator doors start to open.
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           Hey! Yo! Look! I’m-
0: 
N: PHOOM! A GAS CANISTER is LAUNCHED from inside the elevator,
N: NAILING Cole in the stomach.
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           Ah!!
0: 
N: GAS SHOOTS EVERYWHERE as one of the tactical thugs named
N: ANIMAL bursts from the elevator and CHARGES towards Cole!
0: 
N: Cole, COUGHING AND GAGGING, jumps back into his apartment and
N: closes the door behind him.
0: 0:                                                          8.

S: INT. THE WILSHIRE - COLE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: Cole runs in, panicking as he despseratly GASPS for air. He
N: looks for somewhere to hide, when Animal KICKS open the the
N: door.
0: 
N: He RAISES his gun as he steps fowards to make the kill shot,
N: but SLIPS on the BEER that Cole spilled earlier. He SLAMS to
N: the ground and LOSES his gun, which SLIDES under the fridge.
0: 
N: Cole, still coughing, tries to RUN out the door but Animal
N: GRABS his LEG and THROWS HIM towards the kitchen.
0: 
C:                     COLE
E:               (through coughs)
D:           Please! I’m...look...I’m-
0: 
N: Animal approaches; he’s clearly not going to listen to
N: anything. Cole GRABS his new FIRE EXTINGUISHER and HITS
N: Animal in the face with it, KNOCKING OUT a few of his TEETH.
0: 
N: Animal is PISSED.
0: 
C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           I’m sorry! Listen-
0: 
N: Animal SWINGS at Cole, who raises up the fire extinguisher to
N: block the blow. Animal’s FIST collides with the top of the
N: fire extinguisher, causing it to SNAP off. Compressed gas
N: ROCKETS out of the extinguisher, sending it SOARING out of
N: Cole’s hands, ricochetting off a wall, and FLYING OUT THE
N: WINDOW!
0: 
N: Cole is shocked, but Animal doesn’t miss a beat. He GRABS a
N: KNIFE off of the kitchen counter and THRUSTS it at Cole. Cole
N: grabs a big bottle of OLIVE OIL and BLOCKS the knife. It
N: PUNCTURES the bottle and oil SPURTS into Animal’s seyes.
0: 
C:                     ANIMAL
D:           AHHH!!
0: 
N: Animal BLINDLY LUNGES with the knife again. Cole grabs a
N: little GARBAGE BIN and puts it over the knife in Animal’s
N: hand. Animal FLINGS the bin off his hand and WHIPS the KNIFE
N: at Cole, who HOLDS UP A CUTTING BOARD. It STICKS in the
N: board. A thankful Cole tosses them both aside and onto a
N: nearby counter.
0: 
N: Animal PUNCHES Cole, who stumbles back towards the fridge.
N: Cole SWINGS OPEN the FREEZER DOOR, trying to hit Animal in
N: the face with it, but Animal just GRABS IT, RIPS IT OFF ITS
N: HINGES, and WHACKS Cole over the head with it.

0: 
0: 
N: Cole stumbles back and turns to run, but Animal HURLS the
N: FREEZER DOOR like a giant frisbee, NAILING Cole in the back.
0: 
N: Cole falls, the door landing right beside him. Animal reaches
N: into the FREEZER and pulls out the BOTTLE OF VODKA. He HURLS
N: it at Cole, and it NAILS him in the head, but doesn’t break.
N: Animal looks and the fridge is FULL of vodka bottles. He
N: HURLS another one, but Cole grabs the FREEZER DOOR and uses
N: it as a shield. SMASH! The bottle shatters.
0: 
N: Animal grabs a another bottle, breaks it, and advances with
N: the jagged half-broken bottle. Cole spots a BOX OF BAKING
N: SODA in the FREEZER DOOR and HURLS IT at Animal, hitting him
N: in the face and temporarily BLINDING him.
0: 
N: A terrified Cole starts running in a big circle around his
N: apartment as Animal chases him.

D:           Stupid motherfucker!
0: 
N: Animal punches him again. Cole starts running again, and
N: Animal chasing. Cole spots the frying pan on the stove with
N: the steak in olive oil. He runs past it, flipping on the
N: element. He makes another lap of the apartment. Animal is hot
N: on his tail.
0: 
N: Animal and Cole face off on opposite sides of the KITCHEN
N: ISLAND. Cole inches one way, Animal follows. He inches the
N: other way, and Animal matches him. It’s a stand off. Cole is
N: incredibly OUT OF BREATH. Animal isn’t, which makes him
N: smile.
0: 
N: Cole quickly grabs a cup of water and HURLS it at the PAN. It
N: sends FLAMING OIL SPLASHING ALL OVER ANIMAL, ENGULFING him in
N: FLAMES!!!

C:                     COLE
D:           It’s okay! I got you!

C:                     COLE (CONT'D)
D:           I’m so sorry, dude. Feel better.
0: 
N: Cole RUNS towards the door of his apartment. He stops, looks
N: back and sees his PHONE, plugged in to the wall near Animal,
N: who is now lying motionless on the ground, seemingly passed
N: out from the pain. Cole goes over to Grab it when Animal
N: SPRINGS to his feet and GRABS Cole by the throat, RAGE IN HIS
N: EYES.

N: HE HOISTS HIM UP and SLAMS him against the wall, choking him.
N: Cole’s eyes start to roll back. He desperately looks for
N: something to help him. He grabs a MUG off the shelf above
N: him, and WHACKS Animal with it. It does nothing. He grabs a
N: COOKBOOK off the shelf and WHACKS Animal with it. It just
N: makes him madder. Cole’s going dark.
0: 
N: Then... he sees the CUTTING BOARD WITH THE KNIFE STICKING OUT
N: OF IT on the counter behind Animal. Cole lobs the COOKBOOK.
N: It CLIPS the edge of the CUTTING BOARD, which FLIPS it off

N: Hawk LOOKS towards the STAIRWELL, murder in his eyes, and

N: notices, across the room, an EXTENSION CORD peeking out from
N: around a corner.
0: 
N: He looks down to his phone and charger, and then starts
N: moving across the room towards the extension cord, when
N: *BING*. The elevator arrives. Cole JUMPS behind HALF A WALL
N: just as the doors open, revealing Hawk. He steps out,
N: furiously hunting for Cole.
0: 
N: Cole waits till Hawk storms off down another hall, then

0: 
N: BING! An ELEVATOR arrives in the landing area below them and
N: another thug, BALKI, emerges. He sees the TWO MEN STRUGGLING

N: wrapped around Hawk’s leg and pulled Cole over the edge with
N: him!

N: the elevator call button, causing the doors to OPEN AGAIN.
0: 
N: Balki runs up and TACKLES Cole to the ground. This causes the
N: cord to YANK Hawk UP towards the railing they’re hanging

N: BREAKS! Hawk FALLS over the edge and lands on Cole and Balki.
N: Hawk and Balki hit the ground HARD and are knocked
N: UNCONSCIOUS.
0: 
N: And then... the elevator doors start to close again. Cole,
N: woozy, GRABS a broken piece of the railing and THROWS it at

0: 
N: All three of them, tangled up in the cord together, start to

0: 
N: Cole grabs the SHOE he threw earlier and starts to REACH for
N: the button, when Hawk and Balki start to come to. Cole PICKS

N: We see a young woman RECORDING a SILLY DANCE for the app
N: TIKTOK in front of a water fountain. She is completely
N: oblivious as, in the background, we see our TikTok chasing
N: another THUG in a suit. He STABS the guy in the shoulder and
N: he falls in to the waterfountain! The woman KEEPS DANCING,
N: unaware, as TikTok comes in for the killing blow, but slips
N: and falls into the fountain!

N: The thug and TikTok thrash in the water as they fight over
N: the knife. TikTok finally manages to take the knife and STABS

D:           grown women, and you don’t even
D:           have to wear it, but ever since I
D:           was a kid, I wanted someone to have
D:           half of one of these with... and,

N: Martigan rounds a corner and the full scope of the club is
N: revealed. It’s one huge room, the floor is covered in white
N: tile, the walls are concrete and HUGE GLASS WINDOWS show The
N: Wilshire across the street. At the centre of the room is a
N: giant SHARK TANK filled with small reef-sharks. A school of
N: DOLPHIN SCULPTURES hangs from the ceiling by cables. The
N: floor plays the image of an ocean on a loop. The water
N: interacts when people step on it, as though they are walking
N: on water. And on the far side of the room is TikTok, Harriet,
N: and Cyrus searching for her bag.

0: 
N: Martigan tries to hold on, but the blood from Harriet
N: stabbing her has dripped down her arm and made her hand too
N: slippery. Harriet’s hand slides out. Martigan sadly watches
