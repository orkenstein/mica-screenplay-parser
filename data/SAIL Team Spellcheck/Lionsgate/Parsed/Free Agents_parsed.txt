T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: 1 EXT. LOS ANGELES - NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - 4:00AM
N: It’s too early for birds to start chirping, but not too early for this determined runner, WILL GRIER (26)-- He breathes hard with sweat pouring down his face. As he rounds the corner, a steep hill appears-- Sparking a fire in Will’s hungry eyes, he puts it in 5th gear, and SPRINTS all the way to the top... On top of the hill, he stops for a deep breath. He uses his shirt as a makeshift towel-- Revealing, a SCAR across his LI abdomen. We 360 around Will, and now notice how impressive his athletic physique is... O Over this image, our title FILLS THE SCREEN--
C: TITLE CARD: “FREE AGENTS”
D: N
N: SFX PRE-LAP: Alarm Clock, BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP... SLAP! SG
T: CUT TO:
S: 2 INT/EXT. CAR - DRIVING - WASHINGTON, D.C. - SAME
N: AT Vidal drives through traffic, stressed and late. Her mind races faster than the wiper blades zipping back and forth across her rain drenched window-- She makes a sharp turn, and loose papers slide off the passenger seat. E The speeding car resembles a messy locker, with empty coffee cups and papers littered about. As her eyes look in the rear- view, they catch an empty toddler car seat in the back...
S: 3 INT. GRIER HOME - LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
N: Will enters his modest home, and walks through the silent living room. Unpacked boxes and limited decoration show he hasn’t lived there long. 4V He grabs a remote and flips on the TV. An “ESPN-like” channel pops on: A REPORTER stands in front of the LA FOOTBALL FACILITY-- A chyron reads, “LAST DAY FOR FOOTBALL TEAMS TO MAKE CUTS AND FINALIZE THEIR 53-MAN ROSTERS.” Will gives it a long stare and shuts it off.
S: 5 INT. GRIER HOME - JAMES’ BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Will peaks his head into a bedroom cluttered with dinosaurs and monster trucks. He smiles when his eyes find his son, JAMES (6, socially withdrawn boy with special needs), fast asleep. He closes the door, and walks down to his bedroom.
S: 6 INT. GRIER HOME - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Will walks in to find his wife, LISA (26) sitting up in bed with her eyes closed. He takes a seat on his side of the bed. She has no words.
C: WILL
D: LI
N: You okay?
C: LISA
D: O
N: Just praying for us.
C: WILL
D: N
N: It’s the last time, Lis. If I
T: don’t make this cut--
N: SG
C: LISA
D: Will, you’ve said that for 3 years now. How many more times are you gonna say it? AT
C: WILL
D: This time it’s different, I know it is... Been making real strides with the Special Teams unit. E
N: Lisa falls silent and gives Will a look of deep angst.
C: WILL
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: I was gonna wait until after practice today...
N: Lisa grabs a letter from inside the night stand and hands it to Will. His eyes quickly race through it, fear sets in.
C: WILL
D: How long have you had this?
C: LISA
D: A few weeks... Maybe more.
C: WILL
D: Lisa, you gotta tell me when things are goin’ bad like this.
C: LISA
D: I thought I could figure it out while you focused on making the team. My mom can’t give us any more money, Will.
E: beat
N: Lisa exits the room.
C: LISA
D: I gotta get James ready.
E: CONT'D
C: WILL
D: LI
N: Lisa! O
S: 7 INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Lisa readies for breakfast, Will follows close behind. N
C: WILL
D: You can tell me anything, you know SG
N: that, right?
C: LISA
D: Will, I’m scared. We’re maxed out and got a growin’ stack-a-bills AT
N: that just aren’t going away...
C: WILL
D: I’m gonna take care of all that-- E
C: LISA
D: What about insurance for James’ medicine? Or a school that can handle his needs?? Dreams don’t pay bills. And unless we get some good news, like today, they’re gonna throw us outta here! I was thinkin’ James could stay in Arizona with my mother while I see if I can get my old job back...
E: cold beat beat
C: WILL
D: Lisa, listen to me. No one’s-
N: James walks in shaking off sleep, and Will’s tone softens.
C: WILL
D: Hey, Buddy. Want some breakfast?
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: James, sweetie, go sit down at the table, okay?
E: wiping tears
N: James sits at the table while Lisa pulls it together, grabs a bowl and some cereal. Will joins her by the cupboard.
C: LISA
D: You gotta leave or you’re going to be late.
E: CONT'D
C: WILL
D: I love you.
C: LISA
D: LI
C: I love you.
D: They kiss. Will then kisses the FOOTBALL LOCKET around her O
N: neck-- She watches him exit, and kisses the football locket too. Will smiles, turns toward the front door, and crumples up the notice she gave him. N
S: 8 INT. RUSH DANIEL’S MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - SAME
N: SG In a bedroom fit for a king, CLOSE ON: EMERALD EYES, a MAN running is reflected back. We hear speeding steps on a
C: WHIRRING treadmill--
D: AT
N: NOW CLOSE ON: SHOES pounding on treadmill. We slowly PAN UP to reveal: Horrific scars on gigantic ankles and knees. We PULL BACK to admire this man’s sheer physicality-- Rippling back muscles, bruised and scarred from battle and time. E He’s a modern day gladiator, but we’ll come to know him as RUSH DANIELS (38). Behind him, a shapely beautiful Latino woman, CARLA (25) lays in a opulent silk robe and watches from the bed. In front of Rush, his AGENT stands nervously..
C: RUSH’S AGENT
D: Rush, they’ve offered to keep you around on a 1-year deal-- Granted they move you to Special Teams, you agree to be a good presence in the locker room... And play for the league minimum.
E: uncomfortable beat
N: Rush angrily punches the off button, abruptly shutting down the high speeding rubber conveyor belt-- He hops off the treadmill, grabs a towel and walks over to a balcony-- Which overlooks an Olympic sized swimming pool.
C: RUSH
D: So now I’m a charity case... Ungrateful motherfuckers.
N: The Agent awkwardly steps away as Rush broods. Rush softens when Carla slinks over and wraps her arms around him.
S: 9 INT. OLD FORD BRONCO - A LITTLE LATER
N: Will navigates the freeway traffic listening to sports radio. As he drives, Will notices smoke starting to spew from under the car hood-- He takes a look at the dash and shakes his head. The engine temperature light is bright red. LI Will ignores the light and turns up the radio... O
C: ESPN RADIO HOST
D: We’re back with LA QB, Peter Crane. Pete, Danno and I feel you guys N
E: V.O.
N: have a great chance of finally making the playoffs this year. SG
C: PETER CRANE
D: I knew you guys would come around.
E: V.O.
C: ESPN RADIO HOST
D: Now you lose Marquees Jackson to AT
E: V.O.
N: retirement and your #1 wide-out, J.T. Winslow, is out for the year with a torn ACL... What are you going to do for receivers? We’re hearing a rumor that All Pro E receiver Derrick Snow might be coming to LA.
C: WILL
D: Why we lookin’ at receivers? Throw to ME!
E: under his breath
C: PETER CRANE
D: We’re always looking to pick up a few weapons.
E: V.O.
N: Will pulls past the SECURITY GATE of the LOS ANGELES FOOTBALL practice facility. The lot is filled with EXPENSIVE CARS.
S: 10 EXT. LA PRACTICE FACILITY - MINUTES LATER
N: Will walks away from his car as the engine rattles and oozes smoke-- He heads to the building with a DUFFLE BAG over his shoulder, walking past SLIM SANDERS (32, likable and lanky veteran tight end), dealing with a standoffish woman, CHARISSE in an SUV. Slim and his young SON laugh and wave at each other until-- Charisse cuts this father-son moment off by cruelly rolling up the boy’s tinted window. Slim now turns to her...
C: CHARISSE
D: You need to read the papers, Slim. You know exactly what the court said. Best believe you’ll being hearin’ from my attorney! LI
N: Slim watches longingly as she speeds off, defeated. Will approaches the building, there’s MEDIA everywhere. O Reporters swarm the handsome quarterback/leading man, PETER CRANE (30s) and follow his every step. N Rush peacocks in colorfully expensive workout gear, diamond earrings and Oakley sunglasses. Rush can’t avoid the media buzz either... SG
C: VARIOUS REPORTERS
D: Rush Daniels!! Are you retiring after the season?? Is there any movement on the case??? AT
N: Will walks through the noise, going completely unnoticed.
S: 11 INT. LA FACILITY - LOCKER ROOM - LATER
N: E In a busy locker room, Will straps on his pads. Nearby he notices Slim slumped over and depressed by his locker.
C: WILL
D: Hey Man, you good?
N: Slim has no idea who he is, but appreciates the genuine concern.
C: SLIM
D: Yeah, I’m cool. Thanks.
N: COACH BRACKNEY (50, aging badly) enters with KENNY DAVIS (25) his assistant coach, both holding clipboards.
C: COACH BRACKNEY
D: Listen up! We’ll announce our 53- man roster after practice today. I wanna thank everyone in this room for your hard work throughout camp. For some of you, it’ll be the end of the road here... But hopefully not the end of your NFL journey!
S: 12 EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY - MINUTES LATER
N: The hitting is fast, hard and punishing. ANGLE ON - WILL running routes with precision. Will has good hands and good speed, but the CHEERS always seem to be for another player, DESHAWN WASHINGTON (26). Then a WHISTLE BLOWS indicating a break. LI
S: 13 EXT. SIDELINES - A MINUTE LATER
N: O Dozens of players have collected for a water break. Among them, we notice FOUR PLAYERS chatting by a Gatorade barrel-- N Rush holds court with Slim and MOUSE (27, Mohawk, a volatile, SG wild-eyed cornerback) and JOHN (30s, a stocky full-back). Will walks up to get water, but he’s blocked by DeShawn. Will tries to get by, he’s stopped again.
C: DESHAWN
D: AT
N: Man, you should be handing out my water, not drinking it.
C: WILL
D: What d’you say to me? E
N: DeShawn turns and faces Will closely.
C: DESHAWN
D: Time to take off them glass slippers... Only one of us finna makin’ this team, and it ain’t you.
C: WILL
D: Y’worried about somethin’, DeShawn?
C: DESHAWN
D: Worried? Man, you sorry as fuck.
N: DeShawn JABS at Will’s shoulder pad. Will pushes him back. Amid conversation with Slim and Mouse, Rush takes notice, and elbows Mouse.
C: RUSH
D: Young Boy got scrap.
N: Will and DeShawn grab each other’s face masks. Then...
C: ASST. COACH DAVIS
D: G-d Damnit! Break it up! Punt Team, Special Teams, live drill... Let’s go!
E: then
N: 14 The two units run out onto the field. The ball is snapped and the punter kicks it high into the air... DeShawn waits to receive the punt. Will knows this could be his last moment of pro football. His “nice guy” demeanor is replaced by something darker as he races down the field... DeShawn catches it and runs forward-- LI DeShawn makes a move with the ball, but is held up by a defender-- Then, Will hits him with such merciless force that O DeShawn’s knee SNAPS while contorting from the blow. DeShawn goes down hard and SCREAMS-- Rush takes notice. N WHISTLES BLOW as DeShawn writhes in pain, holding his knee. His season is over as trainers hustle over. As Will walks away, a storm of emotions fill up his eyes. What has he done? SG
S: 15 EXT. F.B.I. - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
N: At a conference table Deputy Head DON KIZINSKI (50’s) and a AT GROUP OF AGENTS watch Section Chief TED WALKER (60’s) speak by a projector. It displays photos from a Boston BANK HEIST. SUDDENLY-- Vidal bursts into the room with a stack of papers, breathless and disheveled. She takes a seat and E flips through papers.
C: WALKER
D: You’re all dismissed.
N: The lights flick on and Agents stand up to leave.
C: KIZINSKI
D: Good morning, Agent Vidal. You’re only an hour late.
E: checks watch
N: Walker and Kizinski head toward the door-- Vidal springs out of her chair to block their path. “WAIT!”. Agents slow to leave listen in-- Including one unassuming and hard working agent, DEBORAH HENNESSY (20s).
C: VIDAL
D: Sir, I have something and it’s big. The Victor Hyman mansion robbery.
E: off Kizinski’s look
C: KIZINSKI
D: The football team owner in Miami?
C: VIDAL
D: Exactly.
C: WALKER
D: Today’s briefing was on the Premier One Bank heist in Boston.
C: VIDAL I know.

C: VIDAL
D: Last year there were 4 armed N
E: CONT'D
N: robberies that have gone ice cold, including our Boston bank heist. SG Vidal clicks and images of the crimes appear on the screen.
C: VIDAL
D: Each different in nature, in distant cities around the AT
E: CONT'D
N: country... So distant, no one’s looked into them being connected. But I believe that’s precisely what connects them. E Vidal hands Walker a report, his eyes scan the document.
C: VIDAL
D: I took the liberty of extensively researching possible links.
E: CONT'D
C: WALKER
D: And?
C: VIDAL
D: We received a partial hit on a ballistics report. Some of the ammunition found at the Victor Hyman mansion appears to have been used at the bank heist in Boston.
C: WALKER
D: No shit...
C: VIDAL
D: Doesn’t end there. Each of these robberies had the same number of assailants, 4.
E: clicks past a few slides
N: Footage from MIAMI CCTV and semi-truck DASH CAM footage play side by side. The action is strikingly similar.
C: VIDAL
D: Multiple witnesses have described them as aggressive and athletic.
E: CONT'D
N: The CCTV and DASH CAM footage simultaneously show a dark figure sprint out of the frame. LI
C: VIDAL
D: These aren’t your run of the mill O
E: CONT'D
N: criminals. They’re professionals.
C: KIZINSKI
D: N
N: Still doesn’t explain the distance.
C: VIDAL
D: SG
N: I’m working on it.
C: WALKER
D: Vidal... This is great. AT
E: to Kizinski
N: Let’s get Special Agent Salaam on this. (to Vidal) I’ll need you to catch him up to speed. E Walker and Kizinski exit the room, both oblivious to Vidal’s disappointment. As the door closes behind them, her determination burns disappointment into fiery resolve.
S: 16 INT. LA FACILITY - LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Freshly showered FOOTBALL PLAYERS mill about, having fun. Will walks out of the shower with a towel on-- BANG! A locker slam spooks Will, he turns to see the stocky fullback angrily pack his stuff in a bag. Will takes a seat at his locker, watching Slim and Mouse console John... Another person cut, gulp. Rush walks up and hands John a gym bag.
C: RUSH
D: J, this for you and your family.
N: Will turns back to his locker and minds his own business. He checks his phone to see multiple missed calls from Lisa.
C: RUSH
D: Will Grier.
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: Will looks up to see RUSH and almost falls out of his seat.
C: WILL
D: Rush Daniels..? You know my name?

D: Small world! Aight, I see it now. Be good havin’ another baller around!
C: WILL
D: Not sure I’ll be around much longer.
C: RUSH

C: ASST. COACH DAVIS
D: Grier! Coach wants to see you!
E: O.S.
N: Will stands up.
C: RUSH
D: He didn’t ask you to bring your playbook? That’s a good sign. Will daps up Rush one more time, and quickly gets dressed. LI
E: whispers/winks
S: 17 INT. HALLWAY - COACH BRACKNEY’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER
N: WILL approaches the half-open door and sees Coach Brackney standing in front of his desk. Will puts his back against the O wall and nervously waits. We can’t see who’s the other voice.
C: COACH BRACKNEY
D: N
N: Look, I expect you to be mad--
C: VOICE
D: SG
E: O.S.
N: Mad? Try pissed the fuck off! Ten years in the league and you still treat me like a damn 7th round pick! I got four fucking kids, man. I’ve been banking on this roster bonus. AT
C: COACH BRACKNEY
D: Listen 73, I only wish the best for you and your family... But you and I both know this is a business. E
N: Either you stay and help bring the kid around or we gotta cut you... Footsteps approach. Will puts his head down and gets bumped by the man exiting, S-BULL, (34) a Samoan, thick-necked, gargantuan lineman swats him aside like a fruit-fly.
C: COACH BRACKNEY
D: Grier! Shut the door behind you.
E: CONT'D then
N: Will enters apprehensively and the door closes.
S: 18 EXT. GRIER HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Will arrives and Lisa goes outside to meet him. She raises an eyebrow... For a moment he looks dejected, then a big SMILE spreads across Will’s face.
C: LISA
D: I knew it! I knew you’d make it!
N: She hugs and kisses him.
C: WILL
D: Now things can change week to week. You know, “Last man on the roster, first to go” type-a-thing.
C: LISA

S: 20 INT. F.B.I. - WALKER’S OFFICE - DAY

N: Vidal nods and holds up the folder, but holds it back...
C: VIDAL
D: Sir, I’d like to discuss the handling of this investigation.
C: SALAAM
D: Should I leave?

C: WALKER
D: Alright then, show me what you got. Widen the parameters for high-line crews, nationwide, last four years. E

E: off Rush’s curious look
C: RUSH

S: 36 EXT. SOUTH CENTRAL - CUSTOM CAR REPAIR SHOP - NIGHT
N: In a dangerous alley a 64 CAMARO parks behind a repair shop. From the shop’s rough appearance it’s safe to say this ain’t E AAA approved. Police sirens and dog barks permeate the air. Rush steps out of the car, THEN-- A very familiar Bronco pulls out of the garage. Rush locks eyes with the driver and sees it’s... TOMMY. The Bronco squeals out, leaving Rush to ponder, but a high pitched laugh breaks his train of thought... Rush turns to see DONTAY (40s, a man with natural menace), walk out of the garage with a devilish grin. Dontay tosses Rush a baked potato... Rush catches it, confused, then follows Dontay through repair shop’s rear entrance.
S: 37 INT. FORD BRONCO - A FEW WEEKS LATER

S: 38 INT. NASHVILLE - CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Will, Rush, Slim, Mouse, and S-Bull hang in the VIP section of a high-end nightclub. Beautiful ladies dressed-to-kill turn heads as they walk by. Will is the least dressed-up for the E club, and appears the most uncomfortable.

S: 39 INT. VAN - DRIVING - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER
N: N The crew parks in a DARK PARKING LOT. They’re facing a SG storefront about 50 yards away with no lights. The mood is rowdy, almost juvenile, as if they’re about to play a prank. Mouse hops out of the back and starts dressing. Rush reaches into a bag and hands out masks. Will is speechless, things are happening too fast for him to truly process. AT
C: RUSH
D: Take this. E
N: Rush hands Will a ski mask and a GLOCK. Will’s shook...
C: RUSH
D: Yo chill, just follow our lead.

C: RUSH
D: No one’s gettin’ hurt, relax. We’re just gonna scare em.
E: CONT'D
N: Rush then motions for Will to follow. The Masked Men jog across the parking lot to the back of a DARK BUILDING... Rush pulls out a screw driver and approaches a LOCKED DOOR. CLOSE ON a BUMP KEY in a lock, as the handle of a screwdriver TAPS GENTLY on the top of the makeshift key and CLICK. *INTERCUTTING AS NECESSARY THROUGHOUT THE SEQUENCE. 40 The crew enters through the back door, and down a steep flight of stairs to a basement DOOR. Rush turns to the crew, nods and opens the door to reveal: 41 A dimly-lit narrow hallway, with a dozen doors on each side... The eerily quiet hallway is overtaken by the instrumental sounds of ancient eastern meditation music. Rush gently opens a door where a half naked pot-bellied GEEZER lies on a table with his eyes closed. Next to him a Vietnamese WOMAN in a silk robe gently starts to massage him-- She looks at Rush, who menacingly brings his index finger to LI his mouth, and gives her the universal “Shhh” sign. The crew continues down the dingy hallway as we hear “the moans and groans” of pay-for-sex, then... O Rush pushes a door open-- It leads to more hallways... Rush nods at Mouse and Slim to enter. N
C: RUSH
D: That’s you two. Look for the SG
E: CONT'D

E: CONT'D to Will
N: Off that, Rush lines up his foot and BLAM! E
S: 42 INT. POKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Double doors KICK OPEN. The THREE MASKED ASSAILANTS EXPLODE into the room. Will’s eyes go BIG as: Startled faces of EIGHT WEALTHY ELDERLY MEN around a green felt POKER TABLE with LARGE STACKS OF CASH in front of each player, stare back at them, terrified. TWO formidable BALD BOUNCERS in suits charge the crew. S-BULL gives a vicious FOREARM SHIVER that sends one bouncer off his feet. The giant Samoan follows through and pancakes the bouncer against the wall. The other bouncer comes rushing at them with a STUN STICK, but Rush is too fast. He ducks under the parry, kicks out the man’s legs and slams him in the groin. Rush picks up the STUN STICK and JOLTS him. Player #1 goes for his weapon, but Will’s got him-- Will points the Glock at Player 1’s temple, who backs away from the gun. Will grabs the gun and hands it over to Rush. PANIC ensues throughout the brothel, as Asian WOMEN and their CLIENTS scatter about in the hallway. A SECURITY GUARD appears from a hallway, and fires his gun. S-Bull ducks for cover, and returns aim at the guard. Rush aims his shotgun at the guard too-- The security guard drops his gun. With the room now secure Rush moves to the next phase.. LI
C: RUSH
D: Facedown, arms spread! O
E: to Will
N: Get the van and pull up! Will takes off and we follow as: Will sprints through the N dingy hallway, and back up the steps. He weaves and dodges panicked Women and Clients. The half naked Geezer bumps into Will-- He instinctively SLAMS the Geezer hard into the wall. SG Rush orders a guard to lay flat on his stomach.

E: CONT'D
C: PLAYER #2
D: Uh-um, quarter million. E
E: petrified
N: 43 Down a hallway, Mouse leads with Slim trailing. They cut through a kitchen. Mouse spots a camera and BLASTS it on site. They approach a WALK-IN FREEZER and open it up. They walk to the back of the freezer... Slim pushes a tall cart of POTATOES out of the way to reveal: a secret DOOR. Slim opens the door to a HALLWAY. At the end of the hallway, a GUARD stands in front of a locked steel door. Before the GUARD can react BOOM! Mouse blasts his kneecap into oblivion, he reloads, and BLASTS the door lock off. 44 Rush has everything under control, the poker players practically pee their collective pants.
C: RUSH
D: Everybody slide back from the table. You wanna call my bluff?!
E: off one’s hesitation
N: The players vigorously shake their heads no. S-Bull now aggressively packs $2 million into a bag. 45 Will bursts out of the back, sprints through the quiet parking lot, and hops in the van. He slams the door and starts the engine... 46 Mouse opens the door to reveal: a room of GIRLS in lingerie standing around a table of CASH. They stop stacking money and take cover under the table, terrified. Slim runs in and starts stuffing a bag with cash. Mouse walks up to a GIRL who’s shaking, scared and lost-- He drops a bag in front of her and orders, “Fill it up.” She obeys and quickly starts stuffing bills into the bag. 47 S-Bull finishes with the money and zips up the bag. Rush keeps a gun aimed on the poker players as he backs out of the LI room with S-Bull. 48 Slim zips up his bag and takes off. The Girl finishes and O zips the bag. She raises up it to Mouse... He shakes his head, “Take it and go!” Mouse follows Slim out... N *DIRECTOR’S PRODUCTION NOTE, TIME PERMITTING: We’ll see the escape van pull up to a stop light-- As they nervously wait, a COP CAR pulls up. It’s a beat of pure tension, then red SG and blue lights turn on-- The cops peel out with a U-Turn and drive the opposite way... PHEW.
S: 49 INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER
N: AT The crew sits on beds, happily counting cash, except for Will, who stands in the corner, enraged-- Rush notices...

D: Grier! Let’s go!
N: HOLY SHIT... The moment Will’s been fighting for has come-- Any anxiety from the massage parlour gets evaporated by heart pounding adrenaline.

C: PETER CRANE
D: Better have magnets in your gloves, kid. LI

Rush cocks his AR-15 followed by Slim, Mouse and Will with a loud simultaneous, CHUCHAK. Will notices his knee bouncing and halts it. Deep breath. Rush nods at Will and CLICK-CLICK. The SUV unlocks. AT The three passenger doors pop open and with it, time slows...
S: 116 EXT. TUNNEL - FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: E HIGH SPEED: Under the fluorescent orange glow of the tunnel light-- Rush, Slim, Mouse and Will walk out looking like the four horsemen of the apocalypse. The visual is ICONIC. The armed thieves prowl through the rows of traffic, lions on the hunt. 117 DOWN THE ROAD-- 100 yards past the tunnel, the broke down car that caused traffic gets pushed to the shoulder. The lanes free up and cars finally jolt forward. On the other side of the lane, headed toward us, we notice an AMBULANCE... 118 To the right of S-Bull a tatted up MAN in a pimped out CHALLENGER, glares right at him. The man leans down and reaches under his seat. This causes S-Bull to lower his window and the man lowers his.
C: S-BULL
D: Yo Homie, now’s not the time to be a hero... We not here for that.
N: S-Bull raises a glock for good measure. The man concedes. 119 Rush crosses to the left and crouches down to avoid the Body Guard’s eye line. He lines the SUV in his cross-hairs and signals for Slim and Mouse to advance forward.
C: RUSH
D: Rook, take the back. On my signal, light it up.
N: Cars in front of the armored VAN move forward. Will creeps up behind the SUV. In the BG screams permeate the tunnel as people begin to realize what’s happening. LI Through the front windshield Guard 1 and Guard 2 see Mouse and Slim creep up to the armored van. O

N: Braaap-Braap-Braap-Braap-Braap! The SUV’s driver side and rear window explode. Rush’s cold eyes glow from the hot AT muzzle flash, as he unloads a symphony of bullets and paints the SUV with smoking lead. Slim and Mouse take out the VAN’s tires, POP-POP! The van accelerates, it’s smoking tires squeal forward and the van E SLAMS into a car with reckless abandon. The tunnel erupts into absolute CHAOS. It’s a fight for survival as vehicles transform into bumper cars. 120 MEANWHILE at the FBI Field Office, Vidal, Hennessy and the Field Agent study a collage of targets pinned on a corkboard.
C: VOICE
D: Shots fired, shots fired. 10-65 in progress at the MacArthur Tunnel. Calling all units.

C: RUSH
D: I wanna see your hands!
N: Rush opens the driver door and grabs Guard 1 by the neck. Will keeps Guard 2 and Guard 3 frozen stiff with his gun trained on both of them.

Will has a clear shot on the Van Passenger, WHAM! Slim knocks the passenger out with the butt of this gun. AT Slim zip ties the passenger’s arms behind his back, and pats around till finding a key... Rush and Will have Guard 2 and 3 dead to rights. Rush barks E orders with fierce authority. Guard 2 carefully exits the SUV, then Rush tosses zip ties to Will...
C: RUSH
D: Tie him up!
N: 122 Meanwhile Slim unlocks the back door of the armored van and steps inside, revealing: The metal mobile safe with 6 locked compartments... Slim pulls out an industrial strength power drill from his backpack. He lines up the drill on the first compartment... The drill begins to twirl and BZZZZZZZ, slowly pushing into the thick steel. Metal shavings fall from the smoking hole. 123 In front of S-Bull, a path begins to form and he readies his foot over the gas pedal. 124 Police sirens in the distance steadily approach... Rush appears behind Slim at the back of the van--
C: RUSH
D: We gotta move!

Slim moves to the next compartment while Mouse starts sliding stacks of cash into his backpack. AT 127 Rush digs his gun into Guard 3’s back, he wails in pain. Rush pulls out a zip tie and ties him up. 128 Will’s eyes process the half mile of chaos. People scatter like cockroaches in the light. Will gets distracted when the E TAHOE engine REVS and ROARS. He turns to see: S-Bull punch the gas-- The Tahoe swerves left, swerves right and snakes through the traffic. A car pulls in front of him, partially blocking his next move... S-Bull accelerates and PLOWS through it! The SUV breaks free, and whooshes past the roadside robbery.

N: 129 Will’s attention snaps from S-Bull’s great escape to Mouse.

C: RUSH
D: Shit.
N: 131 S-Bull passes the stuck AMBULANCE and eventually clears the tunnel. He takes the first road leading into the woods... 132 At the other end of the tunnel a swarm of COP CARS are stuck at the entrance, blocked from any chance of getting in. LI Vidal, Hennessy, and the Field Agent step out an unmarked car wearing bullet proof vests-- They charge down the tunnel as O screaming pedestrians run past them. 133 The drill continues to BZZZZZ and POP-- The compartment N opens.

N: Rush fumes with anger and anxiously backs away. Mouse returns to see Slim still drilling.
C: MOUSE
D: You dumb mother fucker. Let’s go!
N: 134 It’s chaotic, camera shaky as: Feet pound down the street. Under the orange glow of tunnel light-- Vidal, Hennessy, and a group of cops are in full sprint. 135 Through a thicket of wrecked cars, Rush spots the group of cops charging down the tunnel. He lines up his AR-15 and applies suppression fire, Braap- Braap-Braap! The cops fall to the ground and take cover.
C: RUSH
D: Rook, let’s go!

N: Rush doesn’t see it, and keeps sprinting... Slim turns back, and starts picking up the spilled cash-- Hennessy rises up behind a smoking car, BANG-BANG! LI One bullet pings off the van and one nails Slim in the leg. He topples over and falls onto the pile of cash. O Rush turns to see Slim crawling through bloody stacks of cash.

C: MOUSE
D: Go-go-go. I’ll cover you!
E: to Rush

N: that fucking plane. For your son, Slim. You hear me?! Gotta make it out of this tunnel for your son. N Slim perks up and nods his head. He’s got this. Rush helps Slim up and time slows. SG 139 Shot out of a cannon, Slim sprints through the fluorescent tunnel. Numb to the pain as adrenaline carries him forward. It’s pure chaos-- Camera shaky as Cops from every angle take aim at Slim and Rush. Bullets ping all around them. AT 140 Mouse pivots around the car and fires at the swarm of cops, Braap-Braap-Braap-Braap! Vidal dives down for cover. 141 Will hops over the median, and sprints through cars to the E AMBULANCE. He rips the door open to find a PARAMEDIC texting. She screams and drops her phone. Will grabs a first-aid kit, and takes off. 142 Will sprints up the road, takes a sharp right into the woods, and exits the chaos... 143 In the Tahoe, S-Bull drives along the quiet woods and pulls over to his marked location. 144 Slim sprints through the rows of cars. Rush follows behind with Mouse making up some ground. 145 CLOSE ON: HENNESSY’s FACE. We pull out to see her bloody, and lifeless body slumped against the median. With eyes full of anger and sadness, Vidal attempts to stop the bleeding from her lifeless partner. She rips the sleeve off her shirt, and ties it around Hennessy’s wound. Vidal screams out words like “PARAMEDIC”, STAY WITH ME” and “HELP”. 146 In the woods, Rush and Mouse carry Slim. With the adrenaline worn off, he’s no longer able to move. Slim’s starting to faint from the loss of blood. 147 The SUV’s parked on a shoulder. In the distance, a helicopter approaches with a search light scouring the area. In the SUV, S-Bull looks at his watch. Beats of silence feel like a lifetime... THUD. S-Bull sees Will through the rearview mirror. CLICK-CLICK. Will opens the trunk and lowers back seats to make room for a make shift hospital bed. LI
C: S-BULL
D: You guys good? O
N: Will doesn’t answer. N 148 In the tunnel, Vidal falls back against the median next to Hennessy. The emotion and exhaustion setting in. Cops storm past her in the hopeless pursuit of the criminals.

C: RUSH
D: I ever tell you about my ol’ man? Toughest cop in Detroit. They used to call him “The Ghost” cuz he'd always pop up in the middle of a crime, said he haunted the streets. Well one night he finds these young punks rippin’ off a liquor store. He chases one of 'em 18 blocks and corners him in an alley. The kid turns around and has a gun. Pop, he just freezes. He says, "Why, Son?" That young punk shrugged it all off and said, "I like the rush." My ol’ man, he just nodded and said, “Good.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: RUSH
D: From now on, that's your name, cuz you no longer deserve mine." I never saw him after that. Even when I went legit. High school ball. College. Even the pros. Muthafucka died 10 years ago and “The Ghost” still haunts me to this day.

N: (beat) And so is your family. You understand what I’m saying? Rush releases Will and wipes the glock off Will’s shoulders. Rush backs up a few steps... Will stares at him and nods. Will pulls out the Lambo keys and tosses them at Rush’s feet.

C: WILL
D: I fucked up. I was chasing what I thought was the dream. Dragging you and James all over the map only thinking of me...

N: Vidal pulls up in a black DODGE CHARGER with TWO COP CARS. Vidal jogs up the porch, followed by FOUR COPS in tactical gear. In contrast to the noisy stadium, this dead quiet neighbored is eerie-- Vidal knocks, BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. Vidal Mr. Sanders! The cops part like the red sea, a BIG COP storms up with a steel ram and blasts the door off it’s hinges. 180 The tactical cops sweep the house for any sign of life-- WE FOLLOW Vidal up a flight of stairs.

E: V.O.
N: Meanwhile, somewhere deep in the stadium’s employee TUNNEL, a MAN in a white painter suit, pushes a wheelbarrow toward a FREIGHT ELEVATOR-- He reaches the elevator, parks the wheelbarrow, and inserts a silver key into a slot...DING. The Painter enters, turns, finally revealing it’s RUSH. His face is hidden by a black ski mask with a white and chrome painter respirator mask over it. 185 TRAINING ROOM, Will’s helped onto the trainer’s table by S- Bull and Mouse. They exit and give Will a nod. The TRAINER starts to feel his hamstring.
C: TRAINER

FREIGHT ELEVATOR, Slim and Mouse appear from a corner and join Rush. The air’s filled with rhythmic ventilated breathing as they wait... AT *Through the painter masks their voices have a reverberated muffle quality to it, a less extreme version of BANE’s voice. 188 Finally Will appears down the hall and makes it to the elevator. Once inside Rush pushes a button, the doors shut, E and a mechanical whir initiates their deep descent into the stadium’s bowels. Will’s anxious eyes watch: Rush dig under the tarp in the wheelbarrow and pull out FOUR SILENCER PISTOLS-- He hands one to Slim, Mouse and Will, who studies it with some “oh shit” type curiosity.
C: RUSH

N: The long whir stops with a THUD. The doors slide open. 189 We follow the ARMORED TRUCK as it passes a GATE GUARD, and through the GATED ENTRANCE. The van goes deeper and deeper into the belly of the stadium, leading to the VAULT. LI 190 BASEMENT 3 - PRIVATE ENTRANCE, it’s all concrete down here. Mouse pushes the wheelbarrow. Rush and S-Bull walk on either side of him with their SILENCERS, they turn a corner and see: O A chrome private ELEVATOR where a SECURITY GUARD watches the halftime show on a corner TV. N On Rush’s cold and focused face, he takes aim and pop-pop- pop. Will’s eyes go big, witnessing the cold blooded murder. SG Rush pulls out a key card, places it on a sleek panel, and waits while-- S-Bull picks up the guard and holds his face to the retina scanner... Double-Protected. After a few tense beats, the chrome elevator door opens. AT 191 CLOSE ON VAULT DOOR WHEEL. In the BG we hear a series of beeps then a loud metal THUNK-- The giant steel wheel spins and opens to reveal a money mausoleum. E In the middle, there’s four steel tables with every square inch covered in a 2 foot stack of CASH-- It’s enough to make Scrooge McDuck sweat. 192 Outside the vault, a TRUCK GUARD opens the back door of the Armored Truck to reveal: FIVE pallets of CASH-- Rush steps out of a dark corner and pop-pop, drops the guard. Spooked-- TWO GUARDS turn around and pop-pop-pop-pop. Just like that THREE guards down. From the dark corners of the concrete cave, Slim, Mouse and Will jog up. It’s frenetic yet focused-- The ticking clock weighs on them as the truck duo and vault duo fill up bags with cash. At this point it’s nothing short of efficient perfection... 193 OWNER’S BOX, Demarco sits next to the GM. He’s still fuming from the field goal.

CLOSE ON: PAVEMENT a full DUFFLE BAG lands with a THUD next N to another FULL BAG-- IN the BG we see a GUARD slowly move. 195 FLOOR V - LOBBY, Will breathes hard, as he drags the bag SG across the floor. He almost falls from the weight on his back. He stops to catch a breath and notices how isolated and quiet it is... Suddenly he gets an idea.. Will walks over to a trash can, pulls the bag and dumps all the trash out. Next, he unzips both bags and starts pulling AT cash evenly from each bag... His eyes dart around wildly as he stuffs the trash bag with cash. Will pulls a chair up to a giant LA FOOTBALL EMBLEM, lifts E the ceiling panel and places the garbage bag in there-- Lastly, Will pulls out a BURNER PHONE and takes a picture of the EMBLEM... 196 STADIUM - ON THE FIELD, the crowd roars as LA kicks off to begin the second half.... 197 PRIVATE ENTRANCE ROAD, the Gate Guard drives down the steep dark tunnel in a Security CART.
C: GATE GUARD
D: Hey Ralph, what’s going on down there? You’re 5 minutes behind. 198 In the truck, S-Bull zips the last bag and tosses it to the ground. S-Bull then looks up to see Mouse--
E: into radio
C: S-BULL
D: Yo Mouse, you goo- Pop. S-Bull falls forward and SMACKS face first onto the concrete next to his duffle bag... Rush steps out from the shadows and hops out of the truck-- But the shocking moment is cut by a pair of headlights...
N: 199 Down the ramp, the Gate Guard anxiously approaches in his Security Cart... He sees the trail of blood and dead Guard. The cart reverses back as fast as it can-- Mouse and Rush both unload their SILENCERS, pop-pop-pop-pop. Every shot misses as the cart whips around and disappears up the ramp. 200 FLOOR V - LOBBY, Will stands by the elevator... A WHITE STROBE LIGHT FLASHES with a high-pitched alarm ringing throughout the concrete cave. Will looks around, panicked. LI Around the corner, Rush comes sprinting, followed by Mouse pushing the wheelbarrow. O

N: 201 Now with Vidal’s CHARGER, there’s a swarm of COP CARS trailing behind... In the passenger seat, Vidal stares at the STADIUM where it all ends. 202 DING. The elevator opens. Mouse pushes ahead with the wheel E barrow, followed by Rush and Will each dragging a bag out. As Will pulls his first bag out, he notices the TV in the corner. It’s the MIDDLE OF THE 3rd QUARTER!!! 203 At Lisa’s Mom’s house, Lisa sits anxiously, BUZZ-BUZZ. She looks over to see a TEXT from a random number... Too anxious to look at it, she turns the phone over. 204 WE FOLLOW MOUSE wheeling into the DRAINAGE tunnel. The area’s a damp industrial maze of pipes going every which way. This area should be pitch black, but the STROBE LIGHT pulses like a heart beat-- Mouse sees down the long tunnel, SUN LIGHT streaming through a 6 x 6 IRON STEEL GRATE... As Mouse approaches, he sees through the GRATE, a field of grass and a BLACK SUV with CARLA opening the trunk doors. Mouse wastes no time, and pulls out a hand WET SAW from the wheelbarrow and fires it up-- BZZZZZZ. 205 Will drags the bag toward the drainage tunnel. In the BG we hear the sounds of COPS arriving near the elevator area. Rush drags his last bag toward the silhouette of Mouse in a shower of hot glowing sparks... Then we hear a loud CLANG. Mouse shuts off the saw and kicks the grate open. Midway through the final stretch, Will stops and breathes HEAVY through the ventilation mask. Will puts his hands on his knees for one final breath before the last push.
C: RUSH
D: Grier! Will looks up to see-- With sunlight shining through, the menacing dark silhouette of RUSH slowly approaches. Will LI

C: RUSH
D: E
N: Still haven’t caught on yet, huh? Will looks up with eyes big, now realizing too late.
C: RUSH
D: I thought I taught you good, Rook. But what’d I say? Deception, misdirection, surprise... BANG! Will’s shot in the chest. It’s a stunned reaction as another loud ROAR from the crowd erupts. BANG-BANG-BANG. Will fall’s back like a chopped tree onto his bag of money. Rush looks down at the limp body as the alarm light strobes.
E: CONT'D points gun
N: Rush grabs the bag off Will’s back and as he does, the painter mask gets hooked by the bag strap and pulls it off... Rush stumbles back in shock when TOMMY’s bleach blond hair pops out from under the ski mask-- the sound drowns out...

N 209 AT THE SUV, with a bag over his back, Mouse drags another bag SG across the grass as Carla watches on. He gets to the SUV and dumps each bag into the trunk. 210 Rush’s haunted face is frozen by the blind side deception. The sounds of COPS from the other end grows loader... AT
C: MOUSE
D: Rush! We gotta go!! Rush snaps out of it, looks toward the grate to see: MOUSE backpedaling with a bag on his back, dragging another bag. E
E: O.S.
N: Rush jogs to the grate, slings the last bag over his back. THEN he pulls TWO AR-15s from the wheelbarrow-- He slings one over his shoulder and carries the other out... 211 Rush now approaches the SUV, as Mouse finishes packing his last bag-- Rush lines the AR-15 up on Mouse’s head... That’s when Mouse looks in the rearview and notices Rush. Record scratch-- They both turn and see a COP CAR pull up in front of the SUV. Rush hands Mouse the other AR-15. They’ll have to talk about that later... If there is a later. From each side, COP 1 and COP 2 approach. Rush nods for Mouse to go left, he’ll go right... After some measured breathes-- They both pivot around the SUV and creep between parked cars, on the hunt--- COP 2 has an angle on RUSH. COP 1 has an angle on MOUSE, BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG! Rush takes cover as a series of PINGS and THUDS impact the car around him-- The SUV’s windshield and driver side window
C: CRACK, taking multiple hits.
D: On the other side, Mouse catches a bullet in the shoulder and falls back, wounded. RUSH pops over the hood-- Braap-Braap-Braaap! Cop 2’s tagged multiple times and he’s down.
N: Wounded and filled with adrenaline, Mouse hides between a row of cars and circles around to flank Cop 1, who’s taking cover behind his car... WHOOSH, Mouse blurs between cars and appears behind him-- Braap-Braap, he puts Cop 1 down. Mouse stumbles toward the SUV as Rush opens the passenger door to find Carla, lifeless and bloody... His eye’s enrage with hell-fire-- Just then, a fleet of FEDs, TACTICAL OFFICERS, and Vidal arrive on the scene. LI Oblivious to the new danger, Mouse opens the driver side door and pulls Carla out... Mouse then gets in the driver seat O and yells for Rush to, “GET IN!” But Rush ducks down, as they receive countless rounds of N fire... Brraaaap-Brraaap-Brraaaap-Brraaaap. Rush rises up through the smoky damage to see Mouse, covered in blood... Dead. SG Rush explodes with anger, unleashing return fire at the officers. He sends them scurrying behind cars. He now runs to the driver side door, and pulls out Mouse’s lifeless body, then takes the driver seat position... AT 212 VROOM! Rush peels out of the parking spot and swerves toward the exit... Meanwhile, Vidal and a team of tactical officers stream through the parking lot to cut Rush off-- E With tires squealing, Rush makes his way through the parking lot-- He sticks his AR-15 out the window and unloads fire at Police Officers attempting to cut him off, Brraaaap-Brraaap!! 214 STADIUM - ON THE FIELD, LA is in a hurry up offense.

E: O.S.
N: Will’s lined up, an intimidating cornerback stares at him, “GO!”-- Will sprints off the line, the cornerback manhandles him down the sideline. Crane drops back, searching for Will. Crane throws it but the cornerback has him every step of the way and tips the ball out of bounds. 215 Vidal makes it to the empty street and as she does-- RUSH’s SUV spills out. Vidal takes aim and empties her clip, she hits: the left tire and shatters the rear window. The SUV swerves, speeding through an intersection and BANG! The front of his SUV get’s T-BONED-- The SUV does a 180 spin and stops in the middle of the intersection, now facing VIDAL. The car horn blasts out, Brrrrrrrrrrr. The SUV is now a smoking, bullet-riddled heap. THROUGH the SUV’s windshield, you can’t see shit, just smoke. Rush raises his head and the car horn stops. He’s in bad LI shape and coughs up blood, almost laughing. With a mouth full of blood, Rush looks at the bag of cash O covered in broken glass, then looks through the windshield.. Through the smoke we see VIDAL approaching, gun aimed. N -HIGH SPEED: We 360 around Vidal... It’s a heroic moment as she finally cuts the head off the snake. SG 216 STADIUM - ON THE FIELD, In the huddle, Crane calls a play and “BREAK”. As they break we’re IN HIGH SPEED: Will runs to his spot and looks ahead at the Cornerback...

E: V.O.
N: Will points his foot slightly left and looks left. The cornerback clocks it.. 217 MIDDLE OF THE STREET, Standing now only 10 feet away, Vidal stares through the wispy smoke. She see’s Rush’s eyes staring right back. An officer approaches and tells her, “Vidal we just confirmed, he makes number four.” 218 INT RUSH CAR, Rush looks from Vidal to the seat next to him and sees the gun. He picks it up and reloads, CHUCHAK. In Rush’s car, we hear:

The football slowly spirals... In the corner of the end zone Will dives and CATCHES with both hands extended... He taps in both feet, TOUCHDOWN. 220 LISA’S MOM’S HOUSE, James jumps for joy and hugs his Mom. Lisa’s struck with disbelief and emotion.
