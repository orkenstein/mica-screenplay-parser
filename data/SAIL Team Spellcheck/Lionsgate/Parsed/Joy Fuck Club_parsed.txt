S: EXT./ESTAB. LAFAYETTE, INDIANA - 1998 - DAY *
N: A car drives down a pretty suburban road. CHYRON: 1998. *
S: INT. CAR - SAME
N: JOE SULLIVAN drives with his wife MARY in the passenger seat. They’re white, pleasant-looking, in their 40s.
C: JOE SULLIVAN
D: Well, Mary, I think it’s about time, don’t you think?
C: MARY SULLIVAN
D: I think so, Joe. What about you, Audrey? Mary turns around and we see her from a BACKSEAT POV. We hear their daughter, AUDREY .
E: age 4
C: AUDREY
D: Yes!
E: AGE 4 O.S.
C: MARY SULLIVAN
D: Okay!
C: MARY/JOE/AUDREY
D: A PLAYGROUND WE WILL GO / A PLAYGROUND WE WILL GO / WE’LL PET A DOG AND SIT ON A LOG AND THEN WE’LL
C: GO BACK HOME
D: OFF the car driving as the little family sings merrily...
S: EXT. PLAYGROUND - LATER
N: Several kids play in the sandbox and on the jungle gym as their parents look on. Everyone is Midwestern, wholesome, corn- fed, and white, except for... JENNY and WEY CHEN (early 30s) approach with their daughter LOLO (age 4). Jenny looks nervously to her husband.
C: JENNY CHEN
D: Look at all these white people.
E: subtitled, in Mandarin
C: WEY CHEN
D: I’ve never seen so many of them in one place before. It’s like a bar that has board games.
E: subtitled, in Mandarin
C: JENNY CHEN
D: Or an episode of Friends.
E: subtitled, in Mandarin
C: WEY CHEN
D: Indiana is like one giant episode of Friends. Lolo tugs at her Mom’s pant leg.
E: subtitled, in Mandarin
C: LOLO
D: I’m going to make a sandcastle! Lolo runs to the sandbox and starts digging with her toy pail and shovel. A little BOY comes up to her.
E: AGE 4 subtitled, in Mandarin
C: BOY
D: Ching chong ching chong choo! Lolo SLUGS him. The Boy yelps, rushing off to find his mother. The Chens look down at Lolo.
C: JENNY CHEN
D: Lolo...
C: LOLO
D: I know, I know. Sorry. Jenny and Wey can’t help but smile at their feisty daughter, then look up as Joe and Mary Sullivan approach.
E: AGE 4
C: JOE SULLIVAN
D: Hey there. You must be new in town!
C: JENNY CHEN
D: Sorry, are you the parents of that racist boy?
C: MARY SULLIVAN
D: Oh no. Just curious: Are you Chinese?
C: WEY CHEN
D: Yes...
E: warily, “here we go”
C: JOE SULLIVAN
D: Great! Do you mind if our daughter plays with your daughter?
C: JENNY CHEN
D: Why our daughter?
C: MARY SULLIVAN
D: Well... we thought Audrey might like to meet her. The Sullivans coax their daughter out from hiding behind them. It turns out Audrey, whose voice we heard earlier, is also Asian! Audrey’s eyes go wide at the sight of Lolo.
C: AUDREY
D: Hi.
E: AGE 4 shyly
C: LOLO
D: Hi, I’m Lolo, I’m four. Wanna play sandcastle? Audrey nods, yes. As the girls play... BEGIN STYLIZED MUSIC MONTAGE OF THE GIRLS GROWING UP: - The Chens and Sullivans send Audrey and Lolo to preschool, where they stand out amid their white classmates. Audrey looks a little scared until rambunctious Lolo grabs her hand and they head in, smiling. - Audrey and Lolo, now in grade school, stand among a group of * GIRL SCOUTS. Audrey’s uniform is perfect and her sash displays * DOZENS of badges; her TROOP LEADER hands her another one and * Audrey’s face lights up. Meanwhile, Lolo has no badges, eats * straight out of a box of Thin Mints, and wipes her chocolatey * fingertips on her uniform between bites. * - A ROAST HAM HITS THE TABLE. WIDER to see the Sullivans hosting the Chens for Christmas. Perfect table settings, super civilized. Audrey wears a cute J Crew dress; Lolo wears an oversize Champion t-shirt. The Sullivans say grace. - A ROAST DUCK HITS THE TABLE. WIDER to see the Chens hosting the Sullivans for Chinese New Year. The extended Chen clan is there , diving into the food in a mad scramble. Lolo and her mother are in matching qipaos. Audrey looks wistfully at how much they look alike. Then she shakes it off and wraps an arm around her mom, Mary. Mary beams. - High school. On a sign: “AUDREY FOR PRESIDENT!”. Audrey, 17, hands out stickers to classmates in the hall. Nearby, Lolo, 17, stands under a sign: “SENIOR ART SHOW”. She proudly displays a weird photograph of a cat that’s been altered with * splotches of paint, feathers, yarn, etc. People walking by * avert their eyes, disturbed. * - FLASH! Audrey, 21, in college has her picture taken as she receives a Top Scholar Award. More FLASHES as she receives various accolades: Student Bar Association! Captain of the * Crew Team! President of Chinese Students Association . - FLASH! Lolo, 21, nude and smeared with colorful paint, poses for an aggressively artsy photo. WIDEN TO REVEAL it was taken by a camera on a timer against a hastily-hung background. After a moment, Lolo’s mom Jenny enters with a laundry basket and tears down the background, revealing the washing machine behind it. She and Lolo get into an argument. * END SEQUENCE.
E: AGE 4 including Lolo’s weird, unblinking cousin DEADEYE, 10 with her * co-president, KAREN. We’ll see more of her later
N: CHYRON: “2021”
S: INT. WINSTON FREED & ASSOCIATES - NIGHT
N: Big giant law firm, dead of night. Silent and dark, except for a crack of light under one closed office door. We hear a faint PHONE ALARM...
S: INT. AUDREY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Multiple framed degrees and certificates hang on the walls of this immaculately-kept office, and a long line of AWARDS are neatly displayed on a shelf. On the desk, a name plate that reads “AUDREY HAN SULLIVAN” and photos of Audrey and her * parents. * UNDER THE DESK - curled up on the floor: AUDREY, now 27, is asleep in her work clothes. That is, until she finally hears her phone alarm. She grabs the phone and silences it. She * emerges from under the desk, shakes off the grogginess, and sits back in her chair, all business. Back to work!
T: QUICK CUTS of Audrey working:
N: 4AM: Audrey’s on a video call with a client in Berlin.
C: AUDREY
D: --Guten Tag, Fraulein Lingenfelter? I updated the Disclosure Schedules ahead of schedule. They’re good to go-- 7AM: A chipper Audrey greets a groggy associate, BECKETT, who has just come in.
E: INTO PHONE
C: AUDREY
D: Beckett! I went over your Blitz.com file-- some references were off, I went ahead and fixed them for you. Love the jacket, by the way, I’m gonna get another coffee, you want? You look like you want. She hands bleary Beckett the file as she exits. 10AM: In a conference room, Audrey and a senior partner, FRANK , meet with CLIENTS: *
E: CONT'D white, 50s, Midwestern
C: AUDREY
D: ...We'll push back on some of these terms-- they're way off-market.
E: CONT'D
C: CLIENT
D: Yes, but the Japanese firms have considerable capital, we don’t want to lose out--
E: worried
C: FRANK
D: I agree with Audrey, it’s worth a * shot. She’s obviously an expert on * Asian markets. * Audrey looks panicked for a split second-- she’s not an * expert, actually-- but then recovers and smiles, too used to * microaggressions like this to be offended. She nods, happy for * Frank’s approval. *
S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY (LATER)
N: Glasses CLINK as Frank pours champagne for Audrey and a few
C: ASSOCIATES. FRANK
D: Congratulations, team, on closing Heartland Poultry! Big shout-out to Audrey for taking the lead! Everyone cheers. Frank comes over to Audrey.
C: FRANK
D: Now that this is done you can roll onto the WestStar deal.
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY
D: Actually, I’m not going to be on that one. I’m leaving on vacation tonight-- Only because HR said I had to since I'm 600 hours over.
E: off his disappointment; quickly
C: FRANK
D: Right. Just too bad it’s happening at crunch time for us. You know, I shouldn’t be telling you this, but-- --I’m planning on backing you for partner. Audrey is stunned, delighted.
E: confiding
C: FRANK
D: But this vacation throws a wrench into things. Where are you going again?
E: CONT'D passive aggressive
C: AUDREY
D: Beijing. *
C: FRANK
D: Ah, China, isn’t that where you’re * from? *
C: AUDREY *
D: Well, I was born there, but I’m * from Indiana. *
C: FRANK *
D: Right, right. Chinese food is tough * for me. Too many flavors. * Audrey lets this comment roll right over her. *
C: AUDREY *
D: I’ll be back before you know it. * While I’m in China I can get even * more familiar with Asian markets. * And with regards to WestStar, I’m * back the day before the pitch. I can still lead the team, I’ll just prep while I’m in Beijing.
E: wants to be team player
C: FRANK
D: All right, you’re on. That’s future partner attitude. I love it. Audrey beams. *
C: AUDREY
D: You can always count on me to positively represent the firm--
C: LOLO
D: Heeeeeyyyyy Bitch!!! Audrey and Frank turn to see LOLO, 27, entering, in an outfit somehow tight and raggedy at the same time, and slept-in eye makeup. Audrey is surprised, a little embarrassed.
E: O.S.
C: LOLO
D: Who’s ready to vacay?! Hello lawyer. * Lawyers. * Audrey looks apologetically at Frank; good thing he’s merely amused .
E: CONT'D sees Frank sees everyone else and probably staring at Lolo’s booty shorts
S: INT. LOLO’S CAR - EVENING
N: In contrast to Audrey’s ultra-together vibe, Lolo is a hot mess and doesn’t give a shit. Her car is filled with photography equipment, paint cans, spools of yarn, wood * blocks, empty Cheetos bags and water bottles. She bounces * along to a track by Dumbfoundead as she drives.
C: AUDREY
D: You should have given me a heads up you were coming.
C: LOLO
D: I wanted to make sure your ass left work. You realize we haven’t taken a trip since you started this job?! * Pro tip for Beijing: try all the * wack fruits, they’re delicious. And * we gotta hit up a night market and * get jianbing, it’s basically like a * Chinese pancake-- what are you * doing? Audrey doesn’t answer, immersed in a work file. Lolo grabs it and chucks it in the back.
C: AUDREY
D: Hey?!
C: LOLO
D: That’s work. I could see it on your face, you had workface.
C: AUDREY
D: I just have to read this one thing. It’s a crazy time for the firm-
C: LOLO
D: Boo-boo, it’s always a crazy time.
C: We’re on VACATION. *
D: Audrey reaches back to get her work file, then sees amongst * the clutter in the backseat a large framed photo of a * cornfield splotched with paint, yarn strewn over it, etc. It’s * got a messy, cool vibe to it. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Hey, is this the one Cafe Zola let * you hang? Nobody bought it? *
C: LOLO *
D: Yeah, they said the customers * thought it was too distracting. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Distracting is good, that’s what * art is! They’re idiots! *
C: LOLO *
D: Yeah I already fucked up their Yelp * page. * Lolo notices that Audrey is looking back at her work file. *
C: LOLO
D: Hey. HEY! Stop thinking about work! * Don’t make me ear flick you-- Lolo starts ear flicking Audrey. Audrey tries to fend her off, laughing.
E: CONT'D
C: LOLO AUDREY
D: Ya like that? Ya like that, Stop! Fine, I’ll just work ya workaholic idiot! tonight! Keep your hands on the wheel, Jesus! You psycho! Off on the girls, play-slapping, laughing...
E: CONT'D
S: INT. SULLIVANS’ DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Audrey and Lolo sit with their parents, it’s an informal dinner. Audrey’s mother dramatically unveils a beautiful, homemade cake with “BON VOYAGE” written on top.
C: AUDREY
D: Aw, you didn’t have to do that! *
C: MARY SULLIVAN *
D: Of course we did, we want to * celebrate you! It’s a big deal, * going to your birth country. *
C: AUDREY *

C: JOE SULLIVAN *
D: Well, it’s a well-deserved * vacation. You work so hard. *
C: WEY CHEN *
D: * You hear that? She works hard. You * should try it sometime. * Lolo rolls her eyes: she’s heard this before. Jenny quickly * steps in to change the subject. *
E: to Lolo
C: JENNY CHEN *
D: So Audrey, how do you like your new * place in Chicago? *
C: AUDREY *
D: It’s nice! It’s small, but it’s * good to have my own space. *
C: LOLO *
D: She’s being modest, bitch has an in- * unit washer dryer! * * Your rent must be stupid high, what * is it? *
E: to Audrey
C: AUDREY *
D: It’s not that bad. *
C: WEY CHEN *
D: Well, congratulations, Audrey. * Maybe you can convince Lolo to move * out too. *
C: LOLO *
D: Why would I move out, I have an in- * unit washer dryer at home! * Everyone laughs, but Lolo’s parents keep poking. *
C: WEY CHEN *
D: You know, my co-worker’s daughter * just got into school to become a * dental hygienist. *
C: LOLO *

C: LOLO *
D: * Okay Mom! *
E: impressed
N: Mary brings out a box. *
C: MARY SULLIVAN
D: So, I thought it would be fun to see some pictures of Audrey the * last time she was in China! *
C: AUDREY
D: Oh, the Chens don’t want to-- But Mary is already passing out photos of baby Audrey in China being carried by a young Joe and Mary.
C: MARY SULLIVAN
D: Wasn’t she precious? This one’s the first time I ever held her-- oh my god, I’m going to cry...
C: JOE SULLIVAN
D: Oh, honey. Me too!
C: LOLO
D: Heh, you had a big old head. Adorable Chinese pumpkin baby. Audrey rifles absently through the box, which also holds old * keepsakes: folders, random paperwork, mostly in Chinese. Then she sees the edge of something sticking out of the box lining. It must have gotten stuck there. She pulls it out...it’s a faded photo of a YOUNG ASIAN WOMAN in a hospital gown, holding a newborn Audrey. The woman’s hair hides half her face; the other half is obscured by shadows. Audrey feels her breath catch... she turns the picture over to see her birthdate and the words “Birth Mother.” Mary notices.
E: looking at pics
C: MARY SULLIVAN
D: Oh! I thought we lost that picture--
C: LOLO
D: Who’s that?
C: MARY SULLIVAN
D: Audrey’s birth mother. It’s the only picture they had.
C: LOLO
D: Wow.
C: AUDREY
D: I’ve never seen this before. It was stuck to the side.
C: MARY SULLIVAN
D: Look at her. So young. I wish we could see her face better, I’m sure she was beautiful, just like you.
N: Audrey is overwhelmed from seeing the picture; she quickly * puts it aside. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Not as beautiful as you though! *
C: MARY SULLIVAN *
D: Stop, honey, you’re such a * sweetheart, okay I’m crying * again... * Joe puts an arm around her; she dabs at her eyes; Audrey * smiles at them both. This trio fucking loves each other. Lolo * takes a picture of the birth mom photo. *
C: LOLO
D: Remember we used to guess who your biological mom was? My money was on Lucy Liu, ‘cause she was the only
C: Chinese person on TV.
D: Audrey is uncomfortable with the topic of her birth mother. She puts the picture away:
C: AUDREY
D: Ha. Yeah. That was stupid. More cake, anyone? It’s clear Audrey wants to move on, but Lolo studies the picture of Audrey’s birth mom. *
E: then
C: LOLO
D: No offense, but...would bang.
S: EXT. LAX - DAY (ESTABLISHING) INT. LAX - INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - DAY
N: Audrey sits in a bustling terminal. She messages her parents: “Layover in LA! Boarding soon! (string of heart emojis)”. She * gets back to working on her laptop when Lolo collapses in the seat next to her.
C: LOLO
D: I tried sneaking into the lounge, * but that was a fail. Told them my name was Business McBusinessWoman, they were... not amused. Lolo looks over Audrey’s shoulder
C: LOLO
D: Ugh, stop WORKING! You’re such a Lawyer McLawyerlaw--
E: CONT'D MORE
C: LOLO
D: * --whatever. Hey. Check this out. * Lolo shows her phone to Audrey - it’s the photo of Audrey’s * birth mom, but painted over in an artsy way. *
E: CONT'D losing steam, then
C: AUDREY *
D: Oh. That’s... interesting. *
C: LOLO *
D: It’s cool that you actually know * what she looks like now, right? * * Hey, now that we’re going to China, * maybe we could look for her. Is * that crazy? *
E: then
C: AUDREY *
D: What? We’re not doing that. There * are a billion people in China, the odds are basically zero.
C: LOLO
D: The odds aren’t zero. You have a * picture now and the name of the * adoption agency, it’ll be so easy. * You could be like these people! * Lolo taps on her phone, showing youtube videos of adult Asian * adoptees reuniting with relatives in their home countries.
C: LOLO
D: Look how emotional, this chick’s * mascara is crying right off-- *
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY *
D: That’s them, not me. My parents are * my parents, I don’t need any other * ones. Besides, we’re going to be * too busy. Karen has a whole * itinerary set up for us already. *
C: LOLO *
D: Ugh. Karen. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Come on. She was my college best * friend! *
C: LOLO *
D: Yeah, the college version of me. * Lolo two point worse. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Well you only met her once, you’ll * like her once you get to know her. * It’s gonna be so much fun! You, me, * and-- *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Greetings. * Audrey recoils to see DEADEYE, 28, who’s appeared next to her. Wearing an “It’s an Honor Just to be Asian” shirt, a fanny pack and lots of eye-liner, she’s specific AF. With her flat voice and blank stare, Deadeye is an apt name.
E: O.S.
C: LOLO
D: Deadeye, you made it! Audrey, you remember my cousin? Audrey does, it’s not a good memory. Deadeye, who doesn’t blink or smile, stares at Audrey, who looks uncomfortable.
E: lights up
C: AUDREY
D: Yeah, you visited when we were twelve. I remember you used to * snort Fun Dip. *
C: DEADEYE
D: Still do. My favorite flavor is * green. * She matter-of-factly takes out some Fun Dip and snorts it. *
C: AUDREY
D: So, uh, what are you doing here?
C: DEADEYE *
D: Lolo said you guys were going to be * in Beijing and I was planning to * visit Nai Nai anyway, so I decided * to come with. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Okaaay. Could you give us a second? * Audrey pulls Lolo aside:
C: AUDREY
D: What the hell? You told Deadeye * about our trip? *
E: CONT'D
C: LOLO *
D: * Yeah, her parents asked my parents * if she could come with. I wasn’t sure she was even gonna show! Look, she doesn’t have a lot of friends-- ANGLE ON Deadeye, talking to a random child.
E: apologetic
C: DEADEYE
D: Greetings. The child’s parent grabs the kid away from Deadeye.
C: LOLO
D: --Any friends. * C’mon, she’s family, it’s fine! * Audrey sighs, doesn’t love it, but concedes. They head back to Deadeye.
E: then
C: LOLO
D: This is gonna be awesome! Epic trip, the three amigas! Squid squad! There’s a lotta dried squid in China. Deadeye pulls something out of her fanny pack.
E: CONT'D to Deadeye and Audrey to Audrey
C: DEADEYE
D: Would anyone like a glow stick for the flight.
C: AUDREY
D: Why?
C: DEADEYE
D: Just to hold and enjoy.
C: LOLO
D: Yeah, sure! Lolo and Deadeye cheerfully break their glow sticks which light up. Audrey has no idea how to react. Lolo checks Deadeye’s boarding pass.
E: makes sense to her
C: LOLO
D: Cool, you guys are sitting next to each other! C’mon, we’re boarding! OFF Audrey, this trip isn’t off to a great start. *

C: AUDREY

C: LOLO

C: LOLO *
D: What is wrong with you, those are * Koreans. *

D: Right? Let’s get a picture! * Karen takes a group selfie, checks it. Sees Deadeye’s face. *
E: then
C: KAREN
D: Not everyone is smiling, redo! Nevermind. Ooh, Clarence is here, * he just texted! *
E: CONT'D sees Deadeye’s look
C: DEADEYE *
D: Who’s Clarence. *
C: KAREN *
D: My fiance. *
C: LOLO *
D: * Dork name. *
E: aside to Deadeye
C: KAREN *
D: There he is! * Karen waves at CLARENCE, 30, who is wending his way towards * them. The crowd looks like it’s almost magically...parting for * him? Because HOLY SHIT: this dude is the hottest piece of ass * in the Middle Kingdom . He’s so good- * looking, it’s distracting. *
E: think Harry Shum, Jr.
C: LOLO *
D: * Why does she get to fuck this guy? * This is so unfair. * Clarence arrives at their booth and Karen slips her hand into * his. He raises it to his lips and kisses it, looking lovingly * at Karen the whole time. Lolo can’t believe this shit. *
E: low, to Audrey
C: AUDREY *
D: So! Tell us about the TV show you’re on. *
E: to Karen MORE
C: AUDREY
D: * Karen’s a big time actress now! *
E: CONT'D to others
C: KAREN
D: Oh, stop, you’re too kind. But yes, * it’s called Unit 8, I play Chunhwa, * the good girl. I was the good girl on my last two dramas, too. It’s kind of my brand.
C: CLARENCE
D: It’s what drew me to her. She’s as pure and beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside. Audrey reacts surprised, pure? Clarence and Karen nuzzle. Lolo, still thirsting after Clarence, pours herself an entire * glass of vodka, then sees Karen looking at her, judgy. *
C: LOLO
D: Did you want some?
C: KAREN
D: Oh, we don’t drink.
C: CLARENCE
D: We just get high on Jesus.
C: LOLO HAHAHAHA!
D: Oh, you’re not joking...
E: off Karen and Clarence
C: KAREN
D: Why would we joke about that? Audrey, that was one of the first things I told you when we met, remember? That I was a good, Christian girl saving myself for marriage?
E: hurriedly
C: AUDREY
D: Did you...?
E: confused
C: LOLO
D: So you guys have never had sex--
C: KAREN
D: Our connection is based on spiritual, not physical intimacy.
E: quickly
C: LOLO
D: Did you have a spiritual connection with Andy Roddick’s taint?
N: Karen glares at Lolo, but it all goes over Clarence’s head.
C: CLARENCE
D: You girls are so funny. I love when old friends get together, they always have inside jokes no one else would get.
C: KAREN
D: Darling, maybe you should get some air. * If he gets too close to alcohol his skin gets itchy.
E: to girls, re: Lolo’s drink
C: CLARENCE
D: My dewdrop. Always thinking of me. I am a little itchy, actually. He gets up and takes off his sweater, his T-shirt riding up to show a perfect six-pack. Lolo’s mouth falls open. Clarence pecks Karen on the cheek and exits. Lolo turns to Karen:
C: LOLO
D: How are you not fucking that?!
C: KAREN
D: You’re being vulgar. Also it’s none of your business.
C: LOLO You’re right, I apologize.
D: So has Clarence ever seen your pussy tat? Audrey chokes on her drink. Deadeye calmly eats a dumpling. *
E: beat
C: KAREN
D: It’s gone. Lasers can work miracles. Lasers and prayer. Gone.
C: LOLO
D: Prove it.
C: KAREN
D: Yolo Lolo. I used to be a bit of a * mess like you... but I grew out of * it. This stings Lolo, but she quickly recovers.
E: cold smile
C: LOLO
D: Are you sure, because some strains of HPV never leave the immune sys--
N: Audrey jumps in. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Hey, does anyone wanna dance? Let’s * go! *
C: KAREN *
D: I would love to, but first-- * * I have a very important question * for my best friend Audrey. * * Would you be my maid of honor? *
E: pointedly to Lolo to Audrey
C: AUDREY *
D: Ohmygod, YES! Of course! * Hugs. Squeals. Lolo stares at them, sullen. *
C: KAREN *
D: Wait, wait, that’s not all-- * * Guess where I’m going to be next * summer. Chicago! *
E: dramatic pause
C: AUDREY *
D: What? *
C: LOLO * WHAT. * KAREN *
D: * I got a part in a movie that’s * shooting there! Top secret, so I * can’t say anything but isn’t it * exciting!!! * More hugs. More squeals. *
E: giddy
C: AUDREY *
D: Oh my god that’s AMAZING! * Congratulations! And we finally get * to hang out again?! *
C: KAREN * REUNITED! * AUDREY *
D: I’m so happy for you! *
C: KAREN *
D: I’m happy for us! * Audrey’s delighted. Karen’s delighted. Lolo’s shocked and * rapidly getting to enraged-- this is a NIGHTMARE scenario for * her-- which makes Karen even more delighted. *
C: KAREN *
D: I can’t wait to see your new place, * Miss Homeowner! *
E: CONT'D
C: LOLO *
D: * Wait, your new place... you bought * it? *
E: to Audrey
C: AUDREY *
D: * Oh yeah, it’s no big deal, it’s * just a condo. *
E: slightly awkward
C: LOLO *
D: Why didn’t you tell me? *
C: AUDREY *
D: I just, uh... you know... * It’s clear why Audrey didn’t tell Lolo: she didn’t want her * broke-ass friend to feel bad/less successful. *
C: KAREN *
D: Who knows, maybe if I like Chicago * I’ll end up staying there for good! * Karen is really sticking it to Lolo now. She turns to Audrey. *
C: KAREN *
D: Now let’s go dance! To celebrate! * Remember this song?! * “OMG” by Usher is playing.
E: CONT'D re: music
C: AUDREY *
D: Winter formal! * Karen grabs Audrey’s hand and leads her to the dance floor, * leaving Lolo and Deadeye at the booth. *
C: LOLO *
D: * What even films in Chicago?? *
E: snippy
C: DEADEYE *
D: Chicago Hope. Chicago Fire. Chicago *
C: Med. Chicago PD. * LOLO *
D: Shut up. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: The Chi. *
C: LOLO *
D: Stop! *
C: DEADEYE *
D: * I like this song. * Deadeye stands up in her seat and begins a weird dance with * her arms in front of her like a cat. OFF Lolo, angrily looking * at Karen and Audrey having a great time on the dance floor. *
E: getting up
S: INT./EXT. BEIJING - VARIOUS
N: We see a MINI-MONTAGE of the girls enjoying Beijing: TEMPLE: Audrey and Karen, arm-in-arm, walk the peaceful * grounds as Lolo takes photos of the temple and garden. * Deadeye, lagging behind everyone, has earbuds in and is *
C: listening to BTS. *
D: MUSEUM: Audrey and Karen walk up to the ticket booth as Lolo * scrounges in her bag for cash. Deadeye, earbuds in, listening * to Girls’ Generation, ends up buying her ticket for her. * HIGH-END BOUTIQUE: Audrey and Karen happily shop for bags. Lolo checks a price tag and recoils. She sullenly goes to sit * down next to Deadeye, who is listening to After School. * KAREN’S HOUSE: Lolo lies around, bored, as Audrey works on her * laptop. Karen enters and surprises Audrey with a gift-- she’s * bought her one of the bags! Deadeye has earbuds in and is listening to Blackpink. Off Lolo, feeling left out...
S: EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK - DAY
N: Lolo leads the group as they walk through a painfully generic * industrial park. Audrey and Karen look around, unsure what they’re doing there.
C: LOLO
D: Just down this way! Audrey looks at Deadeye, who’s still got her earbuds in.
C: AUDREY
D: What are you listening to?
C: DEADEYE
D: BTS. I’m proud ARMY. I would let RM * and Suga spitroast me while * Jungkook filmed it with one hand * and jerked off Jimin with the * other. No disrespect to the other * three. * On Audrey, okay then. She calls to Lolo. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Uhh... So where are we going?
C: LOLO
D: Listen, we’ve been doing Karen’s itinerary this whole time. And it’s been great-- I stole two robes from the Mandarin hotel spa. But you should also see the real Beijing, ya know? Get back to your roots. *
C: KAREN *
D: We’re in a business park.
E: looking around, unimpressed
C: LOLO
D: Here it is! Lolo turns the corner, gestures to a sign on one of the offices: “Gladwell Adoption Services.”
C: AUDREY
D: What? Deadeye, seeing the sign, finally takes out her earbuds.
C: DEADEYE
D: Interesting.
C: LOLO
D: This is the agency that handled your adoption. So you can finally find your birth mom!
C: AUDREY
D: Wow. This is a lot--
E: thrown
C: KAREN
D: It’s too much.
C: LOLO
D: Oh, so sorry that I planned a cool surprise instead of another museum tour with a docent. * Come on, I made an appointment and everything!
E: to Audrey
C: AUDREY
D: Our schedule’s pretty packed already...
C: LOLO
D: Remember in fourth grade when we * had to draw family trees and you put Mary and Joe, but you also left a branch open for your birth mom? I know you think about her.
C: AUDREY
D: Thinking about her doesn’t mean I was trying to find her...
C: LOLO
D: Yeah, but we’re here! You’re back in China for the first time since you were a baby. Aren’t you curious? Like, where is she now? What does she do? What’s her name, even? * Lolo holds up her phone, showing the picture of Audrey’s birth mom. Audrey finally sighs, relenting to Lolo’s enthusiasm. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Okay, I guess it can’t hurt. They’ll either know or they won’t, right? And then we can move on.
C: LOLO
D: Right! As they head in...
C: KAREN
D: Just a reminder, we have the oxygen * bar at six. * Lolo sighs, shakes her head; Karen is so lame.
S: INT. GLADWELL ADOPTION SERVICES - OFFICE - LATER *
N: Audrey and the gang sit across from a PERKY ADOPTION AGENT (40s, American, think Michelle Buteau). There are multiple * portraits on display of happy American couples with their * Chinese babies. *
C: PERKY AGENT
D: ...on top of providing adoption services, we also reunite adoptees with their birth parents every day! We are honored to be part of your journey of discovery.
E: warm, reassuring
C: LOLO
D: Hear that? A journey of discovery. *
C: PERKY AGENT *
D: I just need your passport to *
C: confirm your ID. LOLO
D: Sure! Lolo hands Audrey’s passport to the Agent, who takes it, types it into her computer.
C: LOLO
D: I took it out of your travel bag * this morning. *
E: CONT'D off Audrey’s look
C: KAREN
D: That’s a huge violation of privacy.
C: LOLO *
D: K calm down, Karen. Audrey and I * are pretty much family, she’s fine. *
C: PERKY AGENT *
D: * Audrey Han Sullivan. I’m just going * to notify the U.S. Embassy of your * visit, it’s standard procedure... *
E: typing, off passport
C: AUDREY *
D: Is that really necessary? *
C: PERKY AGENT *
D: It’s just a formality. The Embassy * requests a log of all returning * adoptees. * Audrey looks a bit uneasy. As the Perky Agent types: *
C: LOLO *
D: * So, Tina. What brought you to * Beijing? Chinese husband? *
E: to Perky Agent, off * nametag
C: DEADEYE *
D: Chinese wife? *
C: LOLO *
D: Or are you like secretly a quarter * Chinese? *
C: KAREN *
D: I apologize for my nosy friends-- *
C: LOLO *
D: Ya know, I’m starting to see it * around the ears. You got a lowkey * Asian grandpa or something? *
C: PERKY AGENT *
D: Uhp, I found your file Audrey! Your * adoption happened before everything * was digitized, so I don’t have much * information here. But I have your * file number and whether your birth * mother agreed to be contacted. Good * news! She agreed! * At this, Audrey looks surprised but also a bit intrigued -- * this is the first moment that sparks a genuine interest in her * birth mother. *
C: LOLO *
D: Oh shit! Your mom wanted to meet a * bitch! *
C: PERKY AGENT *
D: I can go into the archives and pull * the full file, if you’d like. * The Perky Agent looks to Audrey. Everyone else looks to her * too, waiting as Audrey considers. Finally: *
C: AUDREY *
D: Okay. Yes. Sure. *
C: PERKY AGENT *
D: I’ll be right back! * The Perky Agent exits. *
C: LOLO *
D: FUCK YEAH BABY, WE’RE ABOUT TO FIND * MOMMALA! THIS IS EPICCCC-- * SMASH TO: *
S: INT. GLADWELL ADOPTION SERVICES - OFFICE - LATER *
N: A couple hours later. The girls are getting antsy. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Why’s this taking so long?
C: KAREN *
D: I guess I’ll call and cancel the * oxygen bar... Thanks Lolo. * The Perky Agent enters with a folder, followed by a stern- * looking, humorless U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIAL . *
E: think Jon Hamm
C: PERKY AGENT
D: Okay, so sorry to keep you waiting! * This is Agent Lindstrom, from the * U.S. Embassy. *
C: LOLO *
D: You are distractingly hot, are you * aware of that? *
C: EMBASSY OFFICIAL *
D: * Thank you, that’s very kind of you. *
E: subtitled, perfect Mandarin
C: LOLO *
D: * Okay, white guy who speaks Chinese? * I am full WAP right now. *
E: surprised and impressed
C: PERKY AGENT
D: I’ve asked him here because we found a little something funky in your file.
C: AUDREY *
D: Is something wrong? *
C: PERKY AGENT *
D: I wouldn’t say something’s wrong, * it’s just interesting! When I * retrieved your file, it turns out * that your adoption papers were * unsigned. *
C: AUDREY *
D: So... *
C: EMBASSY OFFICIAL *
D: Without a signature from a birth * parent, according to Hague * Convention laws enacted in 1995, * the year you were born, the * adoption is technically void. And * by extension, so is your birth * certificate, social security * number, and passport. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Excuse me? *
C: KAREN *
D: I knew this was a bad idea! *
C: LOLO *
D: Wait, IIII know what’s going on * here. This is some kinda scam, * right? Tina, are you trying to make * us pay some bribe to your fake hot * Embassy Official? * Lolo takes out her burner phone, starts filming the scene. *
C: LOLO *
D: * “Wassup you guys, I’m here on Insta * Live, about to uncover a scam!” * The Embassy Official sighs, annoyed. *
E: CONT'D into phone
C: EMBASSY OFFICIAL *
D: For the record, the U.S. Embassy is * not asking for a bribe. But in * accordance with Hague Convention * rules, Ms. Sullivan’s adoption * papers needs to be legally signed * by a birth parent. *
C: PERKY AGENT *
D: If you hadn’t come in here and had * us pull the file, we wouldn’t have * known this was an issue! *
C: LOLO *
D: Are you guys serious? Is this one * of those wack hidden camera shows? * Lolo gives Deadeye her phone to continue filming, then she * starts pacing around, opening drawers, cabinets, etc. *
C: LOLO *
D: Where are you Ashton Kootcher?! * Audrey’s trying to remain calm. *
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY *
D: I’m sorry. How do we fix this? *
C: PERKY AGENT *
D: It’s not a big deal, really! You * just need to track down your birth * mother and get her to sign the * adoption papers. We have all the * information here. *
C: KAREN *
D: But what if we can’t find her? *
C: EMBASSY OFFICIAL *
D: If you don’t get the signature, * Audrey’s adoption case will be put * under review. There’s a backlog of * cases, so it may take up to six * months. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Six months?! *
C: EMBASSY OFFICIAL *
D: I wish I could expedite, but I * wouldn’t want to be accused of any * impropriety given that we are ‘live * on Instagram’. *
C: LOLO *
D: Are you wearing a wire? I’m gonna * need you to take off your shirt. *
C: EMBASSY OFFICIAL *
D: * Again, for the record, everything * I’m doing is standard procedure. * This woman is sexually harassing * me. *
E: to phone
C: LOLO *
D: I’m not sexually harassing you, I * am merely trying to confirm... IF * YOU’RE A FAKE AGENT OR NOT! * Lolo darts forward and grabs the Embassy Official’s badge and * shows it to Deadeye, who is still filming. *
C: LOLO *
D: Look at this, this is clearly * photoshopped, nobody hot is named * Gary, this is obviously fake-- * The Embassy Official snatches his badge back. *
E: CONT'D
C: EMBASSY OFFICIAL *
D: I’m named after my father. In the * meantime, we will be keeping Ms. * Sullivan’s passport at the Embassy. * Until your case is resolved, you * can’t leave China. *
C: AUDREY *
D: But I’m spearheading a major client * pitch, I have to be back in Chicago * in a week! *
C: EMBASSY OFFICIAL *
D: You’ll be fine as long as you get * the signature by Friday. We close * at 5pm. *
C: PERKY AGENT *
D: Welp, we promised you a journey, * right ladies? Here’s the file! Good * luck! * The Perky Agent hands Audrey the file. The girls look * dumbfounded as they walk out: wtf just happened? *
S: EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK ALLEYWAY - MOMENTS LATER *
N: As soon as they’re out of sight of the agency doors, Audrey * smacks Lolo. *
C: LOLO *
D: Okay that didn’t go as planned-- *
C: AUDREY *
D: They took my passport because of * you! What am I supposed to do, I * have to be at work next week and I * can’t leave the country! * Lolo takes the file out of her hands and flips through it. *
C: LOLO *
D: Just chill out! All we need to do * is track down your birth mom and * get her to sign the papers. *
C: KAREN *
D: Yes, in three days. *
C: LOLO *
D: So we work fast. There’s an address * and a phone number-- * Deadeye looks at the file and dials the number... *
C: DEADEYE *
D: The phone number doesn’t work. *
C: KAREN *
D: Let me try. * She dials as Deadeye studies the file. *
C: KAREN *
D: * It’s an old number, it’s not * surprising... *
E: CONT'D hanging up
C: DEADEYE *
D: * Your mom is listed as Wu Ming Shi. * “Nameless person.” *
E: studying file
C: KAREN *
D: * It translates more as “Jane Doe”. * That’s not going to help. But we do * have an address in Xitang. Where is * that? *
E: off Audrey’s look, * softening it
C: DEADEYE *
D: * An hour outside Shanghai. * * Near Nai-Nai’s. *
E: googling to Lolo
C: LOLO *
D: Great, let’s go! We’ll take the * train, easy-peasy. *
C: KAREN *
D: Audrey, I can tell you’re * traumatized. Let’s just take a * black car. I have a service I use, * it’ll be simpler. And frankly, I * prefer to avoid public * transportation when I can. I get * recognized a fair amount. *
C: LOLO *
D: You’re not famous, Karen. *
C: KAREN *
D: * Maybe not in America. We’ll see * once I get to Chicago. But here... * Karen ever so subtly tips her head towards a few people down * the street; they’re pretending to take a photo, but it’s * clearly to get Karen in the background. *
E: pleasantly
C: LOLO *
D: I’ll believe you when I see that * happen forty more times today. *
C: AUDREY *
D: * If the car has wifi-- *
E: thinking
C: KAREN *
D: It does! *
C: AUDREY *
D: --then let’s take the car. I have * an important Zoom call tomorrow and * I don’t want any distractions. *
C: KAREN *
D: Great! I’ll set it up. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Thanks! * * Let’s just get this done. * Karen puts an arm around Audrey and they begin to walk away as * Lolo looks on, scowling. As they pass the giggling fans who * were taking a stealth pic of Karen: *
E: pulling herself together
C: LOLO *
D: * She’s a huge bitch, FYI. * The fans eyes’ widen, horrified that someone insulted their * idol, and raise their phones to film Lolo, who flips them off * as she walks away. *
E: subtitled in Mandarin
S: EXT. KAREN’S TOWNHOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY (NEXT MORNING) *
N: Audrey, Lolo, and Deadeye are putting overnight bags into a * black Escalade with the help of the driver, ARTHUR (think * Jimmy O. Yang). Clarence and Karen emerge; Clarence is holding * a GIANT fucking Louis Vuitton suitcase. *
C: LOLO *
D: What the FUCK, this is a two-day * trip. *
C: KAREN *
D: I have to look my best at all * times. None of my fans want to see * Chunhwa with a hair out of place or * anything less than perfect makeup, * much less repeating outfits. *
C: LOLO *
D: We’re going to a village in the * middle of nowhere, I’m sure it’s * fine if Chunhwa looks raggedy. * Clarence faces Karen to say goodbye. *
C: CLARENCE *
D: Goodbye, my dewdrop. Have an * amazing trip. *
C: KAREN *
D: I’ll miss you. *
C: CLARENCE *
D: I’ll miss you too, but I’ll be * tracking your every move. * He holds up his phone-- he and Karen have each other’s * locations on. *
C: LOLO *
D: * Ugh, of course they’re one of those * couples that have location sharing * on. *
E: to Audrey
C: CLARENCE *
D: And if you need me, just send me * our bat signal and I’ll be there. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Bat signal? *
C: KAREN *
D: It’s for emergencies. Like if * something happens and I need * Clarence to come right away, I send * him a bat emoji. It’s cute. *
C: LOLO *
D: Celibate and smothering, worst of * both worlds. *
C: CLARENCE *
D: * I’ll check in every hour on the * hour, of course. *
E: to Karen
C: KAREN *
D: Of course. * * And I’ll be thinking about you in * between. * She glances over at Lolo; she’s playing it just the slightest * bit sultry, on purpose. Lolo rolls her eyes, Karen leans in to * give Clarence a kiss...and he beats her to it, pecking her * ever so lightly on the lips. *
E: leaning in
C: CLARENCE *
D: I love you. Have fun! * He exits. A beat, the Lolo laughs. *
C: LOLO *
D: Wow. Denied. *
C: KAREN *
D: * I don’t know what you’re talking * about. *
E: stiffly
C: LOLO *
D: You were going for an actual smooch * there, like maybe even slip him * some tongue, and Saint Clarence was * like NOPE. He blueballed you. Your * balls are aching. *
C: KAREN *
D: * If you’re ever actually in a * genuine, adult relationship, you’ll * realize how trashy and unnecessary * that sounds. *
E: icy smile
C: LOLO *
D: * How long’s it been since you’ve * seen a dick? Look at this one! * Karen ignores her as she gets in the car. Lolo shrugs and * shows the pic to Deadeye instead. *
E: holding phone out to her
C: DEADEYE *
D: * Why is it hole-first. *
E: looking
C: LOLO *
D: I dunno, people try things. I’ll * take a bold choice, even if it’s a * bad choice. *

D: Thanks for setting up the car, * Karen! *
E: CONT'D
C: KAREN *
D: Of course. I’ll have car service in * Chicago too, so get used to this * kind of luxury when we’re hanging * out ALL THE TIME! * Lolo’s eyes narrow. Deadeye puts in her headphones. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Let me know if my music is too * loud. * Deadeye closes her eyes. The music is pounding out of her * headphones. *
C: KAREN *
D: Is that-- how does she sleep * through that? * Everyone shrugs. Arthur turns back to Karen. *
C: ARTHUR *
D: Miss Karen, I am a big fan of your * show. I never miss an episode. *

E: MORE
C: LOLO
D: It’s just such a coincidence that * the driver is a huge fan of hers. *

D: * Lay off. It’s nice that she has * fans. * In the front of the car, Arthur is still excitedly fanboying * to Karen about the show. *
E: absentmindedly, still * focused on her laptop
C: ARTHUR *
D: ...Chunhwa should not be with Rocky * anyway. You went to medical school, * you could have been a doctor. Qiang * was a better choice! *
C: KAREN *
D: Wow, Qiang was from Season 1! You * really know the show! *
C: ARTHUR *
D: It’s my favorite. In fact... * Arthur lifts up a sleeve to reveal that he has a tattoo of her * character Chunhwa’s face on his wrist. *
C: ARTHUR *
D: I am such a big fan, I got a * “Chunhwa” tattoo. * In the backseat, the others register this: WTF? Karen pats * Arthur on the hand. *
E: CONT'D

D: Now I am never washing this hand! * Thank you, Chunhwa! *

Audrey is finally taking a * break from her laptop and work files. Lolo is drooling, her * phone propped up, mid-text. In the passenger seat, Karen is * also asleep, but as the camera gets closer, she senses * something in front of her face. * She opens her eyes to see Arthur STARING OVER HER. *

D: You have amnesia! I will make you * remember, Qiang is your one true * love! *
C: KAREN *
D: What?! * By now the other girls are wide awake. *
C: AUDREY *
D: What’s going on? *
C: KAREN *
D: Arthur, I’m going to need you to * pull over. *
C: ARTHUR *
D: No, Qiang must get Chunhwa back * from Rocky! *
C: LOLO *
D: Who the fuck is Qiang?! *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Qiang is Chunhwa’s ex-boyfriend who * she left for Rocky. He went crazy * and killed himself in a car * accident at the end of Season 1. *
C: LOLO * Ummmm. ‘SCUSE ME? * KAREN *
D: Aw Deadeye, I didn’t know you * watched Unit 8? *
C: AUDREY *
D: He killed himself in a car * accident?! We’re in a car right * now! * Arthur starts ranting, driving errantically. *
C: ARTHUR *
D: You’re making a big mistake! Qiang * and Chunhwa must be together! This * is why I took the drivers’ service * exam, to make this happen! *
C: KAREN *
D: Arthur, please, just pull over-- *
C: ARTHUR *
D: * Chunhwa and Qiang forever. There is * only one true love! *
E: deranged
C: AUDREY *
D: Oh my god he’s going to kill us * all! *
C: LOLO * DO SOMETHING! *
D: As Arthur continues babbling nonsense and driving dangerously, * Karen lunges for the wheel. A scuffle ensues as everyone * shouts. *
C: ARTHUR KAREN
D: Chunhwa, don’t do this! Just stop, please! *
N: Finally Deadeye THWACKS Arthur on the head with Karen’s * handbag, one SWIFT, HARD HIT. He’s instantly out, falling * forward, unconscious, onto the wheel as the car spins out of * control. As everyone screams, Karen finally is able to * scramble partway over to grab the wheel and stick a foot on * the brake, but she can only slow the car down a little before * it crashes into the guardrail. *
S: EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - LATER *
N: The girls exit the smoking car. Arthur is unconscious and * bleeding, slumped over the wheel. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Ohmygod ohmygod. What do we do * now?! *
C: LOLO *
D: Let’s not panic, okay?--aaaaah, * fuck! That’s a whole lotta blood. *
C: AUDREY *
D: We need to call the police! * Karen holds up her phone. *
C: KAREN *
D: I don’t have any service, we’re in * the middle of nowhere. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: I don’t have service either. And * the wifi is out too. *
C: LOLO *
D: Well well well. Look who’s coming * to the rescue. * Lolo holds up her janky phone. *
C: KAREN *
D: You have service? *
C: LOLO *
D: Yeah, four bars. I can’t make * calls, but I’ll DM my grandparents * to come pick us up. Fuck it, I’ll * just DM Stephon Marbury too, might * as well keep it going. *
C: KAREN *
D: Can you DM Clarence? He’s going to * be so worried. *
C: LOLO *
D: Sure, what’s his handle, * @drydickthreeinches? *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Um, you guys. * Deadeye points to Arthur who stirs and opens his eyes. *
C: ARTHUR *
D: * The girls react, panicky, but then he drops his head and * passes out again. *
E: screams
C: LOLO *
D: We need to get the fuck away. *
C: AUDREY *
D: But he’s hurt. *
C: KAREN *
D: I hate to agree with Lolo but I do * not want to be stuck in the middle * of nowhere with this psycho when he * wakes up. * Arthur stirs again, this time with a groan. The girls look to * each other and start rapidly walking away. *
S: EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - LATER *
N: Hours later. The girls, hot and cranky, looking bedraggled, * haul their stuff down the road. Audrey looks around at the * desolate scene as she listlessly holds up a hitchhiking hand. *
C: AUDREY *
D: How has it been hours and we * haven’t seen one car? *
C: LOLO *
D: Maybe it’s because everyone’s * taking the train... * Lolo glares accusingly at Karen, who looks too weak to fight. *
C: KAREN *
D: Do we have any water? I need water. * Audrey turns to Lolo. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Have your grandparents responded * yet? *
C: LOLO *
D: No, not yet. They’re probably * napping, they nap a lot. I hope * they respond soon though, my * battery’s at like, 7%. * Karen dabs her face. *
C: KAREN *
D: At this point I don’t even want to * be rescued. I can’t be seen in * public looking like this. *
C: LOLO *
D: Like what, a melted-contour paste * monster? * Lolo picks up her camera and snaps a picture of Karen. *
C: KAREN *
D: Stop! *
C: LOLO *
D: What, I’m just-- * * Oh shit my phone just died. *
E: noticing
C: AUDREY *
D: What?! You were just at 7%! * * What are we going to do now?? *
E: off Lolo’s shrug
C: DEADEYE *
D: * There’s a sign up ahead. It says... * the next town is... 27 kilometers * away. *
E: squinting
C: AUDREY *
D: That’s going to take forever! * * That’s just great. My work call is * in ten minutes and we’re in the * middle of nowhere with no phones, * no food, no water... We are so * screwed. * Just then, they hear a vehicle coming towards them. They turn * and see headlights. A glimmer of hope! *
E: spiraling
C: KAREN *
D: There’s someone on the road! *
C: LOLO *
D: It’s a bus. Is there a bus stop on * this highway? * The girls wave at the bus, trying to flag it down. *
C: AUDREY *
D: It’s slowing! * As the bus gets closer, they can start to make out the logo on * the side... *
C: LOLO *
D: Wait, Beijing Royal Fighters... * * It’s him. * The bus stops. The doors open. STEPHON MARBURY appears, bathed * in light, gorgeous and god-like. *
E: gasps
C: STEPHON MARBURY *
D: Hello. *
C: LOLO *
D: Oh my god, Stephon Marbury. * The other girls look shocked -- it really is him. *
C: STEPHON MARBURY *
D: You must be Lolo. Do you still need * a ride? We’re on our way to * Shanghai for a game. *
C: LOLO *
D: Hell yeah we need a ride! *
C: STEPHON MARBURY *
D: The only thing is... our A/C is * out, so... *
S: INT. CBA BUS - CONTINUOUS *
N: REVEAL: a bus full of SMOKING HOT, SWEATY, SHIRTLESS * BASKETBALL PLAYERS. Lolo smiles wide. Audrey’s jaw drops. * Deadeye’s jaw drops. Even Karen can’t hide a hint of delight-- * this bus is heaven. *
C: KAREN *
D: * My goodness. * Lolo settles into a seat next to Stephon and plugs her phone * into an outlet. The bus is tricked out with leather seats, TV * screens, and even a skylight. *
E: breathless
C: LOLO *
D: The bus has wifi, Audrey, you can * do your Zoom call! *
C: AUDREY *
D: * Oh thank god! * * You really saved us. *
E: relieved to Stephon Marbury
C: STEPHON MARBURY *
D: Of course I did. When someone asks * me for help, I’m there. * Stephon Marbury looks intensely at Lolo. *
C: LOLO *
D: Come murder my pussy. * They start making out, hard. Audrey takes out her laptop to * set up her zoom call, then turns to Karen. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Can we call the cops about Arthur? * We just left him in the car and he * could have a concussion or * something. *
C: KAREN *
D: Frankly, an insane stalker who * tried to murder us all might * deserve a concussion. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Right, well, at least the cops can * get him help? It’s the right thing * to do. *
C: KAREN *
D: * I know, I know... *
E: sighs
C: VOICE *
D: Karen? Karen Huang? * TODD taps * Karen on the shoulder. *
E: O.S. 28, American, smoking hot and shirtless, of course
C: TODD *
D: Sup chica. Fancy seein’ you here. *
C: KAREN *
D: Uhhhh, I have no idea who you are. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Todd? From Northwestern? *
C: TODD *
D: Oh hey Audrey! Didn’t see ya there. *
C: AUDREY *
D: It’s so crazy running into you! * What are you doing in China? *
C: TODD *
D: Playing basketball professionally. * After college I didn’t want to slum * it in the G-League, so I came here. * Now I’m the captain of the Royal * Fighters. * Todd nods at Karen, who is trying to look away. *
C: TODD *
D: Why’s Karen pretending not to know * me? *
E: CONT'D
C: KAREN *
D: My name’s not Karen... *
C: TODD *
D: C’mon Huang. You don’t remember * that weekend after finals? We set a * record, 23 times in a day. * Lolo tears herself away from sucking face with Stephon Marbury * just in time to hear this. *
C: LOLO *
D: Oh shit, did you bang this dude? *
C: KAREN *
D: No! *
C: DEADEYE *
D: She did, she’s exhibiting every * telltale sign of lying. *
C: TODD *
D: * Do you still have the tattoo? *
E: to Karen
C: LOLO *
D: Wait, you’ve seen the pussy tat?! *
C: KAREN *
D: * Excuse me but I have a really * important call that Audrey needs me * to make, right Audrey? * * Hello? Is this the police? I’d like * to report an accident I saw... * Karen hurriedly moves away. ANGLE BACK ON Lolo and Marbury. *
E: panicky to phone, in Mandarin
C: LOLO *
D: So. Wanna bang? *
C: STEPHON MARBURY *
D: Oh hell yeah. But let me get to * know you a little first. *
C: LOLO *
D: Aw, you’re a romantic. Well I’m a * Capricorn with a Leo rising, I once * won $300 on Wheel of Fortune, and * I’m an artist. But it’s not like * I’m famous or anything. *
C: STEPHON MARBURY *
D: Fame doesn’t matter. What really * matters... is in here. * Stephon Marbury reaches over as if to point to her heart, but * then cups her full breast. She smiles, into it. *
C: STEPHON MARBURY *
D: Well now that we know each other, * I’m thinking maybe we start with a * little-- * * --and then some-- * *
E: CONT'D whispers whispers
C: LOLO *
D: * You can do that? *
E: eyes wide
C: STEPHON MARBURY *
D: Only one way to find out. * Lolo and Marbury take off towards the back of the bus. ANGLE * ON Audrey, headphones on, talking to Frank on her computer * screen. INTERCUT WITH: Frank at the office. *
C: FRANK *
D: Audrey! How’s China? *
E: ON ZOOM
C: AUDREY *
D: Great so far, thank you! It’s been * a really educational trip. *
C: FRANK *
D: Fantastic. I wanted to give you an * update. The WestStar pitch moved up * a day -- is that a problem? *
E: ON ZOOM
C: AUDREY *
D: Well my flight is supposed to get * in that morning-- *
E: ON PHONE
C: FRANK *
D: That’s not good. *
C: AUDREY *
D: No it’s fine, I can come straight * from the airport. I’ll be there! * ANGLE ON Karen, sitting in the back of the bus, finishing her * phone call. Deadeye comes by with a water, which Karen * gratefully takes. *
C: KAREN *
D: Thanks. * * Is Todd still looking? * Deadeye looks over at Todd. *
E: then, cautiously
C: DEADEYE *
D: No, he’s playing Switch. *
C: KAREN
D: You don’t judge me, right Deadeye? Because I’m different now. Now I have Clarence and a great relationship with Christ. But Karen can’t help looking around-- it’s like every single * bball player on the bus is moving in SLOW-MO, flexing biceps, * stretching, showing off their sinewy muscles... Karen makes a * squeaky, pained noise. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Are you audibly groaning from the * physical torture of years of pent- * up sexual frustration. *
C: KAREN *
D: * Shut up! * ANGLE BACK ON Audrey on her zoom. *
E: frantic
C: AUDREY *
D: Frank, I promise you, I got this. *
C: FRANK *
D: Just in case, we’ll have Beckett * prepped to take over for you. *
E: ON ZOOM
C: AUDREY *
D: * Beckett? He’s a second year. *
E: insulted
C: FRANK *
D: He’s really stepped up since you’ve * been gone. *
E: ON ZOOM
C: AUDREY *
D: I just left! Look, you don’t need * him. I’ll make it work. *
C: FRANK *
D: Audrey, I-- what’s going on in the * background there? * Behind Audrey, two of the shirtless basketball players are * horsing around, throwing a mini basketball. *
E: ON ZOOM
C: AUDREY *
D: Oh, uh, nothing-- * Suddenly, we hear a loud noise coming from outside the bus. *
C: FRANK *
D: What’s that? Are those sirens? * Yes they are-- SIRENS BLARE as a police car appears behind the * bus, pulling it over. *
N: Just then, one of the shirtless basketball players behind * Audrey pantses the other, revealing his BUTT right in the Zoom * frame. *
C: FRANK *
D: Is that a butt?! What is going on-- *
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY *
D: * I think the wifi on this bus is * about to go out I’ll have to catch * you later Frank! Thanks! * She shuts the zoom window. The police sirens continue as the * bus driver pulls over, opens his door, and begins talking in * Mandarin to a couple of POLICE OFFICERS who have approached * the door and are standing outside. Audrey turns to Karen and * Deadeye. *
E: frantic
C: AUDREY *
D: Is this about Arthur? *
E: CONT'D
C: KAREN *
D: Yes, the cops found him. * * Oh shit. * Karen and Deadeye share a look of concern as they listen in on * the conversation in Mandarin. *
E: listening
C: DEADEYE *
D: You never should’ve called the * police. *
C: KAREN *
D: I didn’t want to, but-- * Karen doesn’t want to say it’s Audrey’s fault. *
C: AUDREY *
D: What’s happening?? *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Apparently Arthur is the son of a * government official. He told the * cops the actress who plays Chunhwa * and three of her friends attacked * him and left him for dead. *
C: AUDREY *
D: What?! *
C: KAREN *
D: They want to bring us in for * questioning. *
C: AUDREY *
D: We can’t! We don’t have time, we * have to get to Xitang tonight! *
C: DEADEYE *
D: He’s coming on the bus. * ANGLE ON one of the police officers ascending the bus steps. * He’s a huge, scary-looking man with Khal Drogo vibes. The * girls all reflexively duck down. *
C: AUDREY *
D: We have to hide! * Audrey, Deadeye, and Karen run for the bathroom in the back-- *
S: INT. CBA BUS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS *
N: The girls rush into the tiny bathroom, which is occupied by... * Lolo, propped up high against the wall, legs wrapped around * Stephon Marbury’s face. *
C: LOLO *
D: AND 1! AND 1! AND 1! *
C: AUDREY *
D: Shhh! *
C: STEPHON MARBURY *
D: * The fuck? * As the girls cram on in, Karen can’t squeeze in. *
E: muffled
C: KAREN *
D: We’re not all gonna fit-- *
S: INT. CBA BUS - CONTINUOUS *
N: Karen is left outside as the bathroom door slams shut. As the * Police Officer steps onto the bus, Karen is going to be caught * until Todd suddenly grabs her and covers her with a blanket. * Karen is left with her face in Todd’s lap. The Police Officer * steps up, addresses the bus. *
C: POLICE OFFICER *
D: * Attention! The driver says four * girls came onto this bus. Where are * they now? * The Basketball Players all look at each other: what to say? * Todd pipes up. *
E: subtitled, in Mandarin
C: TODD *
D: They’re gone. They jumped out the * window about fifteen minutes ago. * The Police Officer slowly walks over, stares at Todd. *
C: POLICE OFFICER *
D: Four girls? Jumped out the window? *
C: TODD *
D: Yes, it was crazy. They couldn’t * stand the A/C being out I guess. *
C: POLICE OFFICER *
D: Why were they even on the bus? *
C: TODD *
D: They were guests of our coach, * Stephon Marbury. *
C: POLICE OFFICER *
D: Ah, Coach Marbury. Where is he now? *
C: TODD *
D: Umm... *
S: INT. CBA BUS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS *
N: Inside the bathroom, Lolo, Stephon Marbury, Audrey, and * Deadeye are all crammed against each other. They whisper. *
C: LOLO *
D: Shit. What are we gonna do? *
C: AUDREY *
D: Just be quiet, maybe he’ll leave! *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Is that your erection. *
C: STEPHON MARBURY *
D: Yeah. *
C: LOLO *
D: What if we Shawshanked our way out? * I’ll climb into this toilet right * now. *
C: STEPHON MARBURY *
D: Maybe we hijack the bus. Does * anyone have a weapon? *
C: LOLO *
D: * I know where there’s a weapon. *
E: intense
N: She reaches below frame, making heavy eye contact with him, * and they start making out furiously again. Audrey and Deadeye * both squirm, trying to avert their eyes. Audrey uncomfortably * looks towards the ceiling, only to see Lolo’s camera mounted * on the wall and pointing down at them. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Ew, you guys were filming? *
C: STEPHON MARBURY *
D: I love breaking down game tape. It * only makes me better. * Audrey, wheels turning, points to the camera... *
C: AUDREY *
D: I have an idea... *
S: INT. CBA BUS - CONTINUOUS *
N: The Police Officer is now having a conversation with Todd as * Karen tries hard not to move... which is difficult given that * she’s sweating under a blanket, in the lap of an ex-boyfriend. *
C: POLICE OFFICER *
D: ...I lost 200 yuan last game when * you missed that shot at the buzzer. * Next time maybe you pass to your * teammates who are open. *
C: TODD *
D: * I’ll do that, Officer. * The Police Officer smiles thinly, then looks around. *
E: getting annoyed
C: POLICE OFFICER *
D: If you see those four girls, please * tell them the Jiashan Police want * to bring them in for questioning. * The Officer turns to go. Under the blanket, Karen can’t hold * it in any longer. She SNEEZES. The Officer whips back around. *
C: POLICE OFFICER *
D: What was that? *
E: CONT'D
C: TODD *
D: That was... me. * The Officer looks down at the blanket. *
C: POLICE OFFICER *
D: Is your lap cold, captain? *
C: TODD *
D: Yes, I like to balance being * shirtless with a warm lower body. * It’s stifling under the blanket. Karen can’t help but fidget. *
C: POLICE OFFICER *
D: Captain, I think you’re hiding * someone under there. * The Police Officer reaches for the blanket...AND SUDDENLY, * FROM THE BATHROOM, Marbury steps out, in his tighty-whiteys, * his arms behind him. *
C: STEPHON MARBURY *
D: * Excuse me Officer, is there a * problem-- * And suddenly he whips Lolo’s camera out from behind his back * and snaps a picture, unleashing a BRIGHT FLASH which * temporarily blinds the officer. *
E: uber-polite
C: POLICE OFFICER *
D: Aaaa! * Marbury drops Lolo’s camera, then charges down the aisle, * grabbing the Officer’s cap as he rushes out the door. *
C: POLICE OFFICER *
D: * My hat! * The Officer runs after Marbury, allowing the girls to burst * out of the bathroom . * Lolo puts her camera around her neck, points at the skylight. *
E: CONT'D high-pitched and Karen to emerge from Todd’s lap
C: LOLO *
D: Let’s go! * Todd helps the girls as they start climbing out of the raised * skylight. As soon as they’re all up, Karen turns and kisses * Todd on the cheek. *
C: KAREN *
D: Thank you! *
S: EXT. CBA BUS / EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS *
N: The girls climb out of the skylight and onto the roof of the * bus. Freedom! In the background, Stephon Marbury runs down the * highway as the Officer chases. As the other Officer in the car * calls for backup, the girls climb down a ladder from the roof * of the bus and start running down a side road. *
S: EXT. VILLAGE ROAD - LATER *
N: The girls are in the clear. Karen looks around, realizes. *
C: KAREN *
D: Shit. My suitcase is still on that * bus-- Fuck. Fuckity fuck fuck FUCK! *
C: LOLO *
D: Wow. Do you kiss your fiance with * that mouth? Oh wait. *
C: KAREN *
D: Hahahaha, you’re SO funny Lolo, *
C: FUCK YOU! * LOLO *
D: Whoa. Are you mad about the * suitcase or because we’re no longer * on the bus with your super hot ex? *
C: KAREN *
D: Shut up! This is all your fault. I * welcomed you into my home, you and * your weird cousin-- *
C: LOLO DEADEYE
D: Don’t call Deadeye weird! Fair. *
C: KAREN *
D: And we should’ve been having high * tea at the Waldorf right now but * instead we’re here and it’s all * because of you! *
C: LOLO *
D: Hey. It’s not ALL my fault-- *
C: AUDREY *
D: I mean, it kinda is. *
C: LOLO *
D: You’re taking her side?? *
C: AUDREY *
D: I’m not taking anyone’s side, but * we are here because you made me go * to the adoption agency. If we’d * never done that... *
C: LOLO *
D: Wow. Well, I’m sorry I messed up * all of Karen’s dumb plans. *
C: KAREN *
D: It’s fine, Audrey and I can do all * my dumb plans next summer in * Chicago. *
C: LOLO *
D: Maybe I’ll move to Chicago too and * then me and Audrey will hang out * without you! *
C: KAREN *
D: Hmm, why do I have a feeling that * you’ll never leave your parents’ * house? *
C: LOLO *
D: You know what, fuck you, we’re * never hanging out again after this. *
C: KAREN *
D: That’s the best news I’ve heard all * day! * Karen and Lolo start shouting at each other as Audrey tries to * get in the middle. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Stop it! Stop fighting! * Finally, Deadeye whistles loudly, getting all their attention. * She holds up her phone. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Grandma called. They sent our * cousin Deng to come get us. He’s * already at the bridge in town. * Deadeye points into the village. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: It’s a five-minute walk from here. * Are you coming. * Deadeye looks to Audrey and Karen. Karen looks uncertain. *
E: CONT'D
C: KAREN *
D: I already sent Clarence the bat * signal, he’s on his way. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: But Deng is already here. * Deadeye shows Deng’s location nearby on her phone. Audrey * studies it, then: *
C: AUDREY *
D: Let’s just go with Deng. We’re so * close to Xitang, I’ll just get the * signature and get back. *
C: KAREN *
D: Fine. Just let me get my things, oh * that’s right, I have nothing now. *
N: Lolo can’t help but smile as Karen reluctantly follows. *
S: EXT. RURAL VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER *
N: The girls walk through an idyllic water town. Ancient * buildings and shops line the streets. *
C: AUDREY *
D: This is a cute little village. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: It’s an historic Chinese water * town. It runs completely off * hydroelectric power. *
C: LOLO *
D: We went to a water town once with * the family years ago. There are a * lot of them near Nai Nai’s. *
C: KAREN *
D: Oh look! There’s a wedding * happening right now! * Several people carrying a red, ornate bridal sedan chair march * past as onlookers gather to catch a glimpse of the bride in * her traditional red gown. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: * Xitang is also a water town. Your * mom probably grew up in a place * like this. * Audrey reacts at the mention of her “mom”... She looks around * at the charming and colorful town, at the Chinese families, at * a cute young mom and her daughter - she’s starting to warm to * the idea of connecting with her roots/mom... when a scary * SNORTING WATER BUFFALO snaps her out of it -- it’s one of many * being herded by a gruff man towards the river. *
E: to Audrey
C: GRUFF MAN *
D: * Be careful! *
E: in local dialect
C: AUDREY *
D: Sorry! Dui bu qi! *
C: KAREN *
D: They probably don’t speak Mandarin * here, just dialect. But you sounded * good there, the accent was good! * Deadeye gently directs the girls around the corner. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: The bridge is this way. I think * Deng’s just on the other side. * They turn the corner, only to see... *
S: EXT. BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER *
N: A flooded bridge. Muddy river water has completely wiped out * the road. Fuck. A faraway figure waves from the other side of * the river. It’s DENG. Deadeye looks up from her texts. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: That’s Deng. He can’t get across. * He says we have to wait until the * water recedes. *
C: AUDREY *
D: How long is that going to take?! *
C: DEADEYE *
D: I don’t know. At least several * hours. Maybe a day or two. *
C: AUDREY *
D: We don’t have that kind of time! * Audrey looks to the river, then back at the shore, where there * is a boathouse nearby. She points to several dragonboats * outside. *
C: AUDREY *
D: What are those? *
E: CONT'D
C: DEADEYE *
D: Dragonboats. The Dragonboat * Festival is coming up soon, it’s a * national holiday. * Audrey looks back at the river, wheels turning. *
C: AUDREY *
D: It can’t be more than a thousand * meters across... The water is very * calm, super flat conditions, no * wind... What if we rowed across? *
C: KAREN *
D: You’re not serious. *
C: AUDREY *
D: * I rowed crew in college. Well, I * mean, I was the coxswain, but * still. It’s not far at all, we can * take these sculls-- *
E: getting excited
C: DEADEYE *
D: They’re dragonboats. *
C: AUDREY *
D: --And row them across, easy! It’s * basically a dash, it’ll take like * five minutes max. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: I’m down. I set a record on the row * machine at the Alhambra LA Fitness. *
C: LOLO *
D: Okayyyy. Why not, let’s fucking GO! *
C: KAREN *
D: Can’t we just wait? I mean, * Clarence might be here soon. Or * maybe they can drain the bridge... *
C: LOLO *
D: Ugh, what is it, you don’t want to * get sweaty and ruin your makeup? *
C: KAREN *
D: No, it’s not that-- *
C: LOLO *
D: Oh, so you’re just a bad friend * then? Okay, cool! *
C: KAREN *
D: Shut. Up. It’s just-- I can’t swim, * okay?? * She looks genuinely fearful. *
C: AUDREY *
D: You’ll be fine, we’re not going to * be swimming, we’re going to be in a * boat. *
C: KAREN *
D: But what if something goes wrong? *
C: AUDREY *
D: Listen, I’ve spent like a thousand * hours on the water in crew and I’ve * never, ever had anyone catch a crab * and go overboard. Catch a crab, * crew term. *
C: LOLO *
D: * We’re going with Audrey. If you * want to wait for Clarence, then you * can stay here! *
E: pointedly
N: Karen hesitates, then looks to Audrey. *
C: KAREN *
D: You promise you won’t let me drown? *
C: AUDREY * I promise. * KAREN *
D: Alright... * The girls approach a boat. Audrey grabs the waterproof boat * bag and sticks her adoption file in it along with everyone’s * phones and her laptop; at the last second, Lolo manages to * cram her camera in there as well. Audrey starts barking * directions. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Okay. Hands on! That’s a crew term * for “grab it”. Now, let’s walk it * forward! * On the shore, they see a MAN emerge past the boathouse, waving * at them from afar. *
C: KAREN *
D: * Sorry, we don’t understand dialect! * We’re just renting the boat! * Karen waves some money and puts it into a collection box near * the boathouse. The girls push the boat onto the water as the * man continues yelling at them in local dialect, waving, * pointing at his watch, almost as if he’s warning them not to * get on the water right now... *
E: subtitled, in Mandarin
S: EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS *
N: The gang sets out across the river. Audrey is in the back, * shouting directions as they paddle. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Left! Right! Left! Right! Three, * you’re late! Good work, one! All * four, on the square, gimme a power * ten, now! * They’re doing really well, already midway across the river. As * they get there, Audrey shouts out a command. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Hold water! *
E: CONT'D
C: LOLO *
D: * What?! *
E: still paddling
C: AUDREY *
D: Stop! *
C: LOLO *
D: Then just say that! * Everyone stops paddling for a little break. Audrey looks out * onto the water. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Sorry, it’s just that I wanted to * look at the view. It’s beautiful * out here. * It really is. They all take a quiet beat to admire the * scenery, take it all in. And then...the boat starts moving. * Lolo looks around, confused. *
C: LOLO *
D: Wait, we’re not paddling. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: The water’s moving. *
C: KAREN *
D: What? What’s happening?! * The boat is now moving fast down the river as the water around * them churns. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: The dam must be on a timer. That’s * why no one was on the river, they * probably have some hydropower * release schedule. *
C: LOLO *
D: So where are we headed? *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Probably intake turbines? *
C: AUDREY *
D: Oh shit! Row backwards, let’s get * back to shore! * They all start paddling backwards, but the water is churning * too fast. *
C: KAREN *
D: * Oh my god we’re going to die!!! *
E: starting to cry
C: AUDREY *
D: Keep going, let me just see-- * Audrey stands up to quickly survey the situation. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Shit. We’re headed to a turbine, * but there’s a safe overflow to the * right! We just need to go right, * it’s gonna be okay-- AAA! * Audrey’s oar suddenly catches the water, breaking the blade * off completely. *
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY *
D: SHIT SHIT SHIT! I caught a crab. *
E: CONT'D
C: KAREN *
D: What the fuck does that mean?! *
C: AUDREY *
D: Just keep rowing right! * The boat is fast approaching the fork in the river, marked by * a buoy: in front of them is the dam intake/turbine situation, * to the right is the safe zone of river overflow. Karen starts * sobbing. *
C: KAREN *
D: I never wanted to get on the boat! *
C: LOLO *
D: Oh FUCK when you said turbines, *
C: it’s like...fuckin’ TURBINES! *
D: The turbines are now clearly in view as the water churns even * faster. Lolo and Deadeye frantically paddle on the left side, * trying to make the boat turn right, but they’re coming up on * the fork, fast. *
C: LOLO *
D: We’re not gonna make it! *
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY *
D: We are, we’re just gonna need to * abandon ship! *
C: KAREN * WHAT?! *
D: Audrey grabs Karen’s oar. *
C: AUDREY *
D: On the count of three, I need you * all to take your oars to the right, * jump, and hold on, okay?! Do you * hear me? On THREE! *
C: LOLO / DEADEYE *
D: Yes captain! / Yes. * Audrey wraps Karen’s arms around her as the boat barrels * towards the open dam turbines. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Karen, hold on to me, okay? * *
E: then shouting
C: ONE! TWO! * LOLO *
D: We’re so close! *
C: AUDREY *
D: *
E: beat
C: THREE! *
D: Audrey, Lolo and Deadeye stick their oars straight across * right as they get to the buoy, timing it just so that the oars * slingshot the girls into the safe overflow zone. The boat they * were on continues through, straight into the turbines, * splitting into thousands of pieces. *
C: LOLO *
D: FUUUUUCK THAT WAS SO METAL! *
C: AUDREY *
D: * Oh my god, my work computer, my * file!-- *
E: looking around, frantic
C: LOLO *
D: --my camera!-- *
C: DEADEYE * I got it. *
D: Deadeye holds up the waterproof boat bag as Audrey and Lolo * sigh in relief. The girls have now been safely washed past the * fork, downriver, but they’re still on the open water. And now * with no boat. The girls, treading water, struggle to keep * Karen afloat. Audrey points to the faraway shore. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Now we just need to swim. The * shore’s not far that far, it’s * maybe only like two hundred meters. *
C: KAREN *
D: I’m gonna drown! *
C: AUDREY *
D: You’re not gonna drown, we’ve got * you! * As the girls try to keep Karen from dipping underwater, she * begins hysterically sobbing. *
C: KAREN *
D: I’m gonna drown and the pictures * will be so ugly and Clarence is * gonna meet a girl at my * funerallllll. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Don’t freak out, we’re so close! * But Karen is weighing down Lolo and Deadeye who’s now on the * other side of her. *
C: LOLO *
D: * She’s dragging us down! Are you * sure we can’t just leave her? *
E: bobbing
C: AUDREY *
D: No! *
C: LOLO *
D: Kidding! * * But will you just stop struggling? * You’re making it worse-- *
E: to Karen
C: DEADEYE *
D: Uh oh. * HOLY FUCK. A whole herd of water buffalo is now swimming towards them. *
E: like the one we saw * before in town
C: LOLO *
D: Oh fuck! Water buffalo! *
C: AUDREY *
D: Come on! * The girls attempt to swim, but of course, the water buffalo * are quickly upon them. *
C: KAREN *
D: Oh my GOOOOOOOOOOD, don’t kill me, * I don’t even eat meat! * As the buffalo swarm around them, they’re really gonna die * now... Except not, because a passing water buffalo bumps into * Karen, accidentally scooping her onto its back, saving her! *
C: AUDREY *
D: Holy shit! Grab a buffalo! * The girls all grab a buffalo as they ride their way to shore! *
S: EXT. SHORE - CONTINUOUS *
N: As the girls reach the shore, they tumble off their buffalo * rides. They collapse onto the ground, clothes torn, relieved, * grateful to be alive. A beat, then Audrey starts laughing. * Then they all start laughing at the absurdity of what just * happened. *
C: LOLO *
D: So what’s the crew term for * buffalo? * Everyone laughs harder. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Hey, we made it at least! *
C: KAREN *
D: I really thought I was going to * drown. *
C: LOLO *
D: If you weren’t gonna drown I was * gonna kill you! *
C: KAREN *
D: Fair enough! * All tension from before has dissipated as the girls laugh it * off. Lolo looks down, notices that her pants and underwear are * torn. *
C: LOLO *
D: Oh shit, my ass is like completely * out! *
C: AUDREY *
D: Hell yeah girl, work it! * Lolo starts twerking on the ground as everyone hoots. Karen, * laughing, flips over onto her back. *
C: KAREN *
D: Oh my goodness, we need to get some * clothes, we’re basically all nude-- * ANGLE ON all of the girls staring at her, their faces shocked. * REVERSE ANGLE ON what they’re staring at: Karen’s HUGE PUSSY * TATTOO: a SCARY DEVIL that covers not only her vagina but a * large part of her entire pelvic region. Karen quickly hunches * over to cover it, but it’s too late. *
C: LOLO *
D: * What the fuck is that?! *
E: pointing
C: KAREN * Nothing, I-- * LOLO *
D: * Oh my god, is that your pussy tat?! * You still have it! *
E: laughing
C: AUDREY *
D: It’s even bigger than I imagined! *
C: LOLO *
D: Of course you won’t have sex with *
C: Clarence! It’s HUGE! * DEADEYE *
D: Who’s your artist, it’s very * impressive work. *
C: LOLO *
D: Dude, that thing is fucking * AMAZING! Karen, you fucking ROCK * STAR, I bow down! Pussy tat queen! * Karen, seeing everyone’s positive reactions and just happy to * have not drowned, can’t help but laugh as well. She lies back - * - there’s no need for modesty now that everyone’s seen it. *
C: KAREN *
D: I drunkenly got it one night in * college. You know how I was, * Audrey, I was a mess. I was going * to get it lasered off before the * wedding. It’s just... * * No, I shouldn’t show you. *
E: then, teasingly
C: LOLO * What?! SHOW US! * KAREN *
D: * It’s on the inside too! * And she reaches down and yanks the whole situation open-- we * don’t see it, just the girls’ faces, which is enough. ANGLE ON * Audrey, Lolo, and Deadeye, giddy with shock and horror. *
E: laughing, finally
C: AUDREY/DEADEYE/LOLO *
D: AAA! / AAAA!!!!! / AAAHAHAHA!!!!!! *
C: CLARENCE * AAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *
D: REVEAL Clarence, on the shore, staring RIGHT into Karen’s * pussy tat. His jaw drops. Karen quickly moves to cover * herself. *
E: O.S.
C: KAREN *
D: Clarence?! *
C: CLARENCE *
D: You said you were in trouble... * Clarence holds up his phone . *
E: location sharing is on, showing * the bat signal
C: KAREN *
D: I can explain! *
C: CLARENCE *
D: I-- I thought you were a precious * flower. * Clarence runs away, shocked. Karen goes to run after him but * given that she’s partially nude, she doesn’t get very far. * He’s gone. *
C: KAREN *
D: Oh my god. Ohmygod ohmygod, *
C: Clarence! FUCK! * AUDREY *
D: I’m sure it’ll be okay. He’ll * understand... *
C: KAREN *
D: * What if I told him it was a dare? * Like what if Lolo dared me to get * temporary pelvic body art? *
E: thinking fast
C: LOLO *
D: That’s ridiculous. *
C: KAREN *
D: * No it’s good! He knows you’re * crazy! * From afar, we see a FISHERMAN on the shore taking a photo of * Karen, but the girls don’t notice. Deadeye checks her phone, * straightens up. *
E: frantically texting
C: DEADEYE *
D: Deng is here! * The girls all try to cover themselves, as Lolo’s young cousin *
C: DENG approaches. * DENG *
D: Hello! I am here to take you to * Xitang... * Lolo, indicating to the girls’ lack of clothes: *
C: LOLO *
D: I think we may need to go to Nai * Nai’s first. *

D: Ok! We go to Nai Nai’s! * Deng gestures to a motorcycle. *
C: DENG *
D: Let’s go! *
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY *
D: All of us? On this? *

D: That’s China for ya babe. * As they all climb onto the motorcycle, packing in tight: *
C: AUDREY *
D: How old is Deng? *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Twelve, counting the Chinese way. * So eleven. * Audrey yelps as Deng revs his bike and they’re off! *
S: EXT. MOTORCYCLE - MOMENTS LATER *
N: The four girls, clinging to Deng and each other, whiz past the * countryside on his motorcycle. *
S: EXT. LOLO’S GRANDPARENTS’ HOUSE - EVENING *
N: Deng deposits the girls at the front door and speeds away to * park the motorcycle. They’re pretty dry by now after the * breezy ride, but are still a bedraggled mess. Audrey and Karen * try desperately to arrange their hair and clothes as Lolo * rings the doorbell. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Are you sure it’s okay for all of * us to crash here? *
C: LOLO *
D: Of course! It’s way too late to hit * Xitang now. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: We have a problem. * * The cops are still looking for us. * They put us on a no-fly list, like * we’re criminals or something. *
E: holds up phone
C: AUDREY *
D: What?! *
C: LOLO *
D: Great, even more reason to hide out * tonight. We’ll clear it all up * tomorrow once we’ve gotten the * signature. * Audrey still looks worried. *

N: The girls sit as GRANDMA and GRANDPA CHEN fuss about them. In * the b.g. dozens of ASSORTED RELATIVES are crowded into every * corner and spilling out to other rooms. Every single Chen is * chatting, laughing, smoking, yelling, and most of all * drinking. This family is full of joyous, raucous-- and okay * let’s just say it, trashy-- energy. ANGLE ON Karen and Audrey, * taking in the merry chaos. *
C: KAREN *
D: * Dear god, it’s a thousand Lolos. *
E: quietly

D: * Are you hungry? Of course you’re * hungry! Stupid grandpa should have * bought more food for the house! * Here, have all our fruit! * He grabs a huge platter of fruit off a nearby table and plunks * it on Audrey’s lap. As he peels an orange for her: *
E: to Audrey
C: GRANDPA CHEN *
D: How do you like China?! * * Audrey was born in China but * adopted by white parents. That is * why she is so tan and her face is * so round. * Everyone laughs. *
E: CONT'D to everyone

D: Her accent is terrible! So cute! * * In this house you are family! Gan * bei! * She presses a brimming shot glass into Audrey’s hand and * everyone toasts! Audrey throws back the shot, winces at the * baijiu, but as the relatives pat her back and cheer, we see * she enjoys being part of the family. DISSOLVE TO: *
E: to Audrey
S: INT. LOLO'S GRANDPARENTS' HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT *

E: holding up bones with * chopsticks
C: LOLO *
D: Of course it’s delicious, * everything in China is delicious! * Maybe not yak penis, I probably * shouldn’t knock it till I try it * though. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Is it weird that even though I’ve * never been here before...it kinda * feels like home? *
C: LOLO *
D: Not weird at all, you are home! * Let’s get a photo! * She takes a picture of Audrey; Audrey’s wide, genuine smile * and the scattered empty dishes with Lolo’s family in the b.g. * make it a warm, endearing portrait. Audrey scrolls through * Lolo’s photos on her camera. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Wow, look at all your China * pictures, these are great! *
C: LOLO *
D: Yeah, it’s been kinda nice not * messing with them. They sort of * speak for themselves. *
C: AUDREY *
D: You know, your mom was right, you * should apply to art school with * these. *
C: LOLO *
D: Eh, I would never get in. Plus * don’t you have to like, write an * essay? Uch. * ANGLE ON Karen looking at her phone, her face creased with * worry. The food in front of her is barely touched. *
C: AUDREY *
D: You okay? *
C: KAREN *
D: * It’s just...Clarence hasn’t * answered any of my texts. Or my * calls. *
E: looking up
C: LOLO *
D: Maybe it’s because he knows you’re * lying about the tat. *
C: KAREN *
D: Of course I’m lying! If Clarence * knew who I used to be, that my * nickname in college was Triple * Input Karen-- *
C: DEADEYE *
D: What’s the third input -- oh, the * mouth. *
C: LOLO *
D: If you love him, shouldn’t you just * be honest? *
C: KAREN *
D: I do love him, which is exactly why * I shouldn’t be honest! The truth * would only hurt him. * Lolo stops trying to argue as Karen pours a generous amount of * whiskey into a glass and throws the whole thing back. *
C: LOLO *
D: * OKAY! We’re doin’ it! * Karen grabs the bottle and pours herself more. Lolo and Audrey * are delighted. * DISSOLVE TO LATER: The party continues. Everyone is WASTED. * Karen’s at the center of a group of Chen cousins, rapidly * taking shots of whiskey, SLAMMING each empty down. *
E: impressed

C: DEADEYE *
D: You’re working? You must really * like your job. *
C: AUDREY *
D: I mean, it’s fine. It pays well, * it’s “prestigious” or whatever. And * it means my parents don’t have to * worry about me, which is the least * I can give them after all they’ve * done for me, so... * Deadeye nods, then: *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Excited to meet your birth mom? * Audrey’s surprised that Deadeye, of all people, asked, but... *
C: AUDREY *
D: * You know what? Yes. I mean, I know * we have to, to get my passport * back, but it actually...it would be * amazing to meet her. If we do. I’m * not trying to get my hopes up. * Grandma Chen enters, sees Audrey. *

E: CONT'D then
C: AUDREY *
D: Okay. * * Thank you for making me do this. * You were right-- I’m...I’m glad * we’re here. * Lolo, touched, hugs her. Audrey hugs back, then heads * purposefully for the front door of the house. Lolo snaps a * photo: Audrey’s face filled with emotion as she goes up to the * door and knocks. The door opens to reveal an elderly woman, * HELEN. Audrey reacts, surprised. Helen has to be in her 90s; * way too old to be her mom. *
E: CONT'D to Lolo
C: AUDREY *
D: Hi. My name is Audrey. I’m looking * for... my mother? * Helen shakes her head. Audrey holds out her adoption file. *

C: AUDREY *
D: Oh it’s okay, no thanks... *

D: Who’s taller, me or that stack of * encyclopedias? *
C: KAREN *
D: Do not go stand next to it-- *
C: DEADEYE *
D: I’m gonna go stand next to it. * She’s about to get up when Helen returns with a thick file * folder of her own. She sits down, all business, opens her * folder, takes out a logbook. Finds a page. Points. *

D: 1978, I came here from Seoul. Took * over a business helping Korean * girls who got pregnant. Their * parents send them here, they have * the babies, I get the babies to * adoption agency, Korean moms go * home. Nobody knows, so no shame on * the family. I did this many, many * times.

C: HELEN *
D: No. All in secrecy. When parents * request, I get these girls here, * then I send them back and never see * them again. Never hear from their * families. * * You are the only one who has ever * come back. * Helen’s warmed up now, but Audrey’s too upset to appreciate * it; she looks like she’s about to cry. *
E: to Audrey, fondly
C: AUDREY *
D: You don’t even have a name? I * don’t...I don’t know what... * * I can’t be Korean! My whole life is * a mistake?! * She abruptly stands, shoving back her chair, which hits a * large display case of decorative plates. Most of them fall and * shatter. *
E: blurting

D: * Hey! What are you doing?! * So much for the warmth, Helen is pissed... *
E: angry, in Korean, * subtitled
C: KAREN *
D: * Well, thank you so much! You’ve * been really helpful, and we’re so * sorry, we’ll just get out of your * way... *

N: The girls rapidly walk away from Helen’s house, Audrey looking * like she’s about to fucking lose her mind. *
C: KAREN *
D: * Audrey? *
E: reaching out
C: AUDREY *
D: * My whole life has been wrong. *
E: panicky breathing
C: LOLO *
D: It hasn’t-- *
C: AUDREY *
D: We’re only friends because my * parents were like oooh, another * little Chinese girl! * * We met at Chinese Students * Association! *
E: to Karen
C: LOLO *
D: Okay in everyone’s defense, we were * the only Asians in our whole town, * so we still would’ve been friends. *
C: AUDREY *
D: I don’t even know who I am anymore! * I know nothing about Korea! *
C: DEADEYE *
D: K-pop, Samsung, bulgogi. That’ll do * it. * Audrey ignores her; she’s beginning to have a panic attack. *
C: AUDREY *
D: * And we still don’t know where my * mom is, I still don’t have her * signature, I’m never gonna get my * passport back and I’m never gonna * get back to work on time-- *
E: wheezing
C: KAREN *
D: You will, we’ll find a way-- *
C: AUDREY *
D: Fuck! *
N: Audrey, in full blown panic attack now, sinks onto a nearby * bench. A few long, labored beats as she struggles to breathe. *
C: AUDREY *
D: This can’t be it. This can’t be the * end, we have to find her... *
E: CONT'D
C: KAREN *
D: * Helen doesn’t have any contact * information... *
E: gently
C: AUDREY *
D: No, no, no, we’re finding her. I * need this signature. I need to find * her. * * I want to find her. * The other girls see it in her face: oh shit. For the first * time, it’s not just a matter of the passport. It’s emotional. * It’s her mom. Audrey’s panic attack ramps up again... * Lolo turns to Deadeye and Karen, worried. *
E: beat, voice shaking
C: LOLO *
D: She hasn’t had a panic attack since * we were kids, maybe I should call * Mary and Joe... * * Hey Audrey, can I see your phone? * Lolo gently takes Audrey’s phone and pulls up her parents’ * contact info. *
E: to Audrey
C: LOLO *
D: * Do I need to dial the country code * first, or-- *
E: CONT'D to Karen
C: AUDREY *
D: * Give me my phone. *
E: getting idea; looks up
C: LOLO *
D: No, it’s fine, I’m just calling * your parents-- *
C: AUDREY *
D: * No, the phone number from my file! * We thought it was a Chinese number, * what if it’s in Korea and that’s * why it didn’t go through before? * She grabs her phone back and dials. *
E: getting up
C: KAREN *
D: It’s still a number from decades * ago, the odds are-- *
C: AUDREY *
D: * Hello? * Everyone’s eyes widen-- someone actually answered?! *
E: into phone
C: AUDREY *
D: English? Mandarin? No, oh god, none * of us speak Korean, right? *
E: CONT'D
C: LOLO *
D: * We’ll find someone! *
E: already running off
S: EXT. XITANG STREET - LATER *
N: Back at Audrey’s bench, where a XITANG VILLAGE GUY now holds * Audrey’s phone. *
C: XITANG VILLAGE GUY *
D: * I only speak a little Korean. *
E: subtitled, in Mandarin
C: KAREN *
D: It’s fine, thank you so much. * They hear a muffled voice answer the phone. Xitang Village Guy * begins to speak in halting Korean. Every once in a while, he * turns to the girls and translates it to Mandarin, which Lolo * then translates for Audrey: *
C: XITANG VILLAGE GUY *
D: ...caretaker of a house in Seoul. *
C: LOLO *
D: Okay, the guy on the phone used to * be the caretaker of this house. * It’s in Seoul. *
C: AUDREY *
D: She’s from Seoul?! * Audrey can barely contain her excitement at learning this new * bit of information about her mother. *
C: LOLO *
D: ...he owns it now, I guess the * family moved out a long time ago * and left it to him... Yes! The * owners had a teenage daughter... * that must be them! *
N: Audrey’s face is tense with both excitement and joy; Karen and * Lolo are excited too. They’re SO close! As the Xitang Village * Guy continues listening and translating... *
C: AUDREY *
D: Did he know my mother?! Does he * know her name? *
C: LOLO *
D: Yes! It was the Lee family. Min * Lee. Your mother’s name is Min Lee. * Just hearing her mother’s name makes Audrey tear up. *
C: AUDREY *
D: * Oh my god. Does he still have her * contact info? Can he get in touch? * Another few moments as Xitang Village Guy talks on the phone * and translates to Mandarin for Lolo and Karen. If we’re paying * attention to them, we see their faces falter for a split * second-- but we’re paying attention to Audrey, whose face is * filled with hope and anticipation. Another few beats of * Mandarin and then: *
E: hopeful
C: LOLO *
D: * Yes! * Karen reacts in surprise. Lolo speaks to the guy in Mandarin * for another few moments, then: *
E: long beat
C: LOLO *
D: He’s gonna figure it out and set up * a meeting! *
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY *
D: Aaaaaaa! *
C: LOLO *
D: Aaaaaaaa! We just have to get to * Seoul! *
C: AUDREY *
D: Oh my god! Okay! Oh my god this is * amazing... * * Xie xie! Xie xie! * * Karen? Are you okay? * Karen’s face is a little shocked. *
E: to Xitang Village Guy noticing
C: KAREN *
D: Yes, I’m fine, just so surprised! *
N: Audrey’s freaking the fuck out with joy as Lolo and Karen have * a rapid-fire convo with Xitang Village Guy off to the side. * They finish and thank him; he exits as Lolo turns to Audrey, * aglow with excitement. * [NOTE: what the audience and Audrey don’t know at this point * is that Lolo and Karen have heard via translation to Mandarin * that Audrey’s birth mom is dead; before they got a chance to * decide whether or not to tell Audrey, Lolo jumped the gun and * said the mom wanted to meet her] *
C: LOLO *
D: * Korea, baby! We’re going! *
E: arms up
C: AUDREY *
D: Yes! Korea! *
C: KAREN *
D: But-- but the police are still * looking for us -- we’re on a no-fly * list! *
C: AUDREY *
D: No, no, we have to get to Korea. We * have to. *
C: LOLO *
D: Okay, so we’ll have to sneak out of * the country. * A beat. Everyone is at a loss, then... *
C: DEADEYE *
D: I can get us there. Just do * everything I say and we’ll be in * Seoul by the end of the day. *
C: KAREN *
D: What? How is this supposed to * happen? *
C: DEADEYE *
D: You know who can bypass security at * airports? Kpop stars. *
C: KAREN *
D: We aren’t kpop stars! *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Not yet. *
S: INT. SHANGHAI AIRPORT - DAY *
N: We see a SLOW MOTION POWER SHOT of Audrey, Lolo, Karen, and * Deadeye walking into the airport, looking FUCKING HOT AS HELL: * they are now dressed as a KPOP GIRL GROUP. Short skirts. * High heels. Makeup and hair on fucking POINT. WIDEN TO REVEAL * they have a few other PEOPLE DRESSED IN SUITS scurrying around * them, chattering away on headsets. * As they stride through the airport, we see that Lolo’s having * a ball, Deadeye is unfazed as ever, Audrey’s nervous, but * determined, and Karen, treating this like an acting job, is * matter-of-factly killing it. All around them, people in the * airport stop to gawk, take photos...who ARE these girls? *
C: LOLO *
D: Deadeye, I truly do not know how * you pulled this together. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: It wasn’t just me, it was BTS ARMY. *
C: LOLO *
D: Even if it doesn’t work I’m already * having the best time and will * happily go to jail. *
C: AUDREY *
D: * It’ll work. It has to. Right? *
E: murmuring
C: DEADEYE *
D: Of course. The BTS Army is the most * powerful fandom in the universe. We * always help those in need, * including ourselves. They even * brought their own suits. * ANGLE ON one of the PEOPLE IN SUITS walking with them, who * drops his stern facade for a moment and does a cute, whispered * aside to the girls: *
C: GUY IN SUIT *
D: * Jungkook would be so proud of us! *
E: subtitled, in Mandarin
C: KAREN *
D: You knew all these people online * before? *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Some of them. The guy pretending to * be our manager, yes-- * We ANGLE ON the various people as she describes them-- *
C: DEADEYE *
D: --our fake assistant, no, our * stylist yes, those fake fans over * there, yes-- * There are about a DOZEN “FANS” hustling along after them * through the airport, cheering and taking photos. *
E: CONT'D
C: DEADEYE *
D: --our bodyguard, no, the guy * pretending to my dogwalker, yes. * Thanks for coming, Jaebock. * Deadeye’s internet friend, JAEBOCK , * strides along with them carrying a tiny white Pomeranian. *
E: CONT'D think Joel Kim Booster
C: JAEBOCK *
D: Marshmallow and I wouldn’t miss it. *
C: AUDREY *
D: We needed a dog? *
C: DEADEYE *
D: For realism and texture. *
C: JAEBOCK *
D: * The ARMY prides itself on attention * to detail. We also took down the * Dallas police scanner for Black * Lives Matter, if you didn’t hear. *
E: to Audrey
C: AUDREY *
D: We heard! *
C: JAEBOCK *
D: Amaze. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: So don’t worry. Kpop fans break the * internet daily, I’m sure we can get * four hot girls through airport * security. Isn’t it cool we’re all * hot now? *
C: LOLO *
D: Fuck yeah it’s cool! * They keep walking; the security checkpoint is up ahead. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Just act confident. We’re Brownie * Tuesday, we’re a brand-new group, * we just did our Shanghai debut, our * first single already has 9 million * downloads. Everyone remember their * name? *
C: AUDREY *
D: Sassy. *
C: LOLO *
D: Cutie. *
C: KAREN *
D: Lisa. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: Lisa 2. *
C: LOLO *
D: We got this. *
C: AUDREY *
D: We got this. * SMASH CUT TO: *
S: INT. AIRPORT SECURITY GATE - MOMENTS LATER *
N: Yeah, they might not have this. CLOSE ON the stern, skeptical * face of an AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICER. The girls and their * “entourage” all try not to look worried as he studies their * documents, then gestures for another officer to come over. * They look at the girls, look back at the documents... *
C: AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICER *
D: How long were you in China? *
C: DEADEYE *
D: *
E: confident
C: A week. * AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICER *
D: You’re singers? *
C: KAREN *
D: * I am actually the rapper. * The Security Officer studies a visibly nervous Audrey. *
E: fake Korean accent
C: AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICER *
D: You don’t look like singers. * Audrey’s sweating bullets, about to crack-- and then Deadeye * shoots Jaebock a look. He hoists the Pomeranian menacingly and * steps forward. *
C: JAEBOCK *
D: That is an insult. While they have * just debuted and therefore may not * yet have the seasoned charisma of a * veteran group like BTS or even * Blackpink, I assure you these are * professional idols who, like every * other idol, have been training * since they were 14, 15 years old. * They are dedicated and they are * talented. Show them, girls. * ANGLE ON the girls: Karen, Audrey, and Lolo go wide-eyed in * panic: “what?!” What are they supposed to do now? But then * Deadeye produces a microphone, opens her mouth and SINGS. *
N: Holy SHIT, Deadeye’s voice is AMAZING! The other three girls * are shocked and struggle not to show it. All around them, * people stop to listen, not even just the fake fans, now there * are real ones that Deadeye’s literally acquiring in real time. * It is a MOMENT! And the security agent lets them through! * And with that, we’re into a STYLIZED MUSICAL SEQUENCE: the * song Deadeye was singing continues as the girls strut through * security, towards their gate, stopping for photos, stopping to * wave at fans, generally behaving like kpop stars. They get on * the plane with no problem at all, settle into seats, toast * with champagne glasses... *
S: EXT. AIRPORT - LATER *
N: The plane takes off... *
S: EXT./ESTAB. SEOUL - DAY *
N: The plane lands at Incheon Airport as the SONG ENDS. We’re in * Korea! *
S: INT. INCHEON AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER *
N: The girls walk through the airport. *
C: AUDREY
D: I can’t believe we’re here. Wo men * zai... I don’t know any Korean.
E: then, realizing
C: LOLO
D: It’s okay, you’ll learn it. Everyone says it’s mad easy to pick up new languages as an adult.
C: AUDREY
D: It’s not just the language, it’s everything... She looks around; at all the people, the ads with Korean * products, Korean words... It’s overwhelming. *
C: LOLO *
D: * Are you ready to meet your mom? *
E: gently, to Audrey
C: AUDREY *
D: She’s here? *
C: KAREN *
D: * She said she wanted to meet you at * the airport, so... *
E: nods
N: Karen gestures out at the airport doors. Audrey nervously * walks through, and suddenly... there she is. Even though there * are hundreds of people waiting in the welcome area, Audrey * zeroes in on her. A woman, MIN, early 40s, her face open and * kind, clutching a sign: “AUDREY”. Holy shit. Her mom. The two * women lock eyes, as Min smiles, gives a litte wave. Audrey * approaches. *
C: AUDREY *
D: * Hi... I’m Audrey... * Min beams, tears in her eyes, as she pulls Audrey into an * embrace. Audrey is overwhelmed, but hugs back. CUT TO: *
E: shy
S: EXT. CAFE - LATER *
N: Min and Audrey sit together at an outdoor cafe on a bustling * street in Seoul. Min speaks in halting English: *
C: MIN
D: You’re grown! And so beautiful.
C: AUDREY
D: Thank you.
C: MIN
D: I’ve imagined this moment so often.
C: I--
D: Can you ever forgive me?
E: abruptly
C: AUDREY
D: What? Of course! I mean, but, there’s nothing to forgive--
C: MIN
D: I’m sorry, I just...I was so young, and my parents...
E: emotional
C: AUDREY
D: It’s okay, I understand! I’m just glad you were looking for me too, I’m so happy we found each other... Off Audrey and Min, both smiling, we see Lolo, Karen, and * Deadeye watching them from a table nearby. *
C: KAREN
D: How’s it going? Does Audrey look happy? Are they getting along? *
C: LOLO
D: Will you chill? It’s going great. * BACK ON: Audrey and Min, laughing warmly. *
C: AUDREY
D: --I have so many questions too, I don’t know where to start... Where do you work? Do you have a family?
C: MIN
D: I have a simple life. I’m a teacher * in a small village south of here. *
E: shakes head
C: AUDREY
D: Oh, what do you teach? *
C: MIN
D: English. It’s what I studied in * university. *
C: AUDREY *
D: That must be why your English is so * good. *
C: MIN *
D: I learned it after I had you. * Because I knew, one day we would * meet. And I want to be able to talk * to you. * Audrey smiles, but there’s something that feels off and she * can’t quite put her finger on it. She studies Min’s face... *
C: MIN *
D: So tell me about you! I heard you * are a lawyer? That’s impressive. *
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY *
D: Thank you! I mean, I’m trying. My * boss told me recently that if I * keep doing well I’ll be promoted * soon... *
C: MIN *
D: I knew my daughter would be a hard * worker! *
C: AUDREY *
D: Yeah, it can be tough sometimes, * but it’s worth it. *
C: MIN *
D: You are so smart. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Thank you! *
C: MIN *
D: I knew you would be smart. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Thank you. * Awkward pause. Their first. Min smiles gamely. *
C: MIN *
D: I’m sorry, I just can’t believe I * am finally looking at your face * again. Do you have any other * questions? *
C: AUDREY *
D: *
E: bursting
C: YES! *
D: Min laughs. Audrey giggles too. BACK AT THE TABLE: *
C: LOLO *
D: Okay, look at them. They love each * other. * She pokes Karen, but Karen’s looking at her phone. *
C: KAREN *
D: * Clarence just read all my texts. * Finally. *
E: tense
C: LOLO *
D: Of course you guys would have your * read receipts on. *
C: KAREN *
D: Oh my god, he’s typing... * Lolo spots Audrey approaching. *
C: LOLO
D: That’s great, good for you-- * Hey! How’s it going? Seems like you two are hitting it off.
E: to Audrey, cheery
C: AUDREY
D: We are! But... Karen tries to look engaged, but keeps sneaking glances at her * phone. *
C: LOLO
D: But what?
C: AUDREY
D: It’s probably nothing, but she said she majored in English in college. * But she only started learning after * she had me... *
C: LOLO
D: So? Obviously she was a fast * learner. She’s smart, like you! *
C: AUDREY
D: I guess. But also. Her skin is * like, amazing-- *
C: LOLO *
D: Yeah, right?! Like, spill on that * skincare routine Min! *
C: AUDREY *
D: But she doesn’t have any freckles. * Wasn’t that her nickname? *
C: LOLO
D: She probably got them lasered. Or * covered them up with makeup, Asian * people don’t really like freckles. *
C: AUDREY
D: Yeah, sorry...I’m overthinking it. *
C: LOLO
D: Is she nice though?
C: AUDREY
D: So nice! We’re having a great time--
E: brightening
C: KAREN
D: Oh my god, NO! Clarence! FUCK! * Audrey looks over at Karen, whose face is crumpled with shock * and devastation. *
E: looking at phone
C: AUDREY
D: What’s going on?
C: KAREN *
D: He texted me back... finally... * but... * She starts to sob, flings the phone away. Audrey reaches to * grab it off the ground, and sees the text from Clarence: “Stop * texting me. We’re done” followed by a screencap from a trashy- * looking website: it’s a picture of her PUSSY TATT that the * fisherman took on shore, accompanied by text in both Chinese * and English: “GOOD GIRL GONE BAD!” *
C: AUDREY *
D: Wait, what is this? *
C: DEADEYE *
D: * It’s kind of like Chinese TMZ. *
E: looking MORE
C: DEADEYE
D: Looks like someone got a photo of * her tat. There’s already a gif with * Tweety Bird saying “I thought I saw * a--” *
E: CONT'D
C: KAREN *
D: *
E: increasingly hysterical
C: DON’T SAY IT! * AUDREY *
D: * Karen, don’t worry about this * tabloid trash, I’m sure Clarence * will come around. * Audrey gives Karen’s shoulder a reassuring squeeze, taps off * the Clarence thread so that the tatt photo isn’t on the screen * anymore and starts to hand the phone back...then pauses. Keeps * the phone. Looks at the screen more closely. *
E: firmly
C: AUDREY *
D: Wait. Is that--? * She leans in, looking at Karen’s recent texts. One of the text * threads has a photo of Min...but under the name HEATHER CHOI. *
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY *
D: That’s Min... Why is she in your * phone as Heather Choi? * Karen grabs her phone back. *
E: CONT'D
C: KAREN *
D: I don’t know what you’re talking * about. * Just then, one of the nearby rolling ads on a bus stop flashes * to an ad for sunscreen... and the woman in the ad, * enthusiastically spraying it on, is Min.
C: AUDREY
D: Wait a minute... * Audrey runs back towards Min. The other girls follow, but it’s * too late-- she reaches Min, points to the ad. *
C: AUDREY
D: Is this you? Are you an actress? The ad flashes, changing to something different. *
E: CONT'D
C: MIN
D: What? No, I told you, I’m a * teacher. *
C: AUDREY
D: Yeah, an English teacher in a small * village north of here-- *
C: MIN
D: Yes, exactly. *
C: AUDREY *
D: No! YOU SAID IT WAS A VILLAGE DOWN *
C: SOUTH! *
D: * Why are you-- is this some kind of * con? Am I being catfished? Are you * even my birth mother? * *
E: spinning out off Min’s face
C: You’re NOT! *
D: Audrey steps forward-- is she about to fuck her up? “Min” * backs away, scared, and lapses into AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT.
C: MIN
D: I’m sorry, this was just a job. Min quickly hustles away, squeezing Karen’s elbow as she passes her.
C: MIN
D: See you later Karen. Min’s gone. Audrey turns to her friends, red hot.
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY
D: You know her??
C: KAREN
D: I know this looks bad--
E: busted
C: AUDREY
D: You did this? You hired an actress to pretend to be my birth mother?!
C: KAREN
D: It was Lolo’s idea! Audrey whips around to look at Lolo.
E: quickly
C: AUDREY
D: WHAT. What reason could you POSSIBLY have to do something THIS
C: fucked up?! TELL ME!!
D: Lolo gapes, grasping for the words, but she can’t bring herself to say it. Finally Deadeye breaks the silence. *
C: DEADEYE *
D: * Your mother passed away, Audrey. *
E: quietly
C: AUDREY *
D: * What? * Audrey is stunned. Lolo finally musters the courage to look her in the eye.
E: whispers, tears in eyes
C: LOLO
D: It’s true. The caretaker said Min * passed away... Cancer. *
E: quietly
C: AUDREY
D: Oh my god. * Audrey reacts, it’s a gut punch. A tear runs down her cheek.
C: LOLO
D: We’re so sorry, Audrey. Lolo reaches for her, but Audrey shrinks back. *
C: AUDREY
D: So. Instead of telling me my mother was gone, you thought this was the way to go?
E: as it sinks in
C: LOLO
D: You had that panic attack! And I * didn’t want you to go through this * whole journey and have this be the * end, so I just... I... I fucked up. * I’m so sorry. * Audrey shakes her head. *
C: AUDREY *
D: This is not “fucking up”. Fucking * up is that time you ended up in the * hospital because you tried to do * the cinnamon challenge. Or when you * missed our high school graduation * because you “just forgot”. Fucking * up is what you’ve done your whole * life. *
C: LOLO
D: Whoa, that’s harsh-- * Audrey’s no longer crying.
C: AUDREY
D: Fucking up is being so talented but * too chickenshit to ever take a * chance on yourself. *
E: MORE
C: AUDREY
D: So instead, you go through life * being wild and reckless, saying * it’s because you’re an “artist” who * doesn’t care about money or what * anyone thinks -- but guess what -- * you’re really just a fucking loser who never grew up. You’ve never had * a real job. You still live with * your parents. Grow the fuck up, * Lolo.
E: CONT'D
C: LOLO *
D: But--
C: AUDREY
D: The grownup thing to do would’ve been to tell me the truth. Because I can handle it. I’m not a child like you. Lolo’s in such fucking SHOCK that Audrey would actually say all this out loud, she can’t even defend herself. Karen steps forward.
C: KAREN
D: Audrey, I’m sorry, I should’ve talked her out of it. Audrey stares at her, suddenly quiet.
C: AUDREY
D: I’m not surprised you didn’t. You lie to everyone you say you love. Clarence, me? Lolo was right, you are a fake. Karen reacts, stricken. Audrey gathers her things, fuming, then turns back to Lolo.
E: then
C: AUDREY
D: If we didn’t grow up as the only two Asian girls in town, we never would have been friends. I don’t ever want to see you again. Death blow. There’s nothing left to say. A devastated, completely broken Audrey walks away. *
E: CONT'D then
S: EXT. SEOUL STREET - MOMENTS LATER *
N: Audrey is stalking away down the street when Deadeye runs up to her. She holds out a piece of paper. *
C: DEADEYE
D: You should have this. It’s where * your mom is buried. * Audrey barely even looks at her as she grabs it, continues * down the street. She’s gone.
C: POST FIGHT MONTAGE *
D: Over music, INTERCUT between Audrey, Karen, Lolo and Deadeye: *
S: INT. SEOUL HOTEL ROOM - DAY *
N: Audrey blankly stares at her adoption form, at the empty line * for her birth mom’s signature. She checks a box underneath * marked “Deceased”, then places the form into a hotel fax * envelope. Audrey then looks to her laptop, where work emails * are piling up. She closes it, then curls up in bed and cries. *
S: INT. DIFFERENT SEOUL HOTEL ROOM - DAY *
N: Karen, dressed down with no makeup, sits alone on a rumpled * bed. On her laptop, several different tabs are open to various * gossip websites: a headline reads “WHERE IS CHUNHWA? HAS * SECRET WHORE GONE INTO HIDING?!”. She winces as she sees a * video clip of Clarence, head down, surrounded by paparazzi. * She goes to close the tab, but gets a popup ad for a plastic * surgery clinic -- with tattoo removal! Hmmm. She looks back to * her phone, dials, gets Clarence’s voicemail... *
C: KAREN *
D: * Hi. It’s me again. I’m going to be * 100% honest and tell you everything * I’ve ever done. * * Freshman year of college, I... *
E: shaky deep breath
S: INT. INTERNET CAFE - DAY *
N: Lolo, depressed, posts a story to her Instagram: “does anyone * want to buy a camera? DM me for deets [string of crying * emojis]”. Deadeye sits behind a computer nearby, typing. She * perks up; she’s found something interesting. Beckons Lolo * over. *
S: EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY *
N: A cab pulls up to a graveyard. Audrey gets out, Deadeye’s note * in hand. The cab driver helps direct her to her birth mother’s * grave. Audrey puts down a small bouquet of flowers. * END MONTAGE
S: EXT. CEMETERY - NEXT DAY *
N: Audrey puts down another bunch of flowers at her mother’s * grave, arranging them with the flowers from the day before. * She steps to the side as she gets a work call from Frank. *
C: AUDREY
D: Hi Frank!
E: INTO PHONE forced cheer
C: FRANK
D: There she is! Hadn’t heard from you in awhile, I was starting to worry! Making sure you’re still on for WestStar.
E: ON PHONE
C: AUDREY
D: Yeah I had some passport issues, * it’s a long story, but anyway-- * I’ll be there. My flight leaves * tonight. *
C: FRANK
D: Great! See you tomorrow. Sayonara! * Frank hangs up. Audrey puts her phone away as a man, DAE, approaches Min’s grave, then looks down at Audrey’s flowers. * Curious, Audrey goes up to him. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Hi. Do you know Min? * * I’m sorry, I don’t speak Korean-- *
E: off him
C: DAE *
D: I’m Dae. Min’s husband. * Off Audrey’s surprise, Dae smiles. *
C: DAE *
D: You must be the daughter. *
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY *

E: beat
C: DAE
D: No. But I’m glad to finally meet you. Off Audrey and this unexpected development...

N: It’s a warm, cozy space. Dae pours tea as Audrey looks at a few framed pictures of her birth mother. It’s the first time Audrey has seen her face clearly.
C: DAE
D: --We were only married a few years before she fell sick.
C: AUDREY
D: I’m so sorry.
C: DAE
D: Thank you...they were good years. We never had children of our own-- sorry I could not show you a little brother or sister today.
C: AUDREY
D: It’s okay.
E: smiling
C: DAE
D: But she always talked about you. She was a teenager when she got pregnant, but her boyfriend didn’t want to get in trouble and denied it. Her parents sent her to China until you were born. But she never stopped thinking about you, never stopped trying to find you. *
C: AUDREY *
D: How long ago did she... *
C: DAE *
D: Two years. *
C: AUDREY *
D: If I’d taken a vacation sooner... Audrey struggles to hold it together and not think of all the “what if”s, but it’s a losing battle.
E: suddenly stricken
C: AUDREY
D: If I weren’t so obsessed with work all the time I might have looked for her earlier... and maybe she and I could have... But it’s too late... Dae looks at her; gets an idea.
E: CONT'D
C: DAE
D: There’s something you should see.
N: He puts on his glasses and goes his computer. Pulls up a few files, gestures for Audrey to look:
C: DAE
D: When she got sick, she made goodbye * videos for everyone. Friends, * family... although she was not very * close to her parents after they * made her give you up. Anyway. She * made you one too. * ON MONITOR: it’s MIN, smiling nervously at the camera. She introduces herself in Korean, then:
E: CONT'D
C: MIN
D: Hi. I’m Min. * ON Audrey, amazed to see Min speaking directly to her.
E: INTO CAMERA stilted English
C: MIN
D: Sorry, my English is not good-- Dae’s voice chimes in from offscreen.
E: CONT'D
C: DAE
D: It’s very good! Min gestures for him to hush. It’s charming.
E: ON VIDEO, O.S.
C: MIN
D: I am sorry I could not be part of your life. I wanted to very much... On Audrey, fighting back tears.
E: INTO CAMERA
C: MIN
D: When you were a baby you smiled so big and cried so big! I wonder what you are like now. Are you a doctor, lawyer, teacher? But it doesn’t matter, I’m proud to be your * mother.
E: INTO CAMERA CONT'D
C: DAE
D: It doesn’t matter? Have some standards for your daughter-- Min smilingly chides Dae in Korean. A tear rolls down Audrey’s face, but she can’t help but smile; it’s not just her mother she’s finally seeing, but a slice of her life.
E: O.S., FROM VIDEO
C: MIN
D: I hope this message finds you. And-- Min says a heartfelt line in Korean. Audrey leans forward, what is she saying?
E: INTO CAMERA
C: MIN
D: My daughter. I love you. Audrey is crying, and so is Dae. *
E: CONT'D translating to English
S: EXT./INT. DAE’S CAR - DAY
N: Audrey rides in the passenger seat as Dae drives.
C: DAE
D: Are you sure you can’t stay a little longer? I would love to show * you around Seoul. *
C: AUDREY
D: I want to... but I have to get back for work. Thank you so much for the * ride. It’s so lucky you happened to * be visiting her today. *
E: torn
C: DAE
D: Oh, it wasn’t luck. Your friends * messaged me. Lolo, Karen and... I * must be getting this wrong, but, * Deadeye? * Audrey nods, surprised. *
C: DAE *
D: They found me through the caretaker * at Min’s family house. They told me * you were in Korea, said I might * find you at the graveyard. Did they * not tell you? *
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY
D: Oh, no, we... It’s just, we got * into a little bit of a fight. * They... they lied to me. They lied * and said Min was still ali-- * Her voice catches. *
C: DAE *
D: * It’s okay. I’m sure they did it * from a place of love, to protect * you from hurt. * * Min would do the same thing. She * never told me when she thought I * was getting fat, and sometimes I * have been very fat. * Audrey laughs. *
E: gently then
C: DAE *
D: What is most important is you have * people in your life who love you. * What Min’s passing taught me is * that we all have limited time on * earth... we should spend it with * those we love. * On Audrey as this sinks in. She reaches for her phone. *
E: CONT'D
C: DAE *
D: So where are your friends now? *
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY *
D: I’m not sure... * Off Audrey, looking at Instagram. She clicks on Lolo’s * story... *

D: You okay. *
C: LOLO *

S: INT. PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC - LATER *
N: Karen sits in front of a DOCTOR, who’s explaining the * procedure for the laser tat removal. *
C: DOCTOR *
D: ...With the coloring and the size * of the tattoo, it will take at * least twenty sessions. Do you want * to proceed? *
C: KAREN *
D: * Yes. *
E: sighs
N: Just then her phone dings with a text. Karen looks to it, * confused. Then concern. *
C: KAREN *
D: Actually, I’m sorry. I have to go. * Karen rushes out. *
E: CONT'D
S: INT. FERRY TERMINAL - LATER *
N: The ferry is boarding. Lolo’s phone dings: it’s a text from * Audrey: the bat emoji. *
C: LOLO *
D: Wait! Audrey just texted. * * Why is she sending the bat signal? * Deadeye holds up her phone. She got it too. *
E: then
C: DEADEYE *
D: She dropped a pin to share her * location too. It’s weird, she’s in * the middle of a street. And she’s * not moving. *
C: LOLO *
D: Do you think she got into a car * accident? *
C: DEADEYE *
D: What if she just, like, walked into * the middle of traffic. *

C: LOLO *
D: Are you okay? ‘Cause you sent the * bat signal-- *
C: KAREN *
D: --Which is for emergencies-- *
C: AUDREY *
D: I wanted you all to see this. * She points at a nearby bus stop. The digital ad display shows * one of Lolo’s photos from their trip: it’s a gorgeous * landscape from the riverbank. *
C: LOLO *
D: Wait, what’s happening? *
C: AUDREY *
D: I saw your story. You can’t give up * on photography, Lolo. You’re an * artist. An amazing one. * Lolo realizes that her photos are on display all around them: * on billboards, bus stops, etc. Landscapes, street scenes, a * few of the girls smiling and laughing. They’re all simple, * undoctored, and striking. People nearby look up and admire * them. Lolo’s floored. *
C: LOLO *
D: How did you... *
C: KAREN *
D: Are these all yours? They’re * beautiful. *
C: AUDREY *
D: I know we left things kind of ugly, * but I figured hey, families fight * and make up all the time. I love * you guys. All of you. * Everyone reacts, especially Deadeye, who is happy to be * included. Audrey reaches out and pulls them all into a group * hug. A long beat, then Lolo ear-flicks Audrey, gesturing * around to all the photos. *
C: LOLO *
D: How much did all this cost?! *
C: AUDREY *
D: You know what, not even that much, * Dae really hooked it up. *

E: theatrical fake shock
C: AUDREY *

E: good-natured
C: KAREN *
D: If I can’t run from it, might as * well embrace it. * Karen puts on a brave face, but Audrey senses her sadness. *
C: AUDREY *
D: Have you heard from Clarence yet? *
C: KAREN *
D: * He still won’t return my calls. But * it’s okay. I left him a really long * message-- a few, actually-- and * told him everything I’ve ever done. * So even if he never talks to me * again, at least I was honest. Now * he knows the real me. *
E: shakes head
C: LOLO *
D: Hey, maybe he’ll forgive you. Isn’t * that a Christian thing? That and * that whale that ate a guy? * Audrey’s phone rings; an incoming video call from Frank. *

E: ON PHONE
C: AUDREY *
D: Beckett? *
C: FRANK *
D: He was here when we needed him. * Audrey can’t fucking believe this. *
E: ON PHONE
