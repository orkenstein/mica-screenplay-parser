S: INT. CAR - SAME
N: JOE SULLIVAN drives with his wife MARY in the passenger seat.
N: They’re white, pleasant-looking, in their 40s.
C:                       JOE SULLIVAN
D:           Well, Mary, I think it’s about
D:           time, don’t you think?
C:                       MARY SULLIVAN
D:           I think so, Joe. What about you,
D:           Audrey?
D: Mary turns around and we see her from a BACKSEAT POV. We hear
E: their daughter, AUDREY (age 4).
C:                      AUDREY (AGE 4)   (O.S.)
D:           Yes!
C:                      MARY SULLIVAN
D:           Okay!

S: EXT. PLAYGROUND - LATER
N: Several kids play in the sandbox and on the jungle gym as
N: their parents look on. Everyone is Midwestern, wholesome, corn-
N: fed, and white, except for...
N: JENNY and WEY CHEN (early 30s) approach with their daughter
N: LOLO (age 4). Jenny looks nervously to her husband.
C:                       JENNY CHEN
E:                (subtitled, in Mandarin)
D:           Look at all these white people.
C:                       WEY CHEN
E:                (subtitled, in Mandarin)
D:           I’ve never seen so many of them in
D:           one place before. It’s like a bar
D:           that has board games.
C:                       JENNY CHEN
E:                (subtitled, in Mandarin)

D:           Indiana is like one giant episode
D:           of Friends.
D: Lolo tugs at her Mom’s pant leg.
C:                       LOLO (AGE 4)
E:                (subtitled, in Mandarin)
D:           I’m going to make a sandcastle!
D: Lolo runs to the sandbox and starts digging with her toy pail
D: and shovel. A little BOY comes up to her.
C:                       BOY
D:           Ching chong ching chong choo!
D: Lolo SLUGS him. The Boy yelps, rushing off to find his mother.
D: The Chens look down at Lolo.
C:                      JENNY CHEN
D:           Lolo...
C:                       LOLO (AGE 4)
D:           I know, I know. Sorry.
D: Jenny and Wey can’t help but smile at their feisty daughter,
D: then look up as Joe and Mary Sullivan approach.
C:                       JOE SULLIVAN
D:           Hey there. You must be new in town!
C:                       JENNY CHEN
D:           Sorry, are you the parents of that
D:           racist boy?
C:                       MARY SULLIVAN
D:           Oh no. Just curious: Are you
D:           Chinese?
C:                      WEY CHEN
E:                (warily, “here we go”)
D:           Yes...
C:                       JOE SULLIVAN
D:           Great! Do you mind if our daughter
D:           plays with your daughter?
C:                       JENNY CHEN
D:           Why our daughter?
C:                       MARY SULLIVAN
D:           Well... we thought Audrey might
D:           like to meet her.
D: The Sullivans coax their daughter out from hiding behind them.
D: It turns out Audrey, whose voice we heard earlier, is also
D: Asian! Audrey’s eyes go wide at the sight of Lolo.

D:           Hi.
C:                       LOLO (AGE 4)
D:           Hi, I’m Lolo, I’m four. Wanna play
D:           sandcastle?
D: Audrey nods, yes. As the girls play...
D: BEGIN STYLIZED MUSIC MONTAGE OF THE GIRLS GROWING UP:
D: - The Chens and Sullivans send Audrey and Lolo to preschool,
D: where they stand out amid their white classmates. Audrey looks
D: a little scared until rambunctious Lolo grabs her hand and
D: they head in, smiling.
D: - Audrey and Lolo, now in grade school, stand among a group of   *
D: GIRL SCOUTS. Audrey’s uniform is perfect and her sash displays   *
D: DOZENS of badges; her TROOP LEADER hands her another one and     *
D: Audrey’s face lights up. Meanwhile, Lolo has no badges, eats     *
D: straight out of a box of Thin Mints, and wipes her chocolatey    *
D: fingertips on her uniform between bites.                         *
D: - A ROAST HAM HITS THE TABLE. WIDER to see the Sullivans
D: hosting the Chens for Christmas. Perfect table settings, super
D: civilized. Audrey wears a cute J Crew dress; Lolo wears an
D: oversize Champion t-shirt. The Sullivans say grace.
D: - A ROAST DUCK HITS THE TABLE. WIDER to see the Chens hosting
D: the Sullivans for Chinese New Year. The extended Chen clan is
E: there (including Lolo’s weird, unblinking cousin DEADEYE, 10),
D: diving into the food in a mad scramble. Lolo and her mother
D: are in matching qipaos. Audrey looks wistfully at how much
D: they look alike. Then she shakes it off and wraps an arm
D: around her mom, Mary. Mary beams.
D: - High school. On a sign: “AUDREY FOR PRESIDENT!”. Audrey, 17,
D: hands out stickers to classmates in the hall. Nearby, Lolo,
D: 17, stands under a sign: “SENIOR ART SHOW”. She proudly
D: displays a weird photograph of a cat that’s been altered with    *
D: splotches of paint, feathers, yarn, etc. People walking by       *
D: avert their eyes, disturbed.                                     *
D: - FLASH! Audrey, 21, in college has her picture taken as she
D: receives a Top Scholar Award. More FLASHES as she receives
D: various accolades: Student Bar Association! Captain of the       *
E: Crew Team! President of Chinese Students Association (with her   *
E: co-president, KAREN. We’ll see more of her later).
D: - FLASH! Lolo, 21, nude and smeared with colorful paint, poses
D: for an aggressively artsy photo. WIDEN TO REVEAL it was taken
D: by a camera on a timer against a hastily-hung background.
D: After a moment, Lolo’s mom Jenny enters with a laundry basket
D: and tears down the background, revealing the washing machine
D: behind it. She and Lolo get into an argument.                    *
D: END SEQUENCE.

N: Multiple framed degrees and certificates hang on the walls of

N: neatly displayed on a shelf. On the desk, a name plate that
N: reads “AUDREY HAN SULLIVAN” and photos of Audrey and her         *

N: UNDER THE DESK - curled up on the floor: AUDREY, now 27, is
N: asleep in her work clothes. That is, until she finally hears
N: her phone alarm. She grabs the phone and silences it. She        *
N: emerges from under the desk, shakes off the grogginess, and
N: sits back in her chair, all business. Back to work!
T: QUICK CUTS of Audrey working:
N: 4AM: Audrey’s on a video call with a client in Berlin.
C:                       AUDREY (INTO PHONE)
D:           --Guten Tag, Fraulein Lingenfelter?
D:           I updated the Disclosure Schedules
D:           ahead of schedule. They’re good to
D:           go--
D: 7AM: A chipper Audrey greets a groggy associate, BECKETT, who
D: has just come in.
C:                       AUDREY (CONT'D)
D:           Beckett! I went over your Blitz.com
D:           file-- some references were off, I
D:           went ahead and fixed them for you.
D:           Love the jacket, by the way, I’m
D:           gonna get another coffee, you want?
D:           You look like you want.
D: She hands bleary Beckett the file as she exits.
D: 10AM: In a conference room, Audrey and a senior partner, FRANK
E: (white, 50s, Midwestern), meet with CLIENTS:                     *
C:                       AUDREY (CONT'D)
D:           ...We'll push back on some of these

D:           Yes, but the Japanese firms have
D:           considerable capital, we don’t want
D:           to lose out--
C:                       FRANK
D:           I agree with Audrey, it’s worth a                      *
D:           shot. She’s obviously an expert on                     *
D:           Asian markets.                                         *
D: Audrey looks panicked for a split second-- she’s not an          *
D: expert, actually-- but then recovers and smiles, too used to     *
D: microaggressions like this to be offended. She nods, happy for   *
D: Frank’s approval.                                                *

D:           Congratulations, team, on closing
D:           Heartland Poultry! Big shout-out to
D:           Audrey for taking the lead!
D: Everyone cheers. Frank comes over to Audrey.
C:                       FRANK (CONT'D)
D:           Now that this is done you can roll
D:           onto the WestStar deal.
C:                       AUDREY
D:           Actually, I’m not going to be on
D:           that one. I’m leaving on vacation
D:           tonight--
E:                (off his disappointment;
E:                 quickly)
D:           Only because HR said I had to since
D:           I'm 600 hours over.
C:                       FRANK
D:           Right. Just too bad it’s happening
D:           at crunch time for us. You know, I
D:           shouldn’t be telling you this, but--
E:                (confiding)
D:           --I’m planning on backing you for
D:           partner.
D: Audrey is stunned, delighted.

E:                (passive aggressive)
D:           But this vacation throws a wrench

S: INT. LOLO’S CAR - EVENING
N: In contrast to Audrey’s ultra-together vibe, Lolo is a hot
N: mess and doesn’t give a shit. Her car is filled with
N: photography equipment, paint cans, spools of yarn, wood           *
