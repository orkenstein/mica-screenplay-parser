Despite the fact that they are several printed motifs, they are worn harmoniously and the “van” looks very cute. When the camera ends zooming back, we see the luxurious black SUV of FRANCISCO passing, which is parked a little later, in front of the main door of the building “LA CASA DE LA MOON”. We approach him, who turns off the engine, and he stays for a second with his hands recharged on the steering wheel, as if he had a hard time flipping to see the building.
