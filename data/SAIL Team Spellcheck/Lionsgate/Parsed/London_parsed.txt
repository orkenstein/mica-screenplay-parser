M: WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES ON AN AIRPLANE.
S: INT. AIRPLANE, TRANSCONTINENTAL FLIGHT - EVENING
N: And we see a WOMAN in her late thirties, a modern woman in all the right respects, including combed and tailored, topped by a distinctive red beret, somebody seemingly sure of herself settling into her business class seat. But don’t be misled by her tailoring, her sense of being so put together, she has all the not-so-subtle fidgeting and mannerisms of a charismatic neurotic. Somebody who has embraced her neuroses as to have them become affectations of something she wears as a uniqueness about her, “an artist,” although when stripped naked of her success she is just another neurotic desperate for the peace of control over her universe. But much more about her to come...At this moment she is busily settling into her seat, doing the little things people do to make their seat, like the show “Alone,” building their shelter from the storm, making the seat her sanctuary; putting up the invisible shell from any potential seat-mates, intruders. In short, making it for these next seven hours her home. And like any good Hitchcock, or Billy Wilder movie, the first thing we really hear is a MAN’S VOICE. Sunny, innocent enough, even a little bit fumbling like a Cary Grant, that begins our journey simply with:
C: A MAN’S VOICE
D: I think this is my seat.
E: OVER
N: She blinks away the fantasy that she would have the seat to herself. And we see a MAN in his early forties wearing an overcoat putting his book bag on the aisle seat next to hers. A handsome rough hewn man who doesn’t smile very often, but when he does it is earned and makes us want to know him. Putting his rolling bag up...
C: THE MAN
D: I always forget, is it wheels out or wheels in?
E: a rare smile
N: She thinly smiles but doesn’t say anything as if fair warning she won’t be spending much time talking with him. A Flight Attendant asks if she can take his coat:
C: THE MAN
D: I never remember I have it on. I’m so used to it I could climb into bed and get under the covers still wearing it and sleep like a baby...
E: CONT’D realizing charming
N: He surprises us with an appreciative ironic laugh, giving her the coat...He sits down, getting settled, and tells the Woman beside him, unabashed...
C: THE MAN
D: I was involved with a woman once, a doctor, she was so immersed in thinking about her work she would put her blouse on backwards. You couldn’t tell if she was coming or going...
E: CONT’D that rare smile
N: Despite herself, the Woman smiles.
C: THE MAN
D: I’m Mackensie.
E: CONT’D introducing himself
N: It’s hard to know if it’s his first or last name.
C: THE WOMAN
D: Do people call you Mac?
E: finding herself engaged
C: MACKENSIE
D: Actually, “Doc.” I’m crazy about the movie “Marathon Man.” I’ve watched it like a hundred times... I know it pretty much word for word. Dustin Hoffman’s brother, played by Roy Scheider, was CIA, everything was a secret...I was eleven when I first saw it and I loved secrets. Still do I suppose. He was named Doc, it stuck. The villain was an old Nazi portrayed by Sir Laurence Olivier...he asks him, “Well...can I trust you?” Doc says, ”You never could. You only had to.” The old Nazi says, “We’re talking about my safety.” Doc answers him, “May I be candid?” The old Nazi nods yes...and Doc says, “I couldn’t give a fuck about you...!”
N: Which has Mackensie and her laughing. In spite of himself, she is charmed by him.
C: THE WOMAN
D: I’m Joanna. My father was in love with Audrey Hepburn who was Joanna Wallace in “Two for the Road.” I think he hoped it would give me a sunny disposition. I’m not sure it worked out altogether...
N: Mackensie reaches, sweetly...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Good to meet you, “Sunny.”
N: She smiles and shakes his hand. She settles back, the plane starting to make its way to the runway.
C: MACKENSIE
D: We would have never imagined shaking hands a year ago.
E: CONT’D looking around
C: JOANNA
D: Or taking an airplane.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Or breathing again...Where were you?
C: JOANNA
D: I have a place in Woodstock. The only people I saw were Amazon drivers, my gardener, pool man and one of my two children, Iris, waiting to go back to college. Which never came that year. Her boyfriend and her did exhaust the marijuana supply. You?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I took a trip. I bought an RV, an old Airstream, and traveled from one park to another for the first six months. Do you know they have park hosts?
C: JOANNA
D: I don’t camp much. We went glamping in the Tetons one time, stayed in yurts when the kids were small... cots with pedic mattresses and Sundance blankets, that’s as close as I get to sleeping on the ground.
C: MACKENSIE
D: The hosts get to live for free and take care of the campground. They are a step above homeless. An old rusted trailer, a dented red ATV and chopped wood they sell to campers in their yard. But it’s I suppose as close as you can get, when penniless, to being free. I sat one night with the hostess and her female partner. They seemed as happy as they could be. I read last month how the hostess had been found stabbed to death in their trailer.
E: a beat, without affect
C: JOANNA
D: Oh my God!
C: MACKENSIE
D: They found her partner, the bloody knife beside her, sitting next to her lover’s body...and she said to the Forest Ranger... “I wish it were ten minutes ago...”
C: JOANNA
D: That’s chilling.
E: looks at him
C: MACKENSIE
D: People can be chilling.
E: cold
N: She looks at him, there is something else about him, that has her instincts sense caution, but she lets it go... The AIRPLANE is poised at the end of the runway, the engines picking up speed sending them hurtling down the runway. He sees she is nervously clenching her fist. He kindly puts his hand over hers to alleviate the anxiety...She grimaces a smile of appreciation...He moves his hand as quickly as he put it there not to appear forward...They safely take off...She exhales...
C: JOANNA
D: I never believe it will actually get into the air...and stay there...It takes a good deal of magical thinking...
C: MACKENSIE
D: That’s a nice way to say it...We put our trust in fate.
C: JOANNA
D: Accident or design, the age old question. God or man?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I don’t trust man, and I’m not so sure about God.
C: JOANNA
D: That sounds very lonely.
E: looks at him
N: She’s found some truth about him. He looks momentarily away. His moment reflecting on this, too close to home, is short lived...but what he does say...
C: MACKENSIE
D: That woman, the doctor, I had known was a gerontologist, took care of old people. She told me about a woman who was a patient she had to tell had onset Alzheimer’s. The woman thought about it and asked her, “If I lose my memory, did I ever exist?”
E: by way of an answer
N: It gives her pause for thought...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’ve thought about that long and hard and haven’t come up with an answer. It’s a mystery.
E: CONT’D
C: JOANNA
D: Maybe there isn’t an answer. Maybe no answer is the right answer. Everything isn’t knowable.
C: MACKENSIE
D: We’re quite different, you and I. I need to have conclusion. I need to come to an end.
E: that rare smile
C: JOANNA
D: That sounds ominous. What do you do, Mr. Mackensie?
E: looks at him
C: MACKENSIE
D: Nothing very extraordinary. I’m an adjustor.
C: JOANNA
D: A chiropractor?
C: MACKENSIE
D: God no. I’m not deft enough to crack a back... I would just break it...I’m a claim adjustor. I come quite a bit to London. Our main office is here. I make sure everything is taken care of, neat and tidy. That people get what they deserve. Nothing more. Nothing less. Just what they are entitled to.
E: laughs a small smile after a beat
C: JOANNA
D: That sounds malevolent.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’m the mildest man you will ever meet. Some people say I am so nondescript they can’t remember me. Gray, you know, is a color.
C: JOANNA
D: I don’t believe that. You have, for instance, distinctly hazel eyes. Your fingernails are perfectly cut. You don’t miss a place shaving. Not a hair awry. I think for all you say you try to blend in, to be forgotten, you are quite distinctive... Even your cologne is a healthy musk.
E: and observant sniffs
N: She looks at him.
C: JOANNA
D: I think you are more than meets the eye.
E: CONT’D
N: He doesn’t say anything. A Flight Attendant asks them about drinks. They both settle on Diet Cokes.
C: MACKENSIE
D: You too?
C: JOANNA
D: Me too?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I thought maybe you were in the program.
C: JOANNA
D: I was...I am...You?
C: MACKENSIE
D: Twenty plus years. Dry as a bone.
C: JOANNA
D: Seven. Struggling still.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’ll keep an eye on you.
E: smiles
C: JOANNA
D: I’ll keep an eye on you.
E: smiles
N: They lapse into quiet. After some moments:
C: MACKENSIE
D: What kind of work do you do?
C: JOANNA
D: I’m a mystery novelist.
C: MACKENSIE
D: A novelist. How do you come up with your ideas? From your life?
E: impressed
C: JOANNA
D: Every character’s the writer in disguise.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Have you written anything I would know?
C: JOANNA
D: I write novels mostly about women in distress. My last was called “Girl Downstairs.”
C: MACKENSIE
D: You wrote that? I read that in one sitting on a plane from Amsterdam to South Africa.
C: JOANNA
D: What did you think?
C: MACKENSIE
D: You surprised me. I wasn’t ready for the daughter being her mother the whole time.
C: JOANNA
D: My books are full of surprises, I hope. I can write about it, but I’m not as good with surprises in my everyday life.
E: nods
C: MACKENSIE
D: I try to eliminate all elements of surprise. I can handle things efficiently then.
C: JOANNA
D: That was a fiction I borrowed from a true crime story. It came from a French woman, Jeanne Calment, who claimed she was the oldest woman in the world. She died at one hundred and twenty-three years old. Everyone hailed her. Imagine of all the billions of people that lived and died she was the very oldest ever known. It turns out, like everything, it might not have been true. It was discovered, to avoid paying inheritance tax, they said her daughter had died when it was actually her. Her daughter continued the charade for another 70 years.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Not to be cynical, but I think larceny is a small part of everyone’s soul. Whether it’s a little bottle of perfume you pocket at a department store, or getting your kid into college where they aren’t qualified, or living your life under false pretenses...And if you get away with it...
C: JOANNA
D: I have done some things I wish I hadn’t done.
E: honestly
C: MACKENSIE
D: I won’t ask.
E: a smile
C: JOANNA
D: I wouldn’t answer.
E: smiles
C: MACKENSIE
D: Before I mind my business. Are you writing anything new?
C: JOANNA
D: I don’t know what I’m writing yet. Just thinking about it.
N: The Flight Attendant asks if they want refills.
C: MACKENSIE
D: It’s just the “two” of us alone here...I won’t say a word if you wouldn’t...One small cocktail? Between friends?
E: asks Joanna
C: JOANNA
D: You are bad.
E: smiles, tempted
N: She hesitates.
C: JOANNA
D: I guess I’ve got nothing to lose.
E: CONT’D
C: MACKENSIE
D: Maybe neither of us do.
E: his smile
C: JOANNA
D: Gin and tonic with a slice of lime.
E: to the Attendant
C: MACKENSIE
D: Two.
N: The Flight Attendant leaves.
C: JOANNA
D: It’s been so long I can already feel a tingling in my mouth of expectation in the back of my throat how good it tastes. That didn’t sound right.
E: anticipating fairly blushes, hoarse
N: He laughs at the taste “entendre.” The Attendant returns with their drinks. They both look at them.
C: JOANNA
D: This is a really bad idea?
E: CONT’D reassessing, laughs
C: MACKENSIE
D: Really bad.
C: JOANNA
D: That’s why it’s so tempting.
N: She smiles, enjoying the temptation.
C: MACKENSIE
D: To forbidden fruit.
E: toasting
C: JOANNA
D: Forbidden fruit.
N: She clinks his glass. They drink. Both of them cough, not used to the taste anymore. Their eyes meet and hold. Joanna looks away, obviously upset. She hesitates, then:
C: JOANNA
D: Can I tell you something personal?
E: CONT’D
N: He listens avidly. And she says, startling...
C: JOANNA
D: I’m going to kill myself.
E: CONT’D
N: A beat, Mackensie looks at her, not sure if it’s a bad joke.
C: JOANNA
D: Well, I’m not going to kill myself. I’ve already done it.
E: CONT’D
C: MACKENSIE
D: How do you mean?
E: confused
C: JOANNA
D: Well, it’s not me who’s killing myself, it’s them.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Them?
E: completely confused
C: JOANNA
D: I signed an agreement... four hours ago. Just before boarding the plane.
E: literal looks at watch
C: MACKENSIE
D: Agreement?
C: JOANNA
D: With an agency. A place where they offer unique services, a place you can hire someone who in essence puts you out of your misery; quickly, quietly, and painlessly. It’s called “London.”
C: MACKENSIE
D: You mean, like assisted suicide?
E: trying to make sense of it
C: JOANNA
D: Yes, only with more assistance. The difference is they kill you in such a way that it doesn’t really look like suicide.
N: He looks at her as if questioning her stability.
C: JOANNA
D: I know it sounds like I’m crazy.
E: CONT’D
C: MACKENSIE
D: It’s not normal conversation between strangers on a plane.
E: wry
N: And even she laughs.
C: JOANNA
D: This has to be just between us, because there is a confidentiality clause in the contract, so I’m not actually supposed to talk to anyone about it.
E: intimate, whispers
C: MACKENSIE
D: Who would I tell?
C: JOANNA
D: It’s just...so intolerably lonely. And like you said, you are a stranger after all.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Is this what you still want to do?
E: despite his skepticism, willing to talk
C: JOANNA
D: I do. The contract is non-reversible. I’ll be killed within three weeks.
E: quiet
C: MACKENSIE
D: Is that business days?
E: a smile, not taking it particularly seriously
C: JOANNA
D: Twenty one days. Actually twenty and a half now. I’m flying without a parachute. You’re sitting next to a corpse.
E: not smiling, deadly serious looking at her watch beat
N: She laughs at the dark absurdity, raises her glass to toast him.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I might be old fashioned but I thought murder was against the law.
E: trying to deflect, wry
N: After a moment of hesitation, despite his reluctance...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Between strangers. I’ll buy it.
E: CONT’D toasts her
N: She clinks his glass.
S: INT. AIRPLANE - LATER
N: They’re eating dinner now. One drink has become three.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Do you know how it will happen?
C: JOANNA
D: You’re not told. Only that there are countless ways, and that it will happen within three weeks of the contract being signed. We’re not given any examples either, because that way we would, consciously or not, avoid certain situations. All I was told is that it will be completely painless, and that I really won’t see it coming.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I see.
C: JOANNA
D: Then why do you look as if you don’t see?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’m naturally skeptical and this is beyond comprehending. I guess I probably need an explanation for why you want to kill yourself.
C: JOANNA
D: Danny boy. He was just over from Ireland. He came with a friend of mine to a reading I was doing at the Y. His voice was lilting. For three years he made me feel like I was the only person to exist. We went everywhere...
E: a private beat, and she simply says... a deep remembrance
C: MACKENSIE
D: What did he do?
C: JOANNA
D: He was a playwright. Irish theatre. We would sit and write together in bed. I told him all of my ideas and he was always the best critic and the most ardent fan. My muse. We went and saw a play of his at the four hundred year old Abbey Theatre in Dublin. He stayed to say goodbye to the cast...the theatre by that time had closed...we were leaving...the stage was empty... He kissed me...we made love right there on the stage floor of the set of a Dublin pub...
N: And perhaps we see a glimpse of that, Joanna with a long haired Irish playwright making love on the stage floor. Her eyes are filled with tears...
C: JOANNA
D: We stayed for two weeks in a house in the country in Derry...I had never been so happy...
E: CONT’D
C: MACKENSIE
D: What changed?
C: JOANNA
D: I saw a text. The whole time he had another family...He went home and never came back...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’m sure that broke your heart. But it made you want to hurt yourself permanently?
C: JOANNA
D: It did...it does... I was married twice before. As I said I’m no Audrey Hepburn, I’m not happy that easily. Things didn’t work out. As much for them as for me. I’m not a love addict. But I believe you can find somebody who is perfect for you. Only for you. He was mine. I have had a very difficult time without him. It felt like the end of something, a door closing, forever. That I would never find somebody I loved and nobody would love me that way ever again. It got to the point I was seeing my shrink daily. I literally couldn’t breathe. They say time heals all wounds. I gave it time. But my heart wouldn’t heal. It crushed me day and night. The most terrible deep ache. I thought more and more about doing something rash. I even stood on the Brooklyn Bridge. But I chickened out.
E: she nods, quietly... after a beat
N: And she starts to cry.
C: JOANNA
D: It’s too much for me.
E: CONT’D
C: MACKENSIE
D: I wish I could give you peace.
E: genuinely empathetic
C: JOANNA
D: Got a gun?
E: a wan smile
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’m unarmed.
E: his smile
N: She looks at him, taken with him for a moment...
C: JOANNA
D: You seem like a kind man. Do you have anybody?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I did. She passed away five years ago. April 12th. A Tuesday. She was complaining about a pain in her back for months...when they finally did a scan it turned out she had liver cancer...she died nine months later...
C: JOANNA
D: I’m so sorry...
C: MACKENSIE
D: She was my northern star. For a long time I had nothing to live for. I was so lost and alone I thought the unthinkable at every bridge and tall building and subway stop.
C: JOANNA
D: What changed that?
C: MACKENSIE
D: A friend of a friend recommended me for a job opportunity. I found my calling.
C: JOANNA
D: What was that?
C: MACKENSIE
D: As mundane as it might seem, bringing closure for people. It’s honest work. It’s given me purpose.
N: He’s quiet...she looks at him...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Your playwright would probably call it a curtain call.
E: CONT’D
N: And there’s something deadly honest about the way he says that.
C: JOANNA
D: You are quite different. You seem to be one person and then another. I can’t pin down who you are. One side of you is charming. The other is unsettling.
S: INT. AIRPLANE - LATER
N: The plane completely darkened, people sleeping. Joanna and Mackensie sitting in the dark.
C: MACKENSIE
D: So at most you have twenty-one days to live.
C: JOANNA
D: Soon just twenty and a half.
E: nods
C: MACKENSIE
D: And what do you intend to do with them?
C: JOANNA
D: Do what I’ve never done before. Talk and drink with strangers. Experience new things I would never have experienced.
N: She looks at him.
C: JOANNA
D: Be brave.
E: CONT’D
N: She empties her glass with a long swallow. They share a long look.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I guess if you don’t have anything left to lose, bravery would probably be a good place to start.
N: He looks at her.
C: MACKENSIE
D: How do I know this isn’t all just an idea of yours for your book?
E: CONT’D
C: JOANNA
D: You don’t.
E: a private smile
N: Mackensie gets up from his seat.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Excuse me...
N: She watches him, his strong figure, make his way up the dark aisle to the restroom. She looks down the aisle after him.
S: INT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Finished, he’s washing his hands. There’s a soft knock on the door. He opens it...and Joanna is there. She slides inside, closing and locking the door. She fervently pushes against him. She hikes up her skirt, she fumbles to undo his belt. He lets her at first, then pulls back, hesitant.
C: JOANNA
D: What is it? Are you afraid?
E: stopping
C: MACKENSIE
D: Yes. Women who take sexual initiative intimidate me.
E: a beat, then, sheepishly
N: Which makes Joanna metaphorically embarrassed. She straightens herself...
C: JOANNA
D: It isn’t really my style either.
N: She starts to leave.
C: JOANNA
D: I’m sorry.
E: CONT’D
N: He takes her shoulder and surprising her, tenderly kisses her. And now there is a real intimacy in this closed bathroom inside an airplane.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Are you going on anywhere or are you staying in London?
E: taken with her
C: JOANNA
D: I don’t know why, but I was going to Reykjavik. It sounded adventurous.
C: MACKENSIE
D: It does...
E: without affect
N: She looks at him.
C: JOANNA
D: Do you want me to go?
N: He doesn’t say anything.
C: MACKENSIE
D: What if we fall for each other? I’ve just met you and I would lose you.
N: They just look at each other when there’s a knock on the door. They open the door and the Flight Attendant, seeing both of them:
C: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
D: One at a time, please.
S: INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
N: The dark plane. Under blankets, they have laid their seats flat like a king sized bed...the arm rest all that’s between them...They lay in the darkness...she has raised her shade... The moon bathing them; its white light on them through her window...
C: JOANNA
D: I rarely can sleep in the best of circumstances.
C: MACKENSIE
D: We would make a miserable couple. I can sleep through anything.
C: JOANNA
D: They say that’s a sign of somebody without a conscience.
N: He looks at her in the moonlight...He conjectures...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Isn’t there something we can do? Can’t we buy you out of this contract?
E: whispers
C: JOANNA
D: It’s unbreakable.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Do you still think you’ve made the right choice?
C: JOANNA
D: I don’t really know. I’m like Hamlet, a doubter. Maybe the kingdom of death is worse than the vale of tears.
E: unsure
C: MACKENSIE
D: We can make a run for it.
E: foolish
C: JOANNA
D: Running away...that sounds so enchanting...where would we go?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I would take you to Poets’ Corner at Westminster Abbey, where Yeats and Keats and Darwin lie...
E: imagining
S: INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
N: Christopher Wren’s empty magical and elegant 10th Century church, built through him by the hand of God. Mackensie and Joanna stand looking at the names of the great poets and artists...looking down at their feet metaphorically standing on them...
C: JOANNA
D: Yeats proposed to his lover, an actress Maude Gonne, five times in twenty-five years. She would never leave her husband. He bought a Norman tower and rebuilt it on his country house to her memory. He wrote...”When you are old and gray and full of sleep, and nodding by the fire, take down this book, and slowly read, and dream of the soft look your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep...”
C: MACKENSIE
D: We could take the Chunnel to Paris...
E: OVER
S: INT. THE CHUNNEL TRAIN - NIGHT
N: The lights going by as they sit together racing through the tunnel under the sea...
S: INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
N: She has closed her eyes, drifting...imagining...
C: MACKENSIE
D: We could take the Metro...
S: INT. THE METRO - DAY
N: Riding the Metro.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Go down into the tunnels below Paris...
E: OVER
S: INT. THE PARIS TUNNELS - NIGHT
N: They walk through the tunnels...where people are living all kinds of lives under the city in encampments...someone singing...someone dancing...someone laughing...someone crying...
C: MACKENSIE
D: The Paris opera...
E: OVER
S: INT. THE PARIS OPERA - NIGHT
N: They watch a heartbreaking ballet.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Watch the sunrise over Montmarte.
E: OVER
S: EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP, PARIS - DAYBREAK
N: Sitting on a hotel suite’s roof terrace eating bread and cheese...
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM, PARIS - DAYBREAK
N: Making love in the first light on a bed in a hotel suite...
S: INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
N: He’s quiet, feeling foolish.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I don’t know what got into me. I’m not usually so talkative. I grew up with a stutter...I was taught to swallow anything that I didn’t need to say...
C: JOANNA
D: Don’t stop. It’s so wonderful. I’m falling asleep...
N: Joanna takes a pill box out of her purse...takes up a pill...
C: JOANNA
D: Ambien...mother’s little helper...
E: CONT’D
N: She swallows the pill without any water...She crawls further under the blanket, burrowing...
C: JOANNA
D: Tell me what else we would do...?
E: CONT’D murmurs
C: MACKENSIE
D: Maybe we’ll go to Marrakech...walk in the desert...
E: after a beat
S: EXT. THE DESERT, MARRAKECH - DAY
N: We see that...
S: INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
C: MACKENSIE
D: Or in a hotel on the Amalfi coast...
S: EXT. THE AMALFI COAST - DAY
N: We see that with its eternal light on the Mediterranean...
S: INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
N: And we see he has quieted...Upset, near tears...
C: MACKENSIE
D: My wife and I stayed at the Santa Caterina...We found a piece of Roman glass...
N: We see a blue piece of Roman glass they have found among the rocks on the Mediterranean shore... He’s silent with his thoughts...
C: JOANNA
D: Please don’t stop...
E: her eyes closed, imagining...
N: Gathering his composure...
C: MACKENSIE
D: The fourteenth century moorish castle, Castel dos Mouros, in the town of Sintra in Portugal...
S: EXT. CASTEL DOS MOUROS, PORTUGAL - DAY
N: We see them on the narrow path precariously walking along the ancient castle’s fortress wall...
S: INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
C: MACKENSIE
D: Or off of Africa...the Isle of Lemu...
S: EXT. THE ISLE OF LEMU
N: We see them floating together in the coral turquoise African sea... IN THE DARK PLANE...
C: MACKENSIE
D: It wouldn’t matter where we went or what we did if we had each other...
E: passionately
N: He looks over at her...
C: MACKENSIE
D: If I could give you a fantasy for three weeks I would.
E: CONT’D
C: JOANNA
D: I would go for that.
N: And embracing that thought she gives him a small satisfied smile...Closing her eyes...
C: JOANNA
D: Tell me more.
E: CONT’D murmurs
C: MACKENSIE
D: Walking along a river in Vietnam... Seeing the tigers in India... Sleeping under the stars in the Himalayas...
N: Her eyes are shutting for good...
C: MACKENSIE
D: You’re the writer, I’m sure you could imagine it better than I ever could...
E: CONT’D
N: She looks at him once more as if being certain to remember him...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Sweet dreams...
E: CONT’D
N: And breathing regularly, she is peacefully asleep...He’s quiet, lying in the dark, Joanna asleep beside him. We look at her, head on the pillow, bathed in the darkness... And we come TRACKING along the aisle of people in various positions asleep...and we arrive at Mackensie laying side by side with Joanna in the darkened plane...Joanna sleeping. He’s still. He looks at her figure...her cheek out of the cover...He lays quietly for some moments in the dark, listening to her rhythmic breathing...He fingers a ring on his hand...and opal...He looks at her, he hesitates, a long moment’s indecision...But he has a job to do and he lightly pushes the opal; it slides away...under it we see a small amount of powder...He takes out a sewing needle from his pocket...he licks it, hesitates again, and then judicious like an expert chemist puts it into the powder...The powder sticking to the needle’s wet end...He looks over at her still figure...And ever so lightly he brings the needle to the crevice in her neck behind her earlobe...He starts to stick the needle into the crevice, just enough to draw a small pearl of blood, and seems about to go deeper...when he stops. And making a fateful decision, he withdraws the needle and stows it away...and all that’s left is the smallest pearl drop of BLOOD where the needle had been...as small as a teardrop... And as he quickly dabs the blood away with his little finger...Joanna left to sleep, having felt nothing...As Roy Orbison sang: “In dreams...”
S: INT. AIRPLANE, LONDON - MORNING
N: Great activity; people getting their things to disembark. We see Mackensie shaking Joanna, trying to wake her from a deep sleep...She stirs, groggy...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Time to go.
E: quickly
N: She shakes herself, coming awake...
C: MACKENSIE
D: What are you going to do?
E: CONT’D
N: Her Apple type watch “BINGS”...She looks at it...
C: JOANNA
D: Twenty days left...
N: It’s sobering, she comes fully awake...weighing her options, confused...
C: JOANNA
D: I’m not sure...I don’t know...
E: CONT’D what she’s going to do...
C: MACKENSIE
D: When you do...if you decide to...
N: He puts a slip of paper in her hand...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’ll leave you a key.
E: CONT’D
N: He rushes out of the airplane. She opens the paper: which just says: “Connaught.”
S: INT. BAGGAGE HALL - DAY
N: An African DRIVER meeting him with a sign, simply: “London.”
C: THE DRIVER
D: Hello, sir, welcome back. How was your trip over?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I got drunk and slept most of the way.
E: that smile
N: The Driver laughs. As they come outside:
S: EXT. HEATHROW - DAY
N: It’s pissing rain as only it can in London.
C: THE DRIVER
D: I’m afraid we’ve had a bit of rain, over a week...
N: And as he holds up an umbrella for him, walking through the rain toward a waiting car...
C: THE DRIVER
D: How long are you to stay in London this time?
E: CONT’D
C: MACKENSIE
D: It’ll be quick.
C: THE DRIVER
D: Mind your step...
N: Opening the car door for him...
C: THE DRIVER
D: You’re staying at the usual I trust?
E: CONT’D
C: MACKENSIE
D: The usual, the Berkeley.
E: shakes “yes”
N: As the Driver lowers his umbrella and Mackensie gets into the car...
S: INT. HEATHROW, LONDON - DAY
N: We see Joanna in the main hall looking at the giant departure screens. She can see the flight to “Reykjavik” is leaving in less than an hour. She looks at her watch, making a decision. A Man bumps into her. She virtually jumps out of her skin. He apologizes and moves off. She looks over at other people all around her...any one of them could be her appointed killer.
S: EXT. THE BERKELEY HOTEL - DAY
N: Rain falling on the staid old hotel...We see Mackensie with the help of the African driver exit the car. The Driver carrying his bags walking him under his umbrella to the hotel. They say goodbye, Mackensie taking his bags going inside. The Driver coming back to the car. Taking up his phone, calling someone...As he gets back into the car and drives off...Some few moments...and we see Mackensie, carrying his bags, coming right back out of the Hotel. He gets into a waiting taxi.
S: INT. TAXI, LONDON - DAY
C: MACKENSIE
D: The Connaught, please...
S: INT. HEATHROW, MAIN HALL - DAY
N: The main hall with the giant departure screens. We see that the flight to “Reykjavik” is blinking, “Boarding.” We look for Joanna and see she is gone.
S: EXT. THE CONNAUGHT HOTEL, LONDON - DAY
N: The elegant Hotel in the rain.
S: INT. MACKENSIE’S ROOM, CONNAUGHT, SHOWER - AFTERNOON
N: We see Mackensie under a hot shower...the steam fogging the glass...And the shower door suddenly opens and Joanna, naked, having plainly made her decision, comes in with him. She stops him from saying anything with a kiss...and as they blindly throw themselves into each other, gratefully holding onto each other as if a port in the storm...and as they ardently make love in the hotel shower...
S: INT. MACKENSIE’S HOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Dressed in her red beret and coat, Joanna comes into the living room. Mackensie, dressed again in his suit and his overcoat, is sitting in an overstuffed easy chair. He leans his hands on his thighs like a prizefighter, and he says, forthright...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I am an assassin.
E: simply
N: She stops. He looks up.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I had come to keep your “appointment.” It was arranged for me to sit next to you.
E: CONT’D
N: Before she can say anything...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I have peacefully ended nine other people’s lives. Some of them were terminal...another had a child that had died...most had such grave depression...and now you...
E: CONT’D
N: He pauses, quiet...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I pride myself on doing what I am paid to do and doing it better than anyone else...I always finish a job...I’ve never had that happen to me before...I’ve learned not to feel anything...they teach you that...
E: CONT’D MORE
C: MACKENSIE
D: Your instinct as a human being is if you shoot somebody to reach to help them up...Unless you are a sociopath, you have to learn how to swallow your emotions...and shoot them again and again until they are dead...But I couldn’t...
E: CONT’D
C: JOANNA
D: Why?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I don’t know...something about you...I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time. I can’t even describe it. It was just a feeling. I didn’t want to be apart from you. I wanted to follow our story... where do we go, how do we end up?
N: She’s still, unsure.
C: JOANNA
D: You are very good at what you do. In the most lovely way you gave me the possibility of intimacy, connection, romance, and hope. It was what I needed. And with such skill, you are very seductive. “Call me Doc.” The self-conscious inarticulateness, the stutter. How “you hadn’t felt that way in a long time.” Your wife, your “northern star.” Did you even have a wife?
N: He doesn’t answer her.
C: JOANNA
D: So am I just a three week mercy fuck?
E: CONT’D
C: MACKENSIE
D: Mercy would have been killing you on that plane.
C: JOANNA
D: What if you don’t like me? What if you discover when we’ve run away to Barcelona or Cape Town or who knows where that I don’t match up to your expectations?
C: MACKENSIE
D: Or I don’t match yours...
C: JOANNA
D: What if you regret you didn’t kill me?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I could always kill you.
E: being him
N: She’s quiet knowing that is just so. He gets up and goes to the window...looking outside...
C: MACKENSIE
D: The penalty for not finishing the job is they send somebody to complete what you had contracted for, and for me, now being a liability, end my career.
E: CONT’D concerned
C: JOANNA
D: How will they find us?
E: looking outside
N: His phone RINGS. He looks down at his phone...it just says “LONDON.”
C: MACKENSIE
D: They already have.
S: INT. A LONDON TAXI - DAY
N: Rain running down the windows. Mackensie and Joanna in the back of the hansom cab are embroiled in a heated discussion:
C: MACKENSIE
D: -- They won’t allow that to happen!
C: JOANNA
D: I have to try...
E: adamant
N: And before he can object any further she jumps out of the Taxi...
S: EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY
N: Rain falling. And we see they are parked in front of a nondescript brick building with a few windows and a single name over the doorbell, “London.” She looks up very aware of the security camera looking down on her. She buzzes. A moment and the door sounds opening. She looks for a moment back at the Taxi in the rain, Mackensie in the window...She hesitates and goes inside...
S: INT. THE LONDON AGENCY - NIGHT
N: She climbs up a staircase to a small reception area. Cameras are visible everywhere. Nobody seems to be there, but most immediately a door opens and a YOUNG MAN in an expensive tailored suit answers. Before she can say anything:
C: THE TAILORED YOUNG MAN
D: Ms. Dunlap. Please follow me.
N: He takes her behind the reception door inside. A hallway with some few doors all of which are closed and always seem to be closed. He takes her to a corner office, knocks once, a VOICE is heard, and he shows her in. Where a tall Man in an unremarkable suit, a man with very little affect, is standing at his desk greeting her without a hint there is a person inside him, metaphorically an invisible man...
C: THE INVISIBLE MAN
D: So nice to meet you. I’ve read all your books. “Girl Up A Tree” was my favorite. The way she got her revenge with her husband was so deserved, and felt so real. The way you described the curved spike of the fire poker hitting him clean in the forehead... How you said it made such a little mark for the force that was applied and then seemed to open up his forehead like a puckered fruit. “Puckered fruit.” You do have quite an imagination, quite a way with words, Ms. Dunlap. How can I help you? What seems to be the problem?
E: marvels at the sound of... without a pause
C: JOANNA
D: I’ve had a change of heart. I want to cancel my contract.
N: He furrows his brow.
C: THE INVISIBLE MAN
D: That is not usual for us. Not usual at all.
C: JOANNA
D: I wasn’t thinking clearly when I signed the agreement...
E: simply
C: THE INVISIBLE MAN
D: We understand how upsetting this all must be. The job wasn’t done well, not well at all. He was one of our very best. We can only think he forgot himself and became somehow personally involved. I’m afraid we can’t let that happen. He will have to be removed from the assignment of course, and we will fulfill our obligations. I understand we still have just short of three weeks...
C: JOANNA
D: I don’t want it to happen anymore...
C: THE INVISIBLE MAN
D: I understand...I assume you are well aware of the terms of our contract...Of course once you signed it, it was may I say, “executed.”
E: frowning
C: JOANNA
D: I completely understand what I agreed to...I’m not here about the money, I want the contract voided...there won’t be any need for it anymore...
N: The phone rings. He gets it. He listens. He says...
C: THE INVISIBLE MAN
D: Excellent.
N: He hangs up.
C: THE INVISIBLE MAN
D: That was my manager. He said, despite our agreement, in this rare instance we can make the contract null and void. He is quite a fan of yours also and I think he selfishly wants to read more... I’m glad we could come to a satisfying conclusion. These things can become rather messy. It will be taken care of, removed from the books...thank you for coming...
E: CONT’D personally standing, ending...
N: But something, her story training pokes her intuition...
C: JOANNA
D: Just like that?
E: skeptical
C: THE INVISIBLE MAN
D: We don’t believe in unnecessarily prolonging things.
N: He opens the door, showing her out...
C: THE INVISIBLE MAN
D: I’ll be looking for your next book.
E: CONT’D
C: JOANNA
D: Maybe you’ll be in it...
E: throws off
N: And for the first and probably last time he smiles, a toothy smile of someone who is sure of the eventuality of all things...and he says something all too familiar to us in another context, but here most chilling...
C: THE INVISIBLE MAN
D: Be safe...
E: his final words
N: His smile goes as quickly as it’s come. The door closing after her. She moves back along the closed doors hallway, starting for the stairs...when she sees a Security Guard has come to stand by the front door waiting at the bottom of the stairs with an open umbrella for her. He offers her an accommodating hand, even that seeming malevolent...
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Mind your step on the stairs, they could be wet...
N: And as she goes past him out the door...
S: EXT. TAXI, ANOTHER STREET - DAY
N: The Taxi parked on another street in the rain, Joanna and Mackensie in the back.
S: INT. TAXI - DAY
N: She looks at her watch...
C: JOANNA
D: ...twenty days...
E: looking
N: They’re quiet, looking out at the rain.
C: JOANNA
D: Twenty more days. What happens if they haven’t killed me, they haven’t fulfilled the contract and I manage to live for the twenty-one days, the three weeks?
E: CONT’D
C: MACKENSIE
D: That would make the contract null and void.
N: It gives her a moment’s satisfaction at the possibility.
C: MACKENSIE
D: It’s never happened.
E: CONT’D simply, spoiling that
S: EXT. A SUBURBAN LONDON ROW HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: We see a neighborhood of one after another of small old traditional suburban faux brick English row houses...we already know what each looks like inside; the carpet color, the wallpaper, the linoleum floor in the kitchen, the clock that looks like a cat with its wagging tail keeping time... When we see an overweight fastidiously dressed MAN in his early sixties carrying a large wrapped gift get out of a chauffeured car. With his hat and finely tailored suit, that despite his size fits like a well made glove, he looks like a barrister or an MP, or a latter day version of Alec Guinness in “The Ladykillers,” elegant, graceful, and deadly. We will come to know him as MR. LIME. He goes up the steps to the row house. The door is open, welcoming...
S: INT. SUBURBAN ROW HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: He comes quietly inside...so quiet that women busy in the kitchen don’t notice him...He goes out a patio door...
S: EXT. SUBURBAN ROW HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: ...where various families are sitting around a small backyard...children playing at a birthday party...He silently stands apart holding his gift...when a little Boy comes cautiously over to him...The Boy stops, intimidated by him...
C: THE LITTLE BOY
D: Grandpa.
E: shyly
N: The Man takes the Boy’s little arm bringing him closer, but not quite to him...as near as he gets to touching someone much less hugging someone...He gives him the gift...The Boy looks if it is alright to open it...
C: MR. LIME
D: Yes, certainly, open it...
N: The Boy opens it...It’s a large stuffed horse...the Boy is delighted...rubbing its mane...
C: THE LITTLE BOY
D: Mummy, look what Grandfather brought me...
E: turning
N: A harried Woman looks over...The Boy returns to his Grandfather, but he’s already, like the end of the day, disappearing as quietly as he came... And we hear Mackensie’s VOICE, OVER.
C: MACKENSIE
D: You’re going to go to a quiet bar by the Thames known as the White Lion.
E: OVER
S: INT. MOVING TAXI - NIGHT
N: Mackensie and Joanna in the back of the hansom cab on their way somewhere...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Have a drink by yourself...
E: OVER
S: INT. THE WHITE LION - NIGHT
N: And we see Joanna sitting virtually alone at the bar in a quiet lonely pub having a drink...
C: MACKENSIE
D: When you pay, leave a note with your bill that you intend to kill yourself by jumping from a bridge. And leave right away.
E: OVER
N: Joanna writing a “suicide” note on a paper napkin, folding it, leaving it with her bill and her payment under her empty glass...Getting up and leaving the bar right away...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Go to the Vauxhall Bridge...
E: OVER CONT’D
S: EXT. THE VAUXHALL BRIDGE, OVER THE THAMES - NIGHT
N: We see Joanna coming along the distinctive bridge over the Thames, stopping, looking down at the water...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Wait until nobody else is in sight...
E: OVER
N: The Bridge road emptying, becoming quiet...Joanna on the dark street looking down at the dark water, nobody else around...
C: MACKENSIE
D: It is high enough to break your neck and if that doesn’t kill you the freezing water will...I disposed of a difficult subject there once...I had tried to kill him in the most painless, efficient of ways...
E: OVER CONT’D
N: And WE SEE IN RAPID MACABRE SUCCESSION: THE TUBE MACKENSIE WALKING BY A MAN STANDING HOLDING ONTO A STRAP ON THE TUBE, STUMBLING INTO HIM WHERE WE SEE HIM QUICKLY INJECT HIM WITH THE SMALL BUT DEADLY SEWING NEEDLE IN THE HAND...
C: MACKENSIE
D: A small prick, a toxin much like I was going to give you...
E: OVER
N: AND AS THE MAN IS UNAWARE WHAT HAPPENED BUT A “BEE STING,” AND RUBS THE SITE, WHILE MACKENSIE GETS OFF THE TRAIN...
C: MACKENSIE
D: For whatever reason it didn’t work...
E: OVER CONT’D
N: HYDE PARK THE MAN TAKING IN THE SUN LAYING ASLEEP ON THE LAWN IN HYDE PARK...MACKENSIE WALKING OVER...
C: MACKENSIE
D: You would be surprised what a common handkerchief can do...
E: OVER
N: ...BENDING DOWN AND COVERING HIS FACE WITH A HANDKERCHIEF, COVERING HIS NOSE AND HIS MOUTH UNTIL HE STOPS BREATHING... AND WALKING OFF...
C: MACKENSIE
D: And for some reason that didn’t work either...
E: OVER CONT’D
N: STARBUCKS THE MAN IN A STARBUCKS ENJOYING A CUP OF COFFEE AS HEAD DOWN HE READS A BOOK...WHEN WE SEE MACKENSIE WALKING BY AND DEFT, WITHOUT AN UNNECESSARY MOVEMENT, PUTS SOMETHING INTO HIS COFFEE AND WALKS ON...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I gave him enough to kill a horse but that didn’t do it either...I had run out of options...so that finally...
E: OVER
S: EXT. THE VAUXHALL BRIDGE - ANOTHER NIGHT
N: THE MAN STANDING ON THE BRIDGE LOOKING OUT AT THE WATER. WE SEE A BIKE RIDER APPROACHING HIM. AS HE COMES CLOSER WE SEE IT’S MACKENSIE. HE STOPS, GETS OFF HIS BIKE, GOES TO STAND SOME SLIGHT DISTANCE FGROM THE MAN LOOKING OUT AT THE WATER.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Lovely evening.
N: The Man nods...Mackensie comes closer...
C: MACKENSIE
D: That’s where James Bond has his office...Where his Majesty’s Secret Service, MI-6, is.
E: CONT’D motions across the way at a building, his smile
N: The Man looks over at the distinctive building.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’d had enough.
E: OVER CONT’D
N: ...and Mackensie, having had enough, picks the man up under the arms and simply throws him over the railing...Mackensie getting on his bike riding off accompanied by a resonant sound somewhere between a splash and a splat.
S: INT. (MOVING) HANSOM CAB - NIGHT
N: She looks at him remembering if she needed a reminder just who he is.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’m kidding!!
E: his smile
N: (Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t)...but she chooses as we do to be on the side of the better part of angels and she laughs on our behalf a hoarse laugh, appreciative...
C: MACKENSIE
D: What you will do...
E: CONT’D going on
S: EXT. THE VAUXHALL BRIDGE, LONDON - NIGHT
N: Joanna on the dark quiet Bridge over the Thames...
C: MACKENSIE
D: When there is no one else in sight, you will leave your shoes on the bridge...and walk away...
E: OVER
N: And we see Joanna, doing as planned, once the bridge is empty, taking off her shoes and leaving them on the bridge by the railing, and walking away...
S: INT. THE WHITE LION BAR BY THE THAMES - NIGHT
N: We see the Bartender reading the “suicide” note on the napkin she had left...and going to the phone, dialing...
S: EXT. THE CONNAUGHT HOTEL - NIGHT
N: When we see Mr. Lime coming out of a taxi, putting on his hat, going into the Hotel.
S: INT. THE CONNAUGHT - NIGHT
N: We see the elevator arrow coming to a stop on a particular floor. We see Mr. Lime getting out. He crosses to a room. He lightly knocks. Quiet. He knocks again. Nothing. Using a pass key he goes inside.
S: INT. MACKENSIE’S ROOM, CONNAUGHT - NIGHT
N: He looks around the room. He goes into the bedroom...the made bed...into the bathroom...the discarded towels...Strands of Joanna’s hair in the sink...He goes into the living room. He looks at the slightly sunken form on the overstuffed chair cushion where Mackensie had sat. He meticulously fluffs the pillow bringing it back to shape. He sits down on the couch content to wait. He takes up the phone.
C: MR. LIME
D: Room service.
S: EXT. THE THAMES - NIGHT, LATER
N: When we see Joanna’s shoes she left on the bridge circled with chalk and protected by crime scene tape. And now we see Police are collected on the bridge over the Thames, a HELICOPTER circling, a Police craft in the water, where two divers are in the water searching... WHEN WE SEE A PAIR OF WOMAN’S BOOTS COMING ALONG A STREET.
S: EXT. A LONDON STREET - NIGHT
N: Where we see Joanna, wearing boots now, carrying her suitcase, Mackensie beside her, carrying his, hurrying along a London street...
S: INT. CONNAUGHT, MACKENSIE’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: We see Mr. Lime sitting at a room service table, wearing a bib and consuming a lobster. His phone rings. He answers without saying anything. He listens. He hangs up. He gets up, taking off his bib, straightening himself. He takes a last roll, buttering it...puts his hat on and goes out.
S: INT. CORRIDOR, CONNAUGHT - NIGHT
N: He patiently waits for the elevator. It arrives. He goes into the elevator. As he stands with his hat on, finishes the buttered bread in one bite, the elevator door closes and he is gone.
S: EXT. THE THAMES - NIGHT
N: The Police scene on the bridge and in the water. And we see Mr. Lime with his distinctive hat coming out of the dark, crossing the bridge arriving at the scene...He says something to a plainclothes officer...they seem to know each other... The Detective shows him the “suicide note,” protected in an evidence baggie...He motions at their feet on the bridge... And Mr. Lime, spreading a handkerchief on the pavement and kneeling on it so as not to get his pants dirty, kneels to look at Joanna’s shoes left there...He comes to his feet, retrieves his handkerchief, folds it neatly back up and puts it inside his coat pocket. He looks at the activity on the water...And as he turns and looks off down the street into the night not believing for an instance anybody has killed themselves there this evening...
S: INT. TAXI, LONDON - NIGHT
N: A Taxi moving quickly with Mackensie and Joanna through London...they’re both quiet, their lives upended...and Joanna sees the magnificent edifice of Westminster Abbey.
C: JOANNA

D: It’s closed.
N: Mackensie goes to the door talking to a Guard...taking out his wallet showing something to him...The Guard opens the gates...
C: JOANNA
D: How did you?
E: CONT’D hurries to Mackensie
N: He opens his wallet showing her a small pin with a distinctive letter “L” for “London,” and an angel figure for either an “angel of death” or an “angel of mercy.”
C: MACKENSIE
D: It can open or ...close doors.
E: chilling
S: INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
N: They come inside...it’s empty, dead quiet...She looks at the roof, awestruck by the majesty...their feet echoing...on the ancient stone floor...
C: JOANNA
D: Kings and Queens have been coronated here since 1066...
E: in a reverential whisper
N: She looks at the timeless “Coronation Chair.”
C: MACKENSIE
D: I promised you...
N: She turns and he’s come to “Poets’ Corner...” The gravestones of the people who talked to God.
C: JOANNA
D: Imagine being buried here for eternity with the greatest writers of the written word...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I can arrange it...
E: his smile
N: She manages a smile...but she is still in the glory of the eternal church...the poets’ graves at their feet...
C: MACKENSIE
D: My father said sometimes you have to stand on someone else’s shoulders to be tall enough to see the sky.
E: CONT’D
N: She’s touched...and for letting her experience this...Looking at him, this man she chose to put her life in his hands... near tears...she says simply...
C: JOANNA
D: Thank you...
S: EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT
N: The Taxi driving off, Mackensie and Joanna, luggage in hand, running down the street to a TRAIN STATION.

S: INT. THE CHUNNEL TRAIN - NIGHT
N: They find their seats as the train pulls out of the station.
C: A MAN’S VOICE
D: Next stop, Paris.
E: OVER
C: JOANNA
D: Why Paris?
C: MACKENSIE
D: You haven’t lived if you haven’t shared Paris with someone you... care about...
E: he hesitates
C: JOANNA
D: You sure know how to melt a heart...
N: (But) she isn’t convinced...
C: JOANNA
D: How am I to trust you?
E: CONT’D
N: He doesn’t say anything...they ride in silence...and her watch makes its familiar distinctive “BING.”
C: JOANNA
D: Nineteen days.
E: CONT’D
N: ...And choosing to believe in him she puts her head on his shoulder...He puts his arm around her...And as they race in the dark under the sea...
S: INT. PARIS GARE DU NORD STATION - MORNING
N: The train having reached its berth. People streaming off. Mackensie and Joanna carrying their luggage moving with the crowd going into the terminal. A WOMAN stops Joanna, causing her to start...
C: THE WOMAN
D: I’m so sorry. Could you tell me where you got these boots? They are quite attractive.
E: in French
C: JOANNA
D: Thank you. I got them at Barney’s in New York...
E: in fluent French she looks at the boot label
N: The Woman thanks her and moves along...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Don’t stop for anyone whatever the reason...
E: cautioning her...
N: She nods properly chastised...as they move with the people...
C: MACKENSIE
D: You speak French fluently?
E: CONT’D
C: JOANNA
D: My mother taught French in high school. We always spoke at home. She tried me at ballet. It wasn’t pretty...I had three left feet...
N: He smiles, moving her quickly along with the crowd... And we see from ON HIGH, all of the people pouring out of the station. When somebody catches our eye. And we see Mr. Lime in his distinctive hat is standing on a balcony overlooking the crowd of people as they go out. He looks at his cell phone where a Security Camera surveillance video is playing with a time stamp of Joanna and Mackensie getting on the train in London...Mr. Lime standing on the balcony overlooking the station looking for Joanna and Mackensie. As the people go by below him...Mackensie and Joanna move among the crowd approaching the main terminal...Mr. Lime above them up ahead...When Mackensie suddenly stops, kneeling as if to tie a shoe...Joanna waiting...but this isn’t an accident...he waits until the crowd has all but disappeared...and standing, taking her arm:
C: MACKENSIE I wasn’t thinking...crowds are
D: deadly...
N: And he leads her to an Emergency Exit and despite the warning “ALARM WILL SOUND,” he quickly takes her out the door...The ALARM sounding after them...While Mr. Lime, from his grand perch, watches what is left of the people coming off the train leaving the terminal. The terminal emptying. And as he stands on the balcony the terminal emptied and all that’s left is the sound of the Emergency Exit ALARM going off...He looks across the empty station at the Emergency Exit door that hasn’t fully closed after them, a shaft of daylight streaming in where they had gone out.
S: EXT. PERE LACHAISE CEMETERY, PARIS - DAY
N: We see Joanna and Mackensie coming through the timeless cemetery...going past “Moliere’s” gravestone, “Chopin,” “Abelard and Heloise,” “Oscar Wilde...”
C: JOANNA
D: Wilde said, “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars...”
E: mentioning
N: And “Proust...”
C: JOANNA
D: “The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new lands but seeing with new eyes.”
E: CONT’D
C: MACKENSIE
D: You make everything an adventure.
E: taken with her
N: She doesn’t say anything...He comes by “Jim Morrison’s” grave with an array of bouquets.
C: MACKENSIE
D: He said, “Love me two times, love me two times baby...One for tomorrow and once for today...”
E: CONT’D his smile and he sings
N: She laughs, forgetting for a moment their situation, enjoying him...As they move through the cemetery...
C: JOANNA
D: Why are we here?
E: despite everything
N: He turns to another row and comes to stand over a small gravemarker. She comes alongside him. The gravemarker says, “Nora Weathers,” “1977-2017,” “She sleeps in the laps of the Gods.”
C: MACKENSIE
D: She wanted to be buried here. We came to Paris for the last month of her life. There wasn’t a moment we wasted.
N: Joanna is quiet.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Nora, this is Joanna. I wanted you to meet her.
E: CONT’D
N: Joanna is moved by that...
C: JOANNA
D: I’m sorry I didn’t ever know you, Nora.
C: MACKENSIE
D: She knew you in a sense. She liked your books. I can still see her curled like a cat on a window seat with your book in her hand, her brow furrowed with concern for the story, reading...
C: JOANNA
D: He still loves you.
E: as if reassuring her
N: And after a moment...remains jaundiced...
C: JOANNA
D: How do I know any of this is true, this isn’t some random grave?
E: CONT’D
N: He doesn’t say anything...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Does it matter?
E: pure him
N: She’s quiet. And wanting to believe him she takes his arm...
C: JOANNA
D: I’ve never been to the Eiffel Tower.
S: EXT. EIFFEL TOWER - NIGHT
N: Mackensie once again, the Tower being closed, talking to some guards, showing them his pin.
S: INT. EIFFEL TOWER ELEVATOR - NIGHT
N: The two of them in the glass elevator going up the glorious steel structure.
S: EXT. EIFFEL TOWER, OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT
N: Standing on the observation deck looking at the world at their feet...
C: MACKENSIE
D: You are a lot like Audrey Hepburn. But I think more in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. “Moon river...
E: and more talks than sings...as romantic as you can get MORE
C: MACKENSIE
D: Two drifters, off to see the world, There's such a lot of world to see We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend, My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me.”
E: CONT'D
N: She looks at him, taken with him, and says...
C: JOANNA
D: You bastard.
N: A breeze threatens Joanna’s beret to blow away...Mackensie stops it, his hand gently on her head...She looks up at him...and again, moved, simply says for everything...
C: JOANNA
D: Thank you.
E: CONT’D
S: INT. FOUR STAR FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: We see Mr. Lime alone eating a many course Michelin meal at an elegant French restaurant. His phone buzzes. He looks and sees he’s been sent a Security Camera PHOTOGRAPH of Mackensie and Joanna going into a French hotel. As he frowns at his meal being interrupted and wipes his mouth with his napkin...
S: INT. FRENCH HOTEL, BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Joanna and Mackensie asleep together in bed. He awakens to the sound of a VOICE outside speaking French. He wakes Joanna.
C: MACKENSIE
D: How do you say in French, “I won’t be long?”
C: JOANNA
D: Je ne serai pas longue...
E: waking
C: MACKENSIE
D: He used the wrong word and said, “Je ne serai pas ‘bientot’...” “I won’t be ‘shortly’...”
N: There’s the sound of the Man’s VOICE again, saying something else...
C: JOANNA
D: French isn’t his natural language.
N: He hurries to the window...and he sees Mr. Lime in his distinctive hat coming into the Hotel.
C: MACKENSIE
D: They sent somebody... Throw on your clothes...we have to go...
E: pulling her up
N: They both throw their clothes on...she grabs up her book bag...while still putting on their clothes he hurries her out of the room...
S: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
N: They see the elevator ARROW coming to their floor. He hurries her to the stairs where he can see two flights below them Mr. Lime in his distinctive hat coming up the stairs...He pulls her to where a cart is in the door of a room being serviced.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: The Housekeeper starts with a fright. He motions her to be quiet. She’s terrified. He takes her cell phone from her pocket...he moves her into the bathroom...he breaks apart the bathroom phone, motions her to be quiet again...and closes the door on her. He goes to the door looking out the EYEHOLE. He can see through the EYEHOLE Mr. Lime moving along the corridor to their room.
C: MACKENSIE
D: That would be Mr. Lime. He is the last person you will want to see; because he will be the last person you will see...
N: Mr. Lime puts on some kid gloves. He takes off his shoes. He uses a card key silently opening their room door. As he goes without a sound inside...
S: INT. NEARBY ROOM - NIGHT
C: MACKENSIE
D: We have to disappear...
E: at EYEHOLE quickly
N: And as he takes her out of the room...
S: INT. MACKENSIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
N: The dark room. Mr. Lime, for some reason takes out a pen, silently clicking it at his side while in his stocking feet he pads silently across the carpet into the dark BEDROOM. He raises the innocuous looking pen and in a motion folds it at an angle to reveal a tiny trigger, turning it into a miniature .22 pistol with the smallest of silencers called a “Stinger Pen,” it defines small but deadly...as deadly as the cattle truncheon the killer, Javier Bardem, carried in “No Country for Old Men.” And without a moment’s hesitation he fires into the bed...the dwarf pistol spitting bullets...the bed, the mattress, in spasms of fire, literally smoldering... But coming closer he sees it’s empty, the vicious tiny and efficient pen gun in hand, standing in the dark room over their empty bed. He hears a car door closing. He goes to the window looking outside. He sees Joanna and Mackensie getting into a Taxi and being driven away. He says to himself the license number...he takes up his phone...texts the taxi number to someone...pushes send...He goes into the living room. He turns the pistol back into a pen putting it neatly back where it belongs in his pocket. He takes up the Hotel phone. And as his dinner was interrupted:
C: MR. LIME
D: Room service.
N: They answer.
C: MR. LIME
D: To start, onion soup, with extra cheese...
E: CONT’D
N: WHEN SUDDENLY THERE IS A BURST OF SUNLIGHT.
S: EXT. A FRENCH COUNTRY ROAD ON THE WAY TO CHANTILLY - MORNING
N: And we see a modern rental PEUGEOT (what else) coming along a French country road.
S: INT. PEUGEOT - MORNING
N: Joanna is driving, she looks in the rear view mirror where she sees Mackensie is seemingly asleep laying across the back seat. She looks at him for some moments thinking how she got herself into this situation. She looks away, still in the thought, driving. When we see Mackensie isn’t as asleep as he seems. And he suddenly sits up, putting his hands around her throat...and silently and swiftly breaks her neck...the car rolling to a stop... When we see she is still driving, looking again in the rear view at him asleep in the back seat, his murderous hands on her neck all in her head. And she sees he’s come awake looking in the rear view at her.
C: JOANNA
D: I imagined you weren’t really asleep. That you strangled me...
C: MACKENSIE
D: You’ve written too many books.
N: He climbs into the front seat.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Why would I want to hurt you?
E: CONT’D
C: JOANNA
D: You seem to have made a way of life of it.
C: MACKENSIE
D: In my other life.
E: trying to reassure her
N: She doesn’t say anything. And as she drives with an assassin as her companion, running away...
S: EXT. FRENCH FARMHOUSE ROAD, CHANTILLY - DAY
N: They drive up an overgrown road to an old two story French farmhouse. The house in disrepair from disuse...a barn... fields fallow...They get out...
C: MACKENSIE
D: It belongs to my sister from her divorce...she hasn’t been here in years. It’s a bad memory for her...
N: They stand looking at the old forgotten house...
S: INT. FRENCH FARMHOUSE, CHANTILLY - DAY
N: They come inside. It is as unused and in as much disrepair as the exterior...as if somebody had just up and left all their things and never returned...They walk through the house...the various dusty and unused rooms...suddenly three CATS living there as startled by them as they are go racing by them out a broken window...
C: JOANNA
D: “Chattes.” Cats frighten me.
E: shivers says the French word
C: MACKENSIE
D: Didn’t you have a cat on the cover of one of your books?
C: JOANNA
D: Very good. “Girl Up A Tree” had a cat stuck up a tree, representing a woman in trouble on the cover.
N: It leaves an unsettling feeling as they continue through the empty house...
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
N: They’ve come back outside, looking at the grounds...an empty swimming pool, forlorn rusted chaises with rotted cushions... They go into the BARN...where there is still a vintage late 60s wine colored CITROEN CONVERTIBLE...the key right where it was left...he starts it...after some tries it kicks over...he shows her how its front compression humorously raises and lowers its front end...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Do you want to try driving it?
C: JOANNA
D: I don’t know how to drive a manual shift.
S: EXT. FRENCH FARMHOUSE, CHANTILLY - DAY
N: Joanna behind the wheel of the Citroen, Mackensie beside her...Joanna fitting and starting, killing the motor, jerking and braking, trying to learn using the clutch how to drive the stick. As she lurches through an overgrown field the car nearly disappearing in the tall grass...and in a final paroxysm the car coming to a sudden quit as if it had given up...They laugh at the absurdity of it. They look at each other, the circumstances, this choice they’ve made. He hungrily kisses her. And as they fuck in the old wine colored convertible Citroen in the middle of the overgrown field...
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE, CHANTILLY - NIGHT
N: The farmhouse lit against the dark countryside. There’s the sound of a TYPEWRITER.
S: INT. THE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
N: A bottle of wine is on a table...and Joanna having found an old typewriter is typing on a piece of paper...some few pages she’s already done in a beginning pile...
C: JOANNA
D: The “e” and the “t” is broken.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Try to write without using them.
E: OVER
N: She smiles at the impossibility of that.
C: JOANNA
D: I have a book idea in mind...I haven’t had that in quite awhile.
E: enthusiastic
N: Enjoying the classic nature of the typewriter...
C: JOANNA
D: It makes me feel like a real writer...
E: CONT’D as she types
N: A CAT comes in the window walking across her typewriter. She starts, chasing it away. The cat racing back out. She settles going back to writing. There’s a sound of him on the stairs.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Don’t move!
E: OVER suddenly
N: She turns and sees he has found an old but deadly looking shotgun. And he’s leveling it at her...
C: JOANNA
D: Please don’t point that at me...
N: He raises it, to demonstrate...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Don’t worry, it’s empty...
N: He pulls the trigger and the gun EXPLODES with a deafening roar blowing a hole in the ceiling.
S: EXT./INT. CENTRE GEORGES POMPIDOU MUSEUM RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: The distinctive Centre building. We see Mr. Lime through a window, sitting at a window, in their most elegant of restaurants, eating steak fritte, surrounded by the great art in the Pompidou Centre. His phone sounds. He opens a text. There’s a SECURITY PHOTOGRAPH OF MACKENSIE WITH JOANNA DRIVING THE PEUGEOT OUT OF A RENTAL AGENCY. He shuts his phone, and getting up...
S: INT. FRENCH FARMHOUSE, CHANTILLY - LATE AT NIGHT
N: Mackensie asleep in bed. He senses Joanna isn’t there. He comes down the stairs.
C: JOANNA
D: I couldn’t sleep...it’s too quiet... Do you think they’ll find us here?
E: after a beat
N: He doesn’t say anything which is her answer. When ABRUPTLY the farmhouse DOOR BURSTS OPEN. They virtually jump up. And they see two armed GENDARMES have come bursting through the door. They motion them not to move.
C: GENDARME
D: What are you doing here?! The neighbors are saying the house is supposed to be empty.
E: French
C: JOANNA
D: He wants to know what we are doing here?
C: MACKENSIE
D: Tell them it’s my sister’s house... Carol Watson...
E: calmly
N: She tells them. The Gendarmes confer...One goes outside...He returns...confirms...
C: GENDARME
D: It is owned by the Watsons...How long do you plan to stay?
E: French
N: He glances to Joanna...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Not long.
E: in French
N: They accept that, leaving...They’re quiet, well aware they are on borrowed time. And if they needed a reminder her watch “DINGS.”
C: JOANNA
D: Eighteen days.
S: EXT. CHANTILLY - DAY
N: We see the Peugeot parked on a street in the beautiful and timeless Chantilly. Joanna getting out of the car, her hair stuffed up under a broad brimmed farm sun hat as best as possible hiding her face. She crosses into a Boulangerie.
S: INT. BAKERY, CHANTILLY - DAY
N: It’s empty. A young woman baker in an apron who is very, what is the best word, fetching? (In French seduisante, enticing), different than attractive, someone by her secretive demeanor makes you want to know much more about her. In her late twenties with a number of curious tattoos that on her pale skin make you drawn to want to touch them; who has a constant enigmatic smile as if waiting to be surprised, is taking some bread out of the oven. Seeing Joanna, and there is an immediate glint she is attracted to her...
C: THE WOMAN
D: There is nothing like the taste of fresh bread the moment it comes out of the oven.
E: in French, subtitles
N: And without being asked she tears off a piece, literally putting it into Joanna’s mouth.
C: JOANNA
D: It’s hot...
E: fending with, in French, subtitles
N: And they will exclusively speak in French with subtitles:
C: THE WOMAN
D: Of course, you know just what you are getting. It is supposed to awaken your senses.
E: a laugh
C: JOANNA
D: It did that.
E: laughs
N: They smile at one another.
C: THE WOMAN
D: I’m Lilou.
C: JOANNA
D: A lily.
E: English

C: LILOU
D: That was such a sad story.
E: CONT’D
C: JOANNA
D: Sad story?
C: LILOU
D: The Watsons. Her husband’s cancer. And ending like that so... “softly.” They were quite in love. He told me he didn’t want her to have to suffer through his death so he went away for the end...
E: searches for the word
C: JOANNA
D: Yes, it’s just terrible.
E: shaken
C: LILOU
D: The house has been empty for such a long time. She loved sunflowers, she had a beautiful field of sunflowers. What do you folks do?
C: JOANNA
D: I work for an interior design magazine. My friend sells international real estate.
C: LILOU
D: New Yorkers.
E: knowingly
C: JOANNA
D: We’re easy to spot.
E: her smile
C: LILOU
D: Excuse me.
N: She buttons an open button on Joanna’s blouse.
C: LILOU
D: You came undone.
E: CONT’D smiles
N: She smooths her blouse down for her. Joanna isn’t used to women touching her, but doesn’t dislike how it feels.
C: JOANNA
D: I would like a loaf of bread...and where can I get some small groceries?
E: remembering her purpose
N: Putting it in a bag Lilou gives her the fresh loaf of bread.
C: LILOU
D: This I made for you.
E: her smile
C: JOANNA
D: I couldn’t,
C: LILOU
D: You have no choice.
E: her way, a seductive smile
S: INT. A FRENCH RESTAURANT, PARIS - DAY
N: Mr. Lime eating a fancy omelet in a famous French breakfast restaurant with a chicken motif, chicken figurines, chicken drawings and paintings...chickens everywhere...His phone “Dings.” He looks at a text where there is a SECURITY CAMERA PHOTOGRAPH of Joanna getting out of the Peugeot on the Chantilly Street. He expands it to see it says “Chantilly,” on a store behind her. As he finishes his omelet among all the chickens:

D: A woman in distress.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Your books are always about women in distress.
C: JOANNA
D: Either you write what you know or what scares you. This is both.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Is it about our situation, about us?
N: She doesn’t say anything.
C: MACKENSIE
D: How does it end?
E: CONT’D
N: Before she can answer him there’s a startling KNOCK on the door. They both go still. Mackensie takes up the poker, goes to the door. He hesitates and poker ready answers the door. And LILOU, hands full with a fresh loaf of bread, a bottle of wine, a small bag of groceries, and a bouquet of sunflowers is standing there.
C: LILOU
D: I’m Lilou. I met Joanna today. I wanted to welcome you.
E: in French, subtitles

C: MACKENSIE
D: You didn’t mention you met someone?
E: to Joanna, a hint of anger
C: JOANNA
D: She owns the bakery.
N: Mackensie nods but is far from fine with it...
C: LILOU
D: My English is not so very good... How do you say it, I am always one word before the other...?
N: But as all French women who don’t speak English it is delightful...
C: MACKENSIE
D: You say the wrong word...
E: charmed
C: LILOU
D: That is it...Can I put this somewhere...?

He slices his finger...his finger bleeding onto the bread, his blood seeping into the bread turning it a malevolent doughy red...
C: JOANNA
D: That’s not good...
N: Lilou says something in French...
C: JOANNA
D: She said you are jealous...
E: CONT’D
N: Joanna laughs at the insanity of it all. As she takes his hand, putting his finger under the faucet, blood running on the white porcelain sink...Something is rotten in the state of Denmark children...

C: JOANNA
D: No. It’s just right.
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Mackensie standing just off the porch watching two cats drink from a bowl of milk he has brought them; the sky blanketed with stars in the unknowable night. And we hear the soft sounds of the women from an upstairs window...As he walks off, dealing with his feelings...
S: INT. THE FARMHOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Mackensie alone in bed in their dark room...and we see Joanna climbing into bed with him...There’s the SOUND of the farmhouse door closing, Lilou leaving. Mackensie and Joanna in bed laying back to back.
C: JOANNA
D: You are not allowed to ask. This was just mine.
N: He nods. They’re quiet. After some moments:

E: calmly but forceful, and without fear...
C: MR. LIME
D: I’m Mr. Lime. I understand we will be working together.
E: busy writing
N: He finishes what he is writing and puts his tiny notebook back inside his coat pocket and capping the pen puts it into his shirt pocket. And a cat of hers jumps onto his lap. He quietly strokes it. If we had any doubts about her we don’t have any, anymore.
C: MR. LIME
D: I don’t usually work with anyone else.
E: CONT’D
N: He sees some folders, even a copy of Joanna’s book, “Girl Up A Tree,” with the cat stuck up the tree on the cover.

S: INT. LILOU’S BOULANGERIE - MORNING
N: Some people are getting their daily bread, a large old hearth type bread oven cooking racks of bread...Lilou sees Joanna, gives her a secret smile. She hurries through the customers. The moment the shop is empty she turns the sign to Closed, “Fermee.” And the two of them alone fall into each other’s arms, kissing. Lilou takes her by the hand, going out of the shop and holding hands up the stairs.
S: INT. LILOU'S APARTMENT - MORNING
N: They lay onto the bed passionately kissing. Lilou turns her over onto her stomach, kissing Joanna’s neck, her back... Joanna in the throes of passion when she sees a cat’s dish of milk under a nearby table. And everything seems terribly wrong. She stiffens.

D: I’m not feeling very well...I need to go back and lay down...I’m sure I’ll be better later...I’ll come back...
N: Lilou nods. Joanna starts out the door...when Lilou sees the cat’s milk bowl and realizes her “cover” is blown...And as Joanna is on her way out...Lilou suddenly grabs her around the neck, pulling her back inside, closing the door...Joanna fingers the razor blade slicing at her arms...Lilou grabs up a hammer...and despite being cut up hits Joanna with the hammer in the chest, knocking her down...and straddling her is about to crush her skull when the door bursts open and Mackensie is there...he pulls Lilou off of her...Lilou hitting him with the hammer knocking him backwards...Joanna scrambles to her feet...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Go to Chantilly...! You’ll be safe there...
E: trying to fend Lilou off; to Joanna, says again
N: Joanna hesitates but listening to him scrambles out the door running down the stairs...Lilou and Mackensie wrestling for the hammer, literally bursting out the door...Lilou far tougher than one would imagine, hammering at him, the two going over, Mackensie trying to fend her off as they roll down the stairs...She manages to get to her feet, running into the bakery shop. He comes after her...she grabs up a deadly bread knife...she literally sinks it into his upper chest by his shoulder...he manages to keep his balance, her hand on the knife trying to bury it deeper into him, him trying to fight her off...when he manages to gather the last bit of his strength and rushing her literally pushes her into the bread oven...slamming the hearth’s metal door...I don’t want to sicken you by the obvious sounds she makes but assume whatever she yells is in French. He extricates the knife. He stumbles out of the shop leaving a trail of blood...
S: EXT. CHANTILLY TOWN - DAY
N: He moves as best he can along the street, the trail of blood following him...people afraid giving him wide shrift...as he stumbles to the Citroen...starts the car and races away...
S: INT. THE CITROEN, ON THE ROAD - DAY
N: Driving with his one good arm...a pool of blood on the floor at his feet...
S: EXT. THE FRENCH ROAD - DAY
N: The wine colored car racing along the road.
S: INT. THE CITROEN - DAY
N: Up ahead he sees a particular sign that says “Chantilly.” He pulls into a parking lot crowded with cars. He gets out.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
N: There is the muffled sound of something being announced. He makes his way toward the entrance. And as he gets closer we realize that this is, the stables built in 1720 in the reign of Louis XV, and the racecourse from the 1850s, THE ELEGANT AND BEAUTIFUL GRANDSTAND AND CHANTILLY RACETRACK.
S: EXT. CHANTILLY RACETRACK - DAY
N: He comes outside onto the apron of the crowded racetrack. A race is running. He takes an escalator upstairs. He looks from the second deck down on the track looking for Joanna...As he moves along the stands looking for her...
S: EXT. CHANTILLY RACETRACK - DAY
N: We see Mr. Lime approaching the entrance. And we see on his phone is a Security Camera photograph of Joanna going into the track.
S: EXT. CHANTILLY RACETRACK - DAY
N: When we see Joanna, down on the apron among the crowd, looking everywhere for Mackensie.
S: EXT. GRANDSTAND, RACETRACK - DAY
N: Mackensie, drops of blood at his feet, looking for Joanna.
S: EXT. THIRD LEVEL, GRANDSTAND, RACETRACK - DAY
N: Mr. Lime, looking through small but powerful binoculars down at the people. WE SEE what he sees, moving across the people’s faces, looking for Joanna. And then, we see her through his binoculars. He stops. He takes his eye away. Joanna down below him on the apron in the middle of the crowd. He gets on an escalator going down.
S: EXT. RACETRACK - DAY
N: Joanna looking all around...
S: EXT. THE RACETRACK - DAY
N: And Mackensie sees her...he moves as quickly as he can to the escalator...he looks around him...and he sees just behind him on the escalator above him is Mr. Lime. He pushes past people hurrying down the escalator. Mr. Lime sees him. He pushes past people on his own...Mackensie reaches the apron...he goes running for Joanna...Mr. Lime, taking out his pen, reconfiguring the pen into its deadly pistol, coming steadily after them...Mackensie makes it to her and without a moment’s hesitation grabs her...moving her through the crowd...Another RACE has begun...the crowd caught up in the race...while they hurry through the crowd, Mr. Lime just after them...He stops, fingering the lethal trigger, aiming it...he has them clear in his sights running from him...He fires...the pistol’s retort a deadly sneeze in the sound of the crowd...He’s come up just short, the bullets ricocheting off the concrete after them...They look back...He aims to fire again...When Mackensie suddenly ducks with her under a railing...and they literally run onto the TRACK...
S: EXT. THE TRACK, CHANTILLY - DAY
N: The horses thundering down toward the finish line...They run across the track...Mackensie pulling her right into the path of the oncoming horses, causing chaos, jockeys fighting to avoid them...While they just make it through the equine gauntlet...Mr. Lime watching them get to the other side...Where we are running with them into a large open grass field...and as they just keep on running, and running, and running away... WHEN WE SEE A SMALL COMMUTER PLANE SUDDENLY LANDING.
S: EXT. A PLANE LANDING IN CORSICA - DAY
N: A small plane landing at FIGARI, SUD CORSE, the small bump of an Airfield on the Mediterranean Island.
S: EXT. FIGARI, SUD CORSE AIRFIELD, CORSICA - DAY
N: The plane taxiing to a stop. Some fourteen people, Joanna and Mackensie among them, coming down the stairs of a small plane, going into the tired terminal.
S: INT. THE TERMINAL, FIGARI AIRPORT, CORSICA - DAY
N: Nothing much more than a gate with a small waiting area and one large customs room. Mackensie is well aware of the Security Cameras as they go into the customs hall. They come through customs.
C: CUSTOMS OFFICIAL
D: Purpose of your visit?
E: Italian, subtitles
C: JOANNA
D: Holiday...

C: MACKENSIE
D: What don’t you speak?
E: impressed
C: CUSTOMS OFFICIAL
D: How long are you planning to be with us?
E: Italian, subtitles
C: MACKENSIE
D: Two weeks.
N: She looks at him as if to say, “We are?” As he stamps their passports:
S: EXT. BONIFACIO, CORSICA - DAY
N: They carry their luggage up a hill of the small town overlooking the sea.
S: INT. A SMALL CORSICAN HOTEL - DAY
N: They check into a small hotel.
S: INT. SMALL HOTEL, THEIR ROOM - DAY
N: Mackensie, his shirt off, his shoulder heavily bandaged, is standing on their small patio looking out at the sea. She comes outside beside him.
C: MACKENSIE
D: If we can disappear for two and a half weeks it will be over. The two things they do are either enforce their contracts, or honor them...
C: JOANNA
D: How many people who have changed their minds have -- ?
N: He doesn’t answer her which is the answer...And as if on cue her watch “BINGS.”
C: JOANNA
D: Sixteen days.
E: CONT’D ominous after a beat MORE
C: JOANNA
D: Disappear for two weeks? How do we do that?
E: CONT’D
S: EXT. BONIFACIO, HARBOR, CORSICA - DAY
N: The busy harbor. Signs advertising: “Boats For Charter, Daily, Weekly...” And we see Mackensie with Joanna on the deck of a solid SAILBOAT...Mackensie talking to a Captain... they shake hands...the Captain going into the wheelhouse...
C: MACKENSIE
D: You know how to sail?
C: JOANNA
D: I wrote about it once.
N: As she shakes “no”:
C: MACKENSIE
D: That makes two of us.
N: She hesitates...and as he smiles his smile he is playing with her...
S: EXT. THE MEDITERRANEAN, CORSICA - DAY
N: And we see that once the SAILBOAT is out of the harbor, Mackensie, an adept sailor, is busy setting the sails...the boat taking on wind picking up speed, going out to sea. Joanna watching him, graceful, athletic, moving around the boat, maneuvering the ropes, the sails, between handling the wheel, keeping their course... She looks over at Mackensie at the wheel...
C: JOANNA
D: Where’d you learn to sail?
C: MACKENSIE
D: After my wife died I spent six months alone on the sea.
N: She looks at him...
C: JOANNA
D: How do I know that’s true?
C: MACKENSIE
D: Does it really matter? As long as I can get us from here to there...
N: She continues to wonder just who she has signed on with...a loving husband or an assassin or both?
C: MACKENSIE
D: Hold onto this until I yell...
E: CONT’D throwing her a rope
N: She holds the rope as he raises another sail...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Let it go!
E: CONT’D
N: She lets the rope go and as a large sail unfurls, the sailboat cutting through the water; Joanna breathing the air, wind blowing across her...She embraces herself, no matter the circumstances, feeling for the first time in quite a long time, alive...
S: EXT. A COVE, CORSICA - DAY
N: The sailboat anchored in a secluded island cove...Joanna and Mackensie bobbing in the deep blue Mediterranean...She swims over to him. As he pushes back her wet hair and they hold onto each other in the water, knowing all they have is each other...hungrily, almost fearfully, kissing...
S: EXT. THE MEDITERRANEAN - DAY
N: We see from a distance Mackensie rowing Joanna in a wooden dinghy to a small island...
S: EXT. AN ISLAND OFF CORSICA - DAY
N: They walk along a goat path on an abandoned island...
C: JOANNA
D: ...It was said Cleopatra secretly met with Mark Antony here...
N: She motions...
C: JOANNA
D: Their boats were on either side of the island...She came up one way...he came the other...
E: CONT’D
N: And from Joanna as an author’s point of view WE SEE: CLEOPATRA IN ALL HER GLORY, BUT JUST A WOMAN HERE, AND MARK ANTONY, THE RELUCTANT WARRIOR, HAVING COME UP SEPARATE PATHS ONTO THE ISLAND, THE STAR CROSSED LOVERS SEEING EACH OTHER, COMING TOGETHER...WALKING A GOAT TRAIL, TALKING... DESPITE THE WORLD ON THEIR SHOULDERS JUST MORTALS ON THIS COIL... TIME LAPSE to Joanna and Mackensie tracing their steps coming to the aged remaining foundation of a wall...
C: JOANNA
D: This is a fort Alexander the Great built three thousand years ago...
E: CONT’D
N: She sits down her back against the remains of a wall... Mackensie sits beside her...A breeze, like time calling, blows across them...
C: JOANNA
D: Just imagine they may have sat right here...touched these stones...It’s hard to fathom but it wasn’t a story, they were real, flesh and blood...Maybe they laughed about something...maybe they talked about whatever their dreams were...He gave her as a wedding gift what is now the entire Middle East.
E: CONT’D taken, like a spell
N: He smiles at the enormity of that. She’s quiet...The timeless breeze ruffles their clothing...
C: MACKENSIE
D: What are your dreams?
C: JOANNA
D: I thought I had run out...I didn’t think anything was possible anymore... Then I met you.
E: she looks at him, for better or worse
N: They’re still...He doesn’t look at her but he says...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I love you.
N: She turns on him.
C: JOANNA
D: Don’t say that! I don’t believe you. I don’t believe you about anything. You don’t know me.
N: And the impact of Lilou and her death, the tenuous circumstances they are in, under the gun, she starts to cry, releasing her emotions...She hangs her head...He puts his arm around her, comforting...
C: JOANNA
D: As a writer you’re supposed to be able to live in someone else’s shoes... I’m just another of my characters, a woman in distress...
E: CONT’D ironic
C: MACKENSIE
D: You’re far more real than that...
N: And as they sit where Cleopatra and Mark Antony once did, a different kind of world on their shoulders...in this movie called “London.”
S: EXT. FIGARI, SUD CORSE, AIRPORT, CORSICA - DAY
N: We see a plane disembarking. People coming down the commuter plane’s mobile stairs. And among them, wearing a white linen suit and a Mediterranean style straw hat, is the ineffable ever-present shadow of Mr. Lime.
S: EXT. THE SAILBOAT IN THE COVE - NIGHT
N: The sky an incredible array of stars. Joanna and Mackensie sitting on the deck, Mackensie showing her a map book.
C: MACKENSIE
D: We’re here...
N: Charting their course...
C: MACKENSIE
D: There are at least twelve stops we can make in coves like this, around the island, away from people, and not be found for the remaining time...
E: CONT’D
C: JOANNA
D: I know nobody has...but...What if we actually run out the clock...we somehow make it...? What happens when we don’t need to escape?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I try to stay with what’s in front of me. I haven’t made long range plans for a very long time.
N: She’s quiet.
C: JOANNA
D: Can you see us together?
C: MACKENSIE
D: We are together.
C: JOANNA
D: I mean after this?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’ll leave it to you to write the ending.
E: a small smile
C: JOANNA
D: Sometimes you just don’t know until the end.
N: They look at each other, neither sure of what is going to be...And as if God wanted them to consider other things, it starts to rain...a sudden downpour...they are completely soaked...and as they laugh, running inside for cover... THERE IS A MAN SINGING OPERA.
S: INT. A SMALL RESTAURANT, BONIFACIO, CORSICA - NIGHT
N: A small restaurant known for its pasta and clams. Mr. Lime alone at a table having vongole and pasta, a bottle of wine, bon appetit! And a waiter, another thing the restaurant is known for, its singing waiters, is singing OPERA. There is a small crowded bar. A group of young people in their late twenties, crew from various boats, in their shorts and t- shirts and sandals, talking too loud, drinking and laughing. Amongst them, but separate, a particularly handsome couple, a very fit and handsome man, reminiscent and as good looking as say Tom Cruise, and an equally fit and attractive woman, come there for the sea, are having drinks, eating octopus. There is a burst of noise from the young people. Mr. Lime, his meal, his peace interrupted, unhappily looks over. His eyes meet Tom Cruise and the young woman’s...it’s brief, the young people, along with Mr. Lime, looking away. As he returns to his clams and pasta with the opera:
S: EXT. THE SAILBOAT - NIGHT
N: The boat in the cove in the rain squall.
S: INT. THE SAILBOAT, BERTH - NIGHT
N: And Joanna and Mackensie, the rain sounding on the portholes, making love on their boat. There is the familiar “BING” stopping them.
C: JOANNA
D: Fifteen days.
N: And as they go back to where they left off with, if possible, even more urgency:
S: INT. LIME’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mr. Lime in his linen suit having some fresh strawberries. There’s a light knock on the door. He doesn’t bother to get up but just makes a sound that it’s open. An African Woman, an obvious professional, comes in. When we see some money has already been left on a nearby table. Without further conversation, or ado, he unbuttons his fly. She starts to undress. He shakes no. She kneels to him. As he bites into a strawberry, and I hate to do this but I have no choice not to, and some of the strawberry’s juice runs down his chin... WHEN WE SEE THEIR SAILBOAT CUTTING THROUGH THE WATER.
S: EXT. THEIR SAILBOAT ON THE MEDITERRANEAN - DAY
N: A pristine day. The boat moving through the water...He’s got Joanna handling the wheel, enjoying the adventure, while Mackensie is up a mast, swaying under his weight, releasing a rope to free a smaller jib...He suddenly stops, seeing something on the water...He comes scampering down the mast...Coming to her...He motions...she looks where he is pointing...There is a sailboat on its side, swamped...heads bobbing in the water...He grabs the wheel making their way to them...Getting there he sees a sailboat is capsized, and sinking...a Man and a Woman, neither of them in life vests, in the water...Hurrying, taking off his shirt...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Hold its course to make a circle...
E: telling her
C: JOANNA
D: I can’t -- !
C: MACKENSIE
D: You can...!
N: And he jumps with his trousers on into the water...
S: EXT. THE MEDITERRANEAN - DAY
N: ...as he swims to the people in the water, in distress, by the capsized boat...We now see they are the YOUNG COUPLE FROM THE BAR. The Tom Cruise and his partner. She is seemingly unconscious, a nasty gash on her forehead, bleeding...He is struggling to keep her head above water...trying to keep her from going under...Mackensie, reaching them, grabs her from further going under, keeping her afloat...And holding onto her, the young man swimming alongside him, he swims her to their boat...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Drop that sail...
E: yells to Joanna
N: Joanna manages to figure out how to untie the sail...the sail coming down...the boat gone dead in the water...She reaches to help the young Man onto the boat...Mackensie struggling to get the woman out of the water...onto the boat...
S: EXT. SAILBOAT, THE SEA - DAY
N: Once the young woman’s safely aboard...she’s motionless... Mackensie bends, giving her mouth to mouth...she begins coughing, gasping for air...he sits back, catching his breath, exhausted...The Young Man comforts his partner... Joanna comes with a blanket for her, wrapping her in it while she sits on the desk regaining her composure...
C: CODY
D: We don’t have much experience...I never sailed before...Millie sailed when she was younger...We decided to try to take a sailboat, take an adventure...what do you call it, bareboating? We tried to make a turn and then sail took in too much wind and the boat suddenly capsized...Millie cracked her head open on what are those things...those things you put ropes around...?
E: finding his breath
C: MACKENSIE
D: A cleat...
C: CODY
D: 
E: somewhat hysterical, talking a mile a minute MORE
C: CODY
D: ...and we were thrown into the water...Millie was stone-cold out...I did everything I could to keep her head out of the water...If you hadn’t shown up I couldn’t have held her much longer...she would have drowned...
E: CONT'D
N: And as if to emphasize things, they can see their CAPSIZED SAILBOAT taking on water and going, with a finality, dead under.
C: CODY
D: I didn’t take the insurance...
E: CONT’D
C: MACKENSIE
D: That’s not good...
E: pure Mackensie
C: JOANNA
D: Are you alright?
E: kneeling by Millie
N: She nods.
C: MILLIE
D: Scared the fuck out of me...I’m eating breakfast and next thing I know I’m in the water...
C: JOANNA
D: Come lay down...
N: She helps Millie up and taking her down below...
C: CODY
D: Jesus, I’m so glad you came along...this coast...I guess you can go a long time without seeing anybody else...
N: Mackensie doesn’t say anything.
C: CODY
D: We should have never done this...
E: CONT’D rueful
N: He sees...
C: CODY
D: I don’t know why, I managed to grab my backpack... Americans too?
E: CONT’D calming
C: MACKENSIE
D: We’re on a holiday...
E: nods
C: CODY
D: I’m sorry we got in the way...
N: Mackensie nods...there’s something that isn’t sitting well with him...some instinct...
C: CODY
D: The next village is just about five miles from here...if you didn’t mind us spending the night...and drop us off tomorrow?
E: CONT’D after a beat
C: MACKENSIE
D: Of course...
C: CODY
D: I should check on her...I’m Cody...
E: gets up...grabs his backpack
C: MACKENSIE
D: Russel, Cook...
E: a beat
C: CODY
D: What’s her name?
C: MACKENSIE
D: April.
N: Cody starts to the stairs to go down below...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Hey, could you lower the halyard...?
E: CONT’D off hand
N: Without a moment’s thought Cody lowers the halyard and goes below...
S: EXT. THE SAILBOAT - NIGHT
N: Cody and Millie are sitting with Joanna at the table on the deck having some wine...When Mackensie comes up from below...
C: MACKENSIE
D: You comfortable down there...I left some towels.
C: CODY
D: I can’t thank you enough, you both are so generous...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I didn’t know if you needed this?
N: He gives him his backpack...Cody thanks him...Mackensie sits down with them...pours himself a glass of wine...
C: MILLIE
D: You take things for granted and it can be swept away in an instance...It’s so good to be alive...!
N: They reach in toasting that...When suddenly Mackensie literally HANDCUFFS Cody and Millie’s wrists together! Joanna starts...
C: MACKENSIE
D: They were in their backpack...Along with this...
N: He shows her a familiar STINGER PISTOL PEN.
C: MACKENSIE
D: He said he didn’t know how to sail but he knew right away how to lower a halyard! They’re “London.” You’re good at “drowning.”
E: CONT’D to the Girl
N: Neither of them say anything.
C: MACKENSIE
D: When we were sleeping they would have handcuffed us...taken us up on the deck...
E: CONT’D
N: AND WE SEE JUST THAT, CODY POINTING THE PISTOL, JOANNA AND MACKENSIE, EACH WITH THEIR HANDS CUFFED BEHIND THEM, BEING TAKEN UP ONTO THE DECK...AND WITHOUT A MOMENT’S HESITATION CODY AND MILLIE KICK THEM IN THE BACKS, SHOVING THEM BOTH OVER THE RAIL AND INTO THE WATER...
S: INT./EXT. THE WATER - NIGHT
N: THEY HIT THE WATER...GOING IMMEDIATELY UNDER...HANDS HANDCUFFED BEHIND THEM, FRANTICALLY STRUGGLING, UNABLE TO STAY AFLOAT...DROWNING AND FLOATING DOWN INTO THE DARK SEA... THE LAST THING WE SEE IS FROM UNDER THE WATER CODY AND MILLIE’S FACES LOOKING DOWN FROM THE BOAT INTO THEIR WATERY GRAVE...AND RAISING THE SAILS AND EXPERTLY SAILING THE SAILBOAT AWAY...
S: EXT. THE SAILBOAT - NIGHT
N: Cody, despite being handcuffed, and despite his boyish handsomeness, the monster in him comes roaring out, he suddenly violently lurches, trying to get at Mackensie... Mackensie taking the wine bottle and without a moment’s hesitation, hits Cory across the head...knocking him senseless...
S: INT. THE SAILBOAT - NIGHT
N: As we see Mackensie putting Cody and Millie, handcuffed separately now, into a boat closet...Cody, coming around... but before he can say anything Mackensie closes and latches the door on them...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Sleep well...
E: pure him
S: EXT. THE SAILBOAT - NIGHT
N: Mackensie comes back up onto the deck...Joanna, upset, arms protectively folded across her chest, pacing, pacing... Mackensie holds her, comforting her...
C: MACKENSIE
D: We’re going to have company...
E: and knowing
N: He hasn’t finished his thought when there’s suddenly the blinding LIGHT from a very bright torch shone on them...so bright they have to block the light with their hands and can’t see who’s shining the light...There’s an all too familiar VOICE...
C: A MAN’S VOICE
D: I should have known they wouldn’t be smart enough...these young people London sends are fairly useless...
E: OVER
N: And now we see it’s Mr. Lime on a Zodiac raft, with a crewman, in a ship’s uniform, driving the raft...And we can see in the moonlight a sizable BOAT, its running lights on, is bobbing in the mouth of the cove.
C: MR. LIME
D: Permission to come aboard, Captain.
E: his smile, showing his hands, he is unarmed
C: MACKENSIE
D: Help yourself.
E: unsmiling
N: Mr. Lime reaches out for a hand...Mackensie hesitates but oddly respectful gives him his hand helping him onto the sailboat.
C: MR. LIME
D: Where have you put them?
C: MACKENSIE
D: They’re resting.
N: Mr. Lime smiles.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Good to see you again, Archie.
E: CONT’D
C: MR. LIME
D: And you dear boy. Doc, where are your manners?
C: MACKENSIE
D: Joanna, Archie Lime.
C: MR. LIME
D: Good to meet you Ms. Dunlap. I particularly liked “Girl, Alone.”
C: JOANNA
D: That was my first.
E: instinctive
C: MR. LIME
D: The funeral scene when they are burying her in the bronze casket but we know she is quite alive.
N: Joanna’s quiet.
C: MR. LIME
D: I certainly knew what it felt like not to be able to breathe...
E: CONT’D
N: They’re quiet. At loggerheads.
C: MACKENSIE
D: What do you intend to do, Archie?
C: MR. LIME
D: I remember all too well when the shoe was on the other foot...when I had that particular problem with Mrs.
C: Cunningham...When I forgot
D: myself...let myself get wobbly and soft...
N: Mackensie is quiet...
C: MR. LIME
D: How you gave me a day of grace...a head start...it was very sporting of you, Doc...you could have ended things but you let time elapse for both of us...
E: CONT’D
C: MACKENSIE
D: You couldn’t have foreseen the weather making the road impassible...and you seemed to be enjoying your meal with her so...
C: MR. LIME
D: She was particularly charming...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Whatever happened to her, given the second chance she had?
C: MR. LIME
D: I’m afraid Mrs. Cunningham met an unfortunate accident...she somehow left a train while it was moving...
E: a beat
N: Joanna’s chilled, still...
C: MR. LIME
D: I’m sure we see things quite similarly, Doc...we have committed to doing what we do best...and no matter, what may come, finishing what we started...
E: CONT’D
N: Joanna looks at Mackensie...He doesn’t say anything...
C: MR. LIME
D: Before this gets ugly, please, make your way...You have a day ahead of me...use it well...Then, we will be... “Even Steven...”
E: CONT’D gracious and even it sounds malevolent
S: EXT. THE SAILBOAT - NIGHT
N: Mackensie and Joanna are in the DINGHY, pushing off...
C: MR. LIME
D: The next village is just two coves away...You should be there in no time...
N: Mackensie looks at him, and starts to row them away...
C: MR. LIME
D: I understand there is a lovely little restaurant there that serves freshly grown artichokes in a wine and garlic butter...
E: CONT’D
N: Mackensie rowing them away from the boat...And Joanna’s watch “Bings.”
C: MR. LIME
D: Two weeks, exactly fourteen days...
E: CONT’D well aware...
N: And Mackensie rows them further away...Mr. Lime standing on their sailboat deck watching them go...calling out to them...
C: MR. LIME
D: Bon Voyage!
E: CONT’D
S: EXT. THE SEA - NIGHT
N: Their dinghy at a distance now...Mackensie rowing...they can see Mr. Lime climbing back onto the Zodiac...the raft motoring back toward the large Boat at the mouth of the cove...when suddenly the sailboat bursts into flame, the sailboat on fire...Mr. Lime having started the boat ablaze... and we can either be macabre and see the Young Man and his partner trapped in the closet and see the horrible fate that awaits them...or we can just as well watch from Mackensie’s and Joanna’s point of view the sailboat in the dark on the water engulfed by the conflagration and leave to the imagination what awaits them...Mr. Lime on the Zodiac on his way back to the waiting boat...and Mackensie rowing them further and further away in the light of a Mediterranean moon. And as if it’s an old movie from the twenties, nineteen twenties that is, we CLOSE THE CAMERA IRIS the way they did to show the end of a particular chapter...our iris closing on their rowboat, the sailboat on fire, and the moon. THE CAMERA’S IRIS OPENS AS WE SEE A YOUNG BOY, NO MORE THAN NINE, RUNNING UP A STEEP NARROW COBBLED STREET THAT’S FLANKED BY ANCIENT STONE BUILDINGS...AS HE RUNS UP THE OLD STREET... RUNNING FOR ALL HIS MIGHT...JOANNA’S WATCH “BINGS...”
C: JOANNA’S VOICE
D: Thirteen days left... Twelve days... Eleven days Ten days left...
E: OVER and “Bings” again and again and finally, “Bing,”
N: When the little Boy comes to a gate at a forlorn looking old stone house with a rocky front yard...HE RINGS A BELL... Some moments and a Woman in a full hijab, a black burka, and a niqab covering all but her eyes comes to open the gate. The Boy follows her into the old stone house. And we stop to see just where we are from the top of the hill...Overlooking the Mount of Olives, the Dome of the Rock with its Golden Dome, the Tower of David, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre...It could only be... “Jerusalem.”
S: INT. OLD STONE HOUSE, EAST JERUSALEM - DAY
N: The Woman says something to the Boy in Arabic along with giving him a list...
C: THE WOMAN
D: Don’t forget the eggs this time...
E: Arabic, subtitles
N: He nods yes and immediately goes running back out...A moment and Mackensie comes down the stairs...the Woman in the full burka pulls back her head covering...and we see it’s Joanna. Looking around we see they have been here for some time without leaving...dirty dishes in the sink and the most recent ones still on the table...the trash all but filled... everything we can see is well lived in...her computer on a table in the living room open to a new chapter in her book she is writing...As she looks out the window watching the Boy running back down the narrow street:
S: EXT. A LONDON SUBURB - NIGHT
N: A neighborhood of small well-kept “Victorian” style cottages one after the other the very same.
S: INT. A SUBURBAN COTTAGE - NIGHT
N: A WOMAN in her late sixties trying to stay younger than she is, but despite her imagined blonde hair, a rouge or three, she is fighting a losing battle and she knows it, and fighting the fight is drinking her third daily wine...And now we see Mr. Lime, some years younger than her, still quite in love with her, busy cooking an elaborate meal featuring veal...
C: MR. LIME
D: What temperature would you like it, Mommy? They say just into well done but still in its juice has the most taste.
E: and he calls her, always has...
C: MR. LIME’S WIFE
D: I’ll trust you Daddy.
N: When the doorbell RINGS.
C: MR. LIME
D: Stay put, sweetheart.
N: He goes to see who it is. Opening the door, a very plain man trying to look comfortable in outdoor wear is there...A car idling at the curb with a Woman and a Boy and Girl inside...
C: MR. LIME
D: Oh look, it’s Henry dear.
E: CONT’D
C: HENRY
D: Hello, Celia...
C: CELIA
D: Do you have time for a wine? We can start a fresh bottle.
E: any excuse
C: HENRY
D: We’re on our way to Potato’s cello recital.
C: CELIA
D: How lovely.
C: HENRY
D: Those friends seemed to have gone and disappeared...not a sight of them neither hide nor hare...
E: to Mr. Lime, his purpose, sotto voce... MORE
C: HENRY
D: they seem to have learned how to avoid the many eyes...they were last seen on a ferry to Cyprus...
E: CONT'D
C: MR. LIME
D: They’ll turn up in due time...
E: nods, not worried, sure
C: HENRY
D: What is it, ten days left...?
C: MR. LIME
D: Almost nine to be precise... Give little Potato my best wishes...and tell her when playing doubles to remember to play ponticello...
E: looking unconcerned
C: HENRY
D: I will...Have a good evening...
N: And he turns going back down the path to his car...Mr. Lime going back inside...
C: MR. LIME
D: How would music suit, darling?
C: CELIA
D: That would be lovely.
N: He turns on the radio, something forgettable...and as he goes back to his cooking a doting husband and kindly family man, a killer by any other name...
S: EXT. THEIR HOUSE ON THE HILL OVERLOOKING JERUSALEM -
N: NIGHTFALL The old stone house...And minarets around Jerusalem start calling the faithful to evening prayer.
S: INT. THEIR JERUSALEM HOUSE - NIGHTFALL
N: Joanna busy writing on her computer...Mackensie looking outside...
C: MACKENSIE
D: You want to get some air?
N: She nods, getting up. Fixing her hijab they go outside.
S: EXT. JERUSALEM HOUSE - NIGHTFALL
N: The sounds of the muezzins calling...They cross the rocky yard to an old stone minaret that’s on their property...
S: INT. MINARET - NIGHTFALL
N: They climb the narrow stairs to the top...coming out onto a platform...they stop to look out over Jerusalem. The Muezzins talking to one another...She studies him...
C: JOANNA
D: Even if we can beat the clock...get away...you are still going to finish your job, aren’t you?
E: knowing
C: MACKENSIE
D: Why do you say that?
C: JOANNA
D: He threw the woman off a train, rather than change his life.
C: MACKENSIE
D: What else can I do to show you how I love you? I can’t imagine what it would be like without you.
N: She looks at him, unable to give herself completely to him...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Why can’t you take me for who I am?
E: CONT’D
C: JOANNA
D: Because I don’t know who you are. I can only take you for who you appear to be.
C: MACKENSIE
D: There is nothing I can do to convince you.
C: JOANNA
D: Time will tell.
E: simply
N: And chilled by the coming of the night air she cradles her arms across her chest. When their Muezzin sounds playing from a loudspeaker above them on the Minaret, answering the other calls to prayer...The sound among all the unseen others echoing across Jerusalem. And they hear VOICES from a yard of a house a half block away from them. And when the Muezzin’s calls have stopped they can see an Arab wedding ceremony is beginning in the yard of the nearby house. They watch the unheard ceremony.
C: JOANNA
D: Each of the times I got married I thought it was forever.
E: CONT’D ruminating
C: MACKENSIE
D: You’re supposed to feel that way. Why get married otherwise?
C: JOANNA
D: You were so devoted to her? I only felt devotion the one time to the wrong man. It’s a hard price to pay.
C: MACKENSIE
D: She was always there for me.
C: JOANNA
D: Were you always there for her?
N: He shakes “no.”
C: MACKENSIE
D: I was always trying to find myself.
N: He starts to say something, but stops...
C: JOANNA
D: You found yourself doing this, didn’t you?
E: intuitive
C: MACKENSIE
D: It gave me a purpose.
E: honest
N: He shrugs.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I could be anyone I wanted to be... a surgeon or a pilot or a gambler or a boxer...but I always knew who I was.
E: CONT’D
C: JOANNA
D: That isn’t exactly encouraging...
N: He looks at her...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Maybe other things are becoming more important...?
C: JOANNA
D: I would like to believe that...
E: quiet
N: When there is the sudden sound of MUSIC...a band is playing at the wedding...people enjoying dancing...
C: JOANNA
D: I never danced at a wedding...even my own...I was always the girl with two left feet...
E: CONT’D smiles...
N: They watch the people down in the yard of the house dancing a traditional dance...He purposefully starts down the steps of the minaret...without looking back, expecting her to follow:
C: JOANNA
D: Where are we going?
E: CONT’D
S: EXT. THE EAST JERUSALEM STREET - NIGHTFALL
N: And we see Mackensie, despite her protestations, hidden in her burka, hurrying Joanna along the street...They come to the wedding house...people overflowing standing around outside the house in the street drinking and celebrating... people coming and going...and without letting her have a moment to flee he takes her into the house...
S: INT. EAST JERUSALEM ARAB HOME - NIGHTFALL
N: It’s filled with people, nobody paying any attention to them, just more guests...He takes her outside to the back of the house...
S: EXT. THE EAST JERUSALEM ARAB HOME - NIGHTFALL
N: Lights have come on...the people pressed together happily dancing to the band...And Mackensie takes her by the arm laughing, dancing with her like the others in some wild abandonment...she resists at first but throwing caution to the wind joins in, kicking up her legs like the rest of them...both of them laughing and dancing, cathartic...when the music takes a turn, and it becomes a sweet reverie... modern music...people dancing together...And her watch, if they have forgotten, “Bing...”
C: JOANNA
D: Nine days...
N: Mackensie and Joanna look at each other and familiarly, even intimately smile all they have shared...and coming together, Mackensie holds her...dancing with her to the Beatles in Arabic, “The Long and Winding Road...” And they kiss...as best as I can tell you how much they truly care about each other...if even only for now...WHEN SUDDENLY A DRUNK MAN COMES CAREENING INTO THEM, KNOCKING THEM OVER...JOANNA GOING DOWN HARD...MACKENSIE UNABLE TO BREAK HER FALL...HER ARM TAKING THE BRUNT OF THE FORCE...Joanna, in great pain...He immediately grabs her up...He runs her back through the house...out onto the street...He sees a waiting taxi...runs her to the cab...putting her inside...getting in with her... and as they race off...
S: INT. AN ARAB HOSPITAL - NIGHT
N: Mackensie in the waiting room of a busy hospital waiting for word on Joanna. While a WOMAN in her forties, well kept, but not rich, waiting for someone, sits some chairs across from him...Mackensie’s aware she has been looking at him, carefully...
C: THE WOMAN
D: I know you from somewhere?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’m sorry?
C: THE WOMAN
D: I recognize you. I can’t put my finger on where I know you from?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I don’t think so. I have one of those familiar faces.
N: He turns to disengage.
C: THE WOMAN
D: The church. At the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona.
E: realizes
C: MACKENSIE
D: Excuse me?
C: THE WOMAN
D: You were sitting by my husband in a pew in the church. You must have been the last person to see him alive.
N: He computes this very quickly and his response is...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I was there...There was a man I spoke to briefly...Something happened to him?
C: THE WOMAN
D: He was resting from our tour. He was dying of cancer. Unfortunately his heart gave out there.
C: MACKENSIE
D: How dreadful. I’m so sorry.
C: THE WOMAN
D: It was quick they say and peaceful. Do you remember what you talked about? You were his last conversation.
E: needing the connection
C: MACKENSIE
D: We didn’t talk much...I remember he looked up and told me...
N: THE MAN SITTING WITH MACKENSIE IN THE CHURCH...
C: THE MAN
D: The church will never be finished...They will always keep building until it reaches God.
N: As they look up at the ceiling building its way to heaven...
S: INT. THE HOSPITAL, ISRAEL - NIGHT
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’m sorry about his dying. He seemed like a gentle man.
C: THE WOMAN
D: I’m Carol Watson, I’m from Buffalo...My close friend Andy is being seen to, we’re on a Holy Land tour...He is a homicide detective there. He’s a diabetic. He forgot to bring enough insulin.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I hope things get better.
E: a beat, and generously, fictionally MORE
C: MACKENSIE
D: I forgot...but he did say he was married and what a lucky man he was to have you.
E: CONT'D
N: She’s terribly moved by that. And having told her that, and not wanting it to go any further, he nods and goes to find another seat. And just then Joanna...in a wheel chair, wearing her burka, is being wheeled out with her arm in a sling and a cast...
C: JOANNA
D: I broke my arm...I told you, never dance with me, I have two left feet...
N: He looks at her sympathetically...
C: MACKENSIE
D: We’re too public...
E: very aware, quietly
N: He wheels her out of the hospital...
S: EXT. THE HOSPITAL, ISRAEL - NIGHT
N: They wait for a Cab. When suddenly the Woman comes hurrying out, taking his PICTURE on her phone. He moves away but too late...
C: CAROL WATSON
D: I’m sorry to trouble you...you seem to have enough troubles. Your friend...
E: to Joanna
C: JOANNA
D: My brother...
E: smart
C: CAROL WATSON
D: He was the last person my husband saw... I want to remember you...You’re my only connection left to him...Could I see you again?
E: to Mackensie, meaning the photograph
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’m leaving tomorrow...My sister teaches at an Arab school here...
E: thinking quickly
N: And a husky Man in his late forties, uncomfortable in casual clothing, comes beside her...showing her he’s gotten his insulin supplies...
C: CAROL WATSON
D: This is my friend Andy. This man was with Gregory at the very end.
C: ANDY
D: Good to meet you.
N: Mackensie nods. A Taxi arrives...He helps Joanna inside...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Good luck with everything...
E: to Carol, meaning her life
S: INT. THE TAXI - DAY
N: Driving away...
C: MACKENSIE
D: She was a client’s wife...I gave her husband some peace in the church in Barcelona...
N: Joanna is quiet, and as she looks back at the woman...
C: JOANNA
D: Peace?
E: quietly says, questioning, always questioning
N: ...Wondering what “peace” looks like... WHEN WE SEE A FACEBOOK PAGE...”IN MEMORY.” A PAGE DEVOTED TO GREGORY WATSON, THE MAN WHO MET HIS MAKER AT THE CHURCH. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIS FULL LIFE...FAMILY, WORK AND LOVE...AND A NEWLY TAKEN PHOTOGRAPH OF MACKENSIE, CAPTIONED, “JERUSALEM,” and...”The last person to talk with Gregory on his way to heaven.”
S: INT. AIRPLANE - DAY
N: And WE SEE Mr. Lime is looking at Carol’s FACEBOOK PAGE with Mackensie’s photograph on an IPAD. And we see he’s in First Class on a crowded plane, a number of men wearing yarmulkes, on its way to Israel. As a Flight Attendant brings him a meal...
C: THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
D: You ordered the special meal...
N: He nods...and as he puts a napkin on his lap, settling into what he enjoys most, to eat...
S: INT. THEIR STONE HOUSE IN JERUSALEM - DAY
N: Joanna, in some pain, is sitting on a couch. Mackensie quietly looking out the window.
C: MACKENSIE
D: We need to leave. That woman, that photograph, worries me.
E: urgent
N: And as if to add to their dilemma...her watch, “Bing...”
C: JOANNA
D: Eight days...
E: concerned
N: And just then the BELL sounds from the gate. Mackensie motions her to stay there...he looks outside...the little Arab Boy at the gate...
S: EXT. THE WAILING WALL, THE OLD CITY, JERUSALEM - DAY
N: Carol and Andy along with her tour group at the Wailing Wall...people praying leaving their most heartfelt prayers in notes they put into the chinks in the ancient temple wall...
C: A MAN’S VOICE
D: Mrs. Watson.
E: OVER
N: She turns...and we see Mr. Lime, wearing a yarmulke, coming to her. He shows her an alleged identification in his wallet.
C: MR. LIME
D: Alan Franklin, American Embassy... Security...
N: And he’s flattened his accent to sound completely American.
C: MR. LIME

C: MR. LIME
D: Embassy business.

D: recognized him from the Church where my husband died.
C: MR. LIME
D: Did he say where he was staying?
E: most interested
C: CAROL WATSON
D: No, just that he was leaving...He was very kind to my late husband. I don’t even know his name.
E: realizing
C: MR. LIME
D: He calls himself Mackensie. He is wanted for murder.

D: Murder?
E: blanches...
S: EXT. AN ARAB COFFEE AND HOOKAH SHOP, OLD CITY - DAY
N: Mr. Lime having some bitter coffee sitting with Carol at a small round table among a number of tables on a narrow street in the Old City. Andy, ever present for her, sits nearby... Mr. Lime is telling her...
C: MR. LIME
D: He works for an organization that gives people an opportunity to end their lives painfully and peacefully.
C: CAROL WATSON
D: Something like that exists?
E: struck
C: MR. LIME
D: Yes, it most certainly exists. I think anything you want badly enough and can afford nowadays, exists.
C: CAROL WATSON
D: My husband promised me he wouldn’t suffer...Now I know what he meant...
E: digesting it, upset
C: MR. LIME
D: Mackensie is, despite the appearance of being a merciful man, a stone killer. We got a notice from Interpol he was seen here and to bring him in. You have no idea where he or his “sister” might be?
N: She shakes no. He nods. He’s gotten all she has to give...
C: MR. LIME
D: You’ve been very helpful. Enjoy your stay.
E: CONT’D finishes coffee, getting up and pure Lime, morose
N: And with that, and without looking back, he leaves...
S: INT. THEIR STONE HOUSE, EAST JERUSALEM - DAY
N: Mackensie is hanging up the phone.

D: ...9:49 P.M., two passengers...a man and an injured women to Makassed Hospital on Mount of Olives.
E: reads...
S: INT. THEIR STONE HOUSE, EAST JERUSALEM - LATE IN THE DAY
N: Mackensie and Joanna finishing packing, getting ready to go...When the Muezzin starts its call echoing through Jerusalem...
S: EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE WEDDING HOUSE, EAST JERUSALEM -
N: LATE IN THE DAY The eternal muezzin calling out across Jerusalem...And we see Mr. Lime, along with a thin Man in a yarmulke, coming outside of the wedding house...
C: THE MAN
D: She said someone got hurt dancing...they didn’t know them...
N: Mr. Lime, as the muezzin calls, stops to stand in the street looking at the houses around them, sensing they’re near...
S: INT. THEIR STONE HOUSE, EAST JERUSALEM - LATE IN THE DAY
N: Mackensie hanging up the phone.
C: MACKENSIE
D: It’s on the way...
N: And if Mackensie had bothered to look up we can just see Mr. Lime standing on the street outside of the wedding house a few houses away below them...
S: EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE WEDDING HOUSE, EAST JERUSALEM -
N: LATE IN THE DAY The muezzin still calling...Mr. Lime is about to leave, starting to go back to a car the Israeli Man is getting in to drive them...When he sees THE LITTLE BOY with their bag of groceries running up the street...Lime, quickly reasoning...
C: MR. LIME
D: Stop him!
E: to the Israeli man, motioning...
N: The Israeli Man goes running after the Boy...and before he can reach their stone house, just a bit further up the hill, the Israeli Man pulls him up. Mr. Lime comes to meet them.
C: MR. LIME
D: Ask him who the groceries are for, where is he going...?
E: CONT’D
N: The Israeli Man asks the Boy in Arabic. The Boy, fearful, answers him.
C: THE ISRAELI MAN
D: He said a couple in that house...
N: He motions at their house.
C: MR. LIME
D: Tell him not to say anything...or you will kill his father.
E: a beat
N: The Israeli Man tells him what he was told and the Boy runs off with the groceries to bring to them. Mr. Lime looks around him. The muezzin still SOUNDING. And we see a Taxi coming by them, going to their house.
S: INT. THEIR STONE HOUSE - LATE IN THE DAY
N: The sound of the BELL, Mackensie seeing the little Boy leaving the grocery bag at the door and racing back off...And seeing the Taxi has arrived...
C: MACKENSIE
D: It’s here...
N: He takes up their bags...and with Joanna in her burka, start out of the house, met by the blast of the urgent SOUND of the muezzin calling.
S: EXT. A MINARET, EAST JERUSALEM - LATE IN THE DAY
N: Where we see Mr. Lime and the Israeli Man have come out onto the balcony of a nearby Minaret. The Israeli Man is busy sighting a SNIPER RIFLE, looking down at the yard of their house. We see them come out the door.
S: EXT. THEIR STONE HOUSE, OVERLOOKING JERUSALEM - END OF DAY
N: The Taxi waiting...Joanna and Mackensie coming across the yard...
S: EXT. THE MINARET - END OF THE DAY
N: He has Joanna in his sights...Mackensie right beside her...He starts to squeeze the trigger to put an end to all of this...
S: EXT. THEIR YARD, EAST JERUSALEM - END OF DAY
N: Joanna and Mackensie a moment from their fate...when the MUEZZIN, FINISHED WITH ITS CALL, goes DEAD SILENT...Mackensie instinctively looks toward the Minaret and sees the Israeli Man with the rifle...Mackensie immediately tackles Joanna down just as the bullet intended for her screams by...He drags her instantly behind the heavy gate...bullets riddling the gate...Mackensie manages to open the gate and pulls her, bullets skipping in the street, into the back of the Taxi...
S: EXT./INT. TAXI, STREET, EAST JERUSALEM - END OF DAY
N: The Taxi driver has fled, the Taxi idling...Mackensie pushes Joanna down onto the floor, and crawls into the front seat... sitting below the window he throws the car into gear and pushes the accelerator with his hand...the Cab racing blindly forward...bullets blowing out the windows...the Taxi running over a curb, scraping across a wall...and racing down the hill while bullets chase them...Mackensie scrambles to sit up, and taking the wheel, driving, careens down the street...
S: EXT. THE MINARET, EAST JERUSALEM - END OF DAY
N: The Israeli Man comes running out, getting into his car...Mr. Lime coming out shortly behind him...the car reaching him... Mr. Lime getting in...and as they pursue the wayward Taxi...
S: EXT. THE WALLS OF THE OLD CITY OF JERUSALEM - END OF DAY
N: The sun in its last gasps umber on the Holy City. They reach the walls of the thousands of years Old City...the entrances barricaded against cars...He abruptly stops the car... reaching to help her out...He helps her to run toward the Old City...running by some Israeli Soldiers down the way patrolling with their Uzis...Running with her through a gate into the Old Holy City. When we see not far behind them the Israeli Man and Mr. Lime quickly getting out of their car... The Israeli Man hurrying over to hurriedly talk, gesticulating, to the ISRAELI SOLDIERS...Who, quick to react, along with the Israeli Man, go running into the Old City after them...Mr. Lime, not one to run, it isn’t dignified, and knowing the race goes not to the swift but the steady... goes methodically through the gate after them...
S: INT. THE OLD CITY, JERUSALEM - END OF DAY
N: The last of the light burnishes the narrow cobbled streets and the stone walls. Mackensie and Joanna running through the crowded souks, and bazaars, the Arab and Israeli markets, some in ancient tunnels, others on the narrow stone streets. Mackensie holding her good arm, moving her through the chaos of the ancient city. Running through the incongruous ancient markets, our assassin and his unlikely soulmate trying to dash for freedom. The Soldiers, along with the Israeli Man gaining on them...racing after them through the endless marketplace. And some distance behind them, Mr. Lime, steadily making his way... Mackensie and Joanna reach another gate, running back out of the city...The Soldiers and the Israeli Man now shortly behind them...He blindly runs Joanna up some stairs crowded with Arabs going somewhere...The Israeli Police and the Israeli Man just behind them...
S: EXT. DOME OF THE ROCK - LAST OF THE DAY
N: They come out onto an open stone plaza as large as three football fields spread out before the eternal golden dome of the Arab MOSQUE, the Dome of the Rock. And as far as the eye can see are the prone figures of fervent Muslims, maybe five thousand people in neat rows, all on their hands and knees in supplication, bowing and raising their heads on prayer mats, in prayer. The Soldiers and the Israeli Man nearly upon them; Mackensie takes Joanna, moving her into the mass of the endless penitents...The Soldiers must stop, not allowed to go into this holy place...And when we look again we’ve lost sight of them, Mackensie and Joanna having disappeared somewhere amongst the ardent followers...Mr. Lime arrives. He stops looking out at the sea of thousands in prayer; and among them, I would say infidels, but more appropriately strangers, welcome in this place of God. And as the sun, if on cue, goes down for the day, the last gasp of its light... WHEN WE SEE FROM HIGH ABOVE, FROM A CEILING’S VANTAGE POINT, MACKENSIE AND JOANNA GOING THROUGH A CROWDED SECURITY LINE AT AN AIRPORT.
S: INT. BEN GURION AIRPORT, TEL AVIV - NIGHT
N: Mackensie and Joanna making their way in the SECURITY LINE...When we see the familiar appearance of the indomitable Mr. Lime coming into the line not far behind them...Mackensie instinctively turns and sees him...Mr. Lime, without any concern for others in line, making his way toward them... Mackensie and Joanna moving quickly through the metal detectors...Mackensie is stopped, made to go back...Mr. Lime coming for them...going into his pocket, taking out his pen...Mackensie goes back through the metal detector... stopped again...this time taken aside to be patted and frisked...All the while Mr. Lime, his pen in hand, is almost to them...when Joanna, needing to stop him, suddenly starts to scream...
C: JOANNA
D: He’s got a gun...!!
E: pointing at Mr. Lime
N: And it becomes complete chaos, many ducking for cover, others running...Soldiers plowing into the fray...to encircle Mr. Lime...while Mackensie and Joanna in the chaos, run through security and up an escalator...
C: MR. LIME
D: It’s just a pen...
E: holding it up, showing them
N: He clicks it to show it is harmless...And if they need more proof, he writes on his notepad, tearing it off...showing them, it’s only a pen, having written, smartly, “Shalom.” (Peace.)
S: INT. TERMINAL, BEN GURION AIRPORT - NIGHT
N: Mackensie and Joanna running through the terminal to the gate...the plane has all but boarded...they show their boarding passes and run down the ramp for the plane...Mr. Lime, nearing the gate, steadily coming after them...They go onto the plane...Mr. Lime reaches the gate just as the door to the plane is being closed after them...He goes down the ramp...
C: A GATE AGENT
D: I’m afraid the door’s closed...
N: He shows her a boarding pass...
C: A GATE AGENT
D: Once it’s closed, it’s closed.
E: CONT’D
N: He’s still...
S: INT. THE AIRPLANE - NIGHT
N: Mackensie and Joanna settled into their seats. Mackensie looks out the window. The Plane starting to taxi away. He can see standing at the terminal window looking out at the plane is Mr. Lime.
S: INT. TERMINAL, BEN GURION - NIGHT
N: Mr. Lime looking out the window at the airplane at Mackensie in the plane’s window.
S: INT. THE AIRPLANE - NIGHT
N: Mackensie, as the plane moves away, looking at Mr. Lime in the terminal window. And Mr. Lime, never one to be daunted, does just what Mr. Lime would do, waves a small, almost dear, “goodbye,” as in “not for long.” When we hear the familiar, “Bing.”
C: JOANNA
D: One week. Seven days.
N: WHEN WE SEE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PEACEFUL STREAMS RUNNING THROUGH GREEN HILLSIDES. AND WE SEE A CAR COMING ALONG A COUNTRY ROAD. “County Donegal.” “Ireland.”
S: INT. THE CAR - DAY
N: Mackensie driving. Joanna sitting up front with him.
C: JOANNA
D: Why won’t you tell me where we are going and why? I never wanted to come to Ireland ever again. I hired you to kill me so I wouldn’t have to even think about it. This is cruel.
C: MACKENSIE
D: You will thank me.
N: She’s quiet. They turn off onto a smaller country road, that goes into the hills. Sheep become plentiful. Small sheep farms, and traditional Irish cottages.
C: JOANNA
D: He spoke Gaelic.
E: remembering
N: She says something in Gaelic.
C: JOANNA
D: “I love you, not for never, but forever.”
E: CONT’D
N: She starts to cry.
C: JOANNA
D: Why didn’t you do what you were paid to do? You have made it all come back. I can’t bear it. I can’t live with it.
E: CONT’D
N: He doesn’t say anything. They come to a dirt road that goes down onto a sheep farm. He parks the car on a hillside above the farm. He gets out. She hesitates and gets out.
S: EXT. IRISH COUNTRYSIDE, SHEEP FARM - DAY
N: Sheep fill the top of the hill...dogs barking and a shepherd tending them. There’s the sound of VOICES down at the small farmhouse. And they can see a WOMAN, buttoning a coat, coming out...and after a moment a MAN in his late thirties wearing a peacoat and a flat Irish cap comes out behind her. He looks like what he is, a playwright.
C: JOANNA
D: It’s him. Danny boy. Why did you do this to me?
E: stops
N: He’s quiet. They watch the Irish Playwright walking up the road with his wife. They stop at where their road turns off from the country road, standing talking. Some moments and there’s the sound of a Bus. And coming around the bend, stopping at the farmhouse road, is a small school bus. Two children, two Girls, jump out. The Bus driving off. Danny and his wife and his children, very happy to see each other... they go back down the road to their farmhouse, a particularly close knit family, the girls chattering away...then running the rest of the way to the house... Danny and his wife wearing their good feelings about the way things are like clothing, going back to the house...he stops for a moment to kiss her and they follow the girls inside... And they are gone just like that, the only sounds the sheep and the dogs as the shepherd walks the flock further up the hill. Joanna’s still. She looks at him. And she says, truly grateful...
C: JOANNA
D: Thank you...I wouldn’t want him not to have that happiness... He did the right thing.
E: CONT’D and as hard as it is to say...
N: She looks at him. An Irish breeze ruffles at their clothing.
C: JOANNA
D: I love you.
E: CONT’D and she says from the bottom of her heart
C: MACKENSIE
D: Don’t say that.
E: smiles
C: JOANNA
D: I did.
E: her smile
N: She looks at him.
C: JOANNA
D: You keep your promises. Mean it or not. You make me glad to be alive.
E: CONT’D
N: And unsaid is, “what else could anybody want?” And as they stand on the green hillside in “County Donegal.”
S: INT. IRISH HOTEL, GALWAY - NIGHT
N: We see them at the desk checking into a small hotel in the coastal town of Galway. Turning from the desk, starting for the stairs, he stops at a small gift shop.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I need some toothpaste...
N: He goes inside...He gets a toothpaste going to the counter when he sees a rack of paperbacks and a particular book catches his attention. A copy of “Girl, Alone.” Joanna’s first book, which has on the cover a casket in a grave.
S: INT. THEIR HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: We PAN across the book on a nightstand to Joanna and Mackensie making love in the small top floor room where the ceiling angles to meet the floor; and one can see out the window the River Corrib meeting the Atlantic Ocean. When they’ve finished, laying in the dark, Joanna holding him...
C: JOANNA
D: Where do we go from here?
N: And his silence in the dark tells us he doesn’t know...
S: INT. THEIR SMALL ROOM, NIGHT - LATER
N: Joanna is asleep...Mackensie unable to sleep is reading her book...There’s the startling RING of the phone...Joanna awakened...Mackensie grabs it...
C: A WOMAN’S VOICE
D: A Mr. Lime is calling from London.
E: OVER
C: MACKENSIE
D: Tell him I’m not answering.
N: He hangs up.
C: MACKENSIE
D: He found us.
E: CONT’D the obvious
N: She’s quiet, trying to go back to sleep. He goes back to her book, the casket in the grave on the cover. He puts it down, thinking...Something substantial crosses his mind. He takes up the phone.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’d like to make a plane reservation.
E: CONT’D
N: WHEN SUDDENLY WE SEE A PLANE LANDING.
S: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - EVENING
N: We see them getting off of a plane. Where we see a sign on the wall, “WELCOME TO BUFFALO.”
C: JOANNA
D: You still haven’t said yet why we’re coming here?
N: And he still doesn’t. And as they get on the escalator on their way down the street...
S: EXT. A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, BUFFALO, NEW YORK - NIGHT
N: We see a Taxi coming through a neat leafy neighborhood with small but comfortable houses. It comes to a stop in front of a house. They get out...They go to the door...RINGING the BELL. A moment and the door opens. And the widow CAROL WATSON, answers the door, startled to see him and her there. We can see inside the solid looking man ANDY, the Homicide Detective, is sitting at the kitchen table, the two of them having dinner.
S: INT. CAROL WATSON’S HOME - NIGHT
N: We see a portrait photograph of Carol and her late husband Gregory over a mantle. Carol and Andy with Mackensie and Joanna sitting in a plain simply decorated living room. Mackensie is telling them:
C: MACKENSIE
D: She needs to be kept safe for six days.
N: Carol and Andy are both quiet, having heard their story, not knowing what to think.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’m done with this. I’d like to turn myself in. I thought of you.
E: CONT’D
N: Andy is quiet.
C: ANDY
D: I can’t arrest you without someone making a charge, without evidence...It’s more like a book, a murder mystery, a thriller, than having any actuality.
C: MACKENSIE
D: It must seem that way, but it is deadly real. I am sure Mr. Lime is on his way to Buffalo right now. Nobody has ever escaped their contract.
N: Carol looks at the portrait of her and her husband.
C: CAROL WATSON
D: I wouldn’t press charges...you gave him what he wanted...a peaceful ending. I wouldn’t think anybody would...a person’s last wish is sacred...
N: And giving them her answer...getting up...
C: CAROL WATSON
D: I’ll make up your room...
E: CONT’D
S: INT. GUEST ROOM, THE HOUSE IN BUFFALO - NIGHT
N: Joanna, having come from the bathroom, in a nightgown Carol had loaned her, comes back into the room. Mackensie is still dressed...and putting on his coat...he tells her...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’m going...
C: JOANNA
D: What do you mean, you’re going?
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’ve done all I can for you. You will be safe here for the time that’s left. You aren’t safe with me.
N: She moves to stop him...
C: MACKENSIE
D: When the time, the remaining days have come and gone, go somewhere nobody can find you. Not even men.
E: CONT’D and still the hint of menace...
N: He takes her shoulders.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Start over. Be whoever you want to be. What do writers call it, create a pseudonym for yourself, another you who has a rich and full life of romance and adventure. I’m sure you will meet someone who will be good to you. You deserve somebody who is.
E: CONT’D
N: And with that he turns to go...
C: JOANNA
D: Mackensie...
N: And she holds him...
C: MACKENSIE
D: You never know, kid, maybe we’ll run into each other again. That’s what happens with lost souls.
E: like Bogart
N: And turning he goes out the door...
C: MACKENSIE
D: And lock it...
E: CONT’D motioning, protectively
N: And he’s gone...She looks out the window...a Taxi is waiting...she sees Mackensie cross from the house, get into the Taxi...and he’s gone. Her watch goes off, “BING.”
C: JOANNA
D: Five more days.
E: says to herself
S: INT. A BUFFALO CHAIN HOTEL - NIGHT
N: Mackensie, unable to sleep, sitting alone in the sad lounge in a chain hotel’s bar having a drink...thinking about what comes next...He takes the paperback copy of her book out of his coat pocket...He finds his place, near the end, reading...He reads something that has him go back a page and read it again...He stops to think about something...as he sits alone at the bar his reflection in the bar mirror, a man without a home.
S: INT. BUFFALO AIRPORT - MORNING
N: Where we see Mr. Lime getting off of a plane, coming to America. As he starts into the terminal...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Archie.
N: He turns. Mackensie who has been sitting waiting for him, gets up.
C: MACKENSIE
D: It was the only flight from London. Can we talk?
E: CONT’D
C: MR. LIME
D: I’m starving.
E: no surprise
S: INT. A BUFFALO DINER - MORNING
N: A working class diner. Mr. Lime and Mackensie are sitting in a booth. Mr. Lime relishing a plate of three eggs, five pieces of bacon, hash browns, corn bread and soaked in gravy.
C: MR. LIME
D: Americans know the value of a good breakfast.
E: enjoying
N: He looks at him.
C: MACKENSIE
D: She’s where “London” can’t hurt her.
E: after a beat
C: MR. LIME
D: You know that isn’t possible. You didn’t come to see me to talk me out of this. You’ve decided to finish the job yourself as it was meant to be done. I’m sorry it’s come to that, but that’s the right decision.
E: and wise
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’m in love with her.
C: MR. LIME
D: Of course you are. You will be in love with someone else again.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I suppose so. What is this job’s hold on me?
C: MR. LIME
D: People come and go...but the only thing we have is our self respect. I’m sorry it has come to this. You’ve given her the best time of her life.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’ll do it.
E: nods, certain
N: He gets up.
C: MR. LIME
D: Let me know when and where.
N: Mackensie turns to go...
C: MR. LIME
D: It will be the way it’s supposed to be. She won’t know what hit her. She said it herself in her book, “Girl Up A Tree.” “There are many ways to skin a cat.” I see you’re reading her first.
E: CONT’D he smiles his smile ...and noticing
N: And Mackensie remembers he has her paperback book, “Girl Alone,” with the casket on the cover in his pocket. He takes it out, and without any fanfare tosses it in a trash can...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’m done with it...
E: meaning the book, the extended assignment
N: And heads out the door.
S: INT. CAROL’S HOUSE, BUFFALO - MORNING
N: The phone’s RINGING. Carol comes to get it.
C: CAROL WATSON
D: Yes, of course... Joanna...
E: calling
N: Joanna comes to get the phone.
C: CAROL WATSON
D: It’s Mackensie...
E: CONT’D
N: Joanna takes up the phone...Carol goes into the other room...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Can you meet me right away? I really need to say goodbye.
E: OVER
N: He tells her where...
C: JOANNA
D: I’m coming...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Is Andy around?
E: OVER
C: JOANNA
D: Andy?
E: turns
N: And as Andy, putting on his gun, getting ready for work, comes out of the bedroom... WE SUDDENLY SEE THE BREATHTAKING SIGHT OF THE NIAGARA FALLS THUNDERING AS THEY DROP BELOW.
S: EXT. NIAGARA FALLS, EXCURSION BOAT - DAY
N: We see Mackensie and Joanna putting on their bright red rain ponchos as they wait to board the Maid of the Mist Niagara Falls EXCURSION BOAT. Arms protectively across her chest she seems tremendously nervous.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Are you okay?
C: JOANNA
D: I don’t like all the noise and the power of the falls...It scares me to death...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I’ll take care of you...I thought it was a glorious way to end things for us.
C: JOANNA
D: You have a way of putting things.
E: a wan smile
N: He puts his arm around her.
C: MACKENSIE
D: You’re very brave.
C: JOANNA
D: That’s a familiar woman’s refrain. When don’t I have to be brave?
N: The people, all in their red ponchos, start getting onto the boat. As they follow them aboard...
S: EXT. MAID OF THE MIST EXCURSION BOAT, NIAGARA FALLS, BUFFALO -
N: DAY Joanna and Mackensie on the crowded boat of newlyweds celebrating seeing the mighty Falls. Mackensie, his arm around her, the two of them getting wet from the falls’ spray...
C: MACKENSIE
D: We got married here. Took this very boat.
E: above the roar
N: He goes into his pocket. He gives her a child’s girl’s ring.
C: MACKENSIE
D: The next best thing.
E: CONT’D
N: He puts the ring on her finger. Touched, she puts her head on his shoulder. The boat approaches even closer to the falls...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Let’s get a better look.
E: CONT’D
N: They push their way to the back of the boat as it swings around coming precariously close to the falls. Everyone presses forward to the railing to get as close as they can... Mackensie and Joanna at the front of the people at the railing...As the boat swings as close as possible under the roaring falls he grabs her, holding her, romantically kissing her, goodbye...There’s a crush of people where we lose sight of Mackensie and Joanna in all the red ponchos for a brief moment...until out of all the red we hear a SHOUT...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Woman overboard...!!!
E: OVER CONT’D
N: People press close to him...Mackensie searching the water for sight of her...A Deckhand comes running...
C: MACKENSIE
D: She was looking over the railing and she just went in!
E: CONT’D
N: Everybody scrambles to look if they can see her...
C: MACKENSIE
D: For gods sake, do something!
E: CONT’D to the Deckhand
N: But it is obvious there is nothing that can be done...she is gone! Mackensie left to look at the falls and the deep dark water without blinking an eye.
S: EXT. MAID OF THE MIST EXCURSION BOAT, DOCK - LATER IN THE DAY
N: The boat emptied...Mackensie talking to some Policemen.
C: A POLICEMAN
D: There’s a rescue boat searching...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Has anyone ever survived...?
C: A MAN’S VOICE
D: Not in that particular area...
E: OVER
N: And we see it’s ANDY arriving.
C: ANDY
D: My God, what happened?
C: MACKENSIE
D: We were just looking at the falls and she went over. She must have tripped...
C: ANDY
D: I’m sorry but I have to ask. Do you think she wanted to take her life?
E: a beat
C: MACKENSIE
D: God no, nothing like that. She had everything to live for.
S: EXT. MAID OF THE MIST EXCURSION BOAT, DOCK - NIGHTFALL
N: Mackensie coming off the boat. Starting for a line of Taxi Cabs...
C: A MAN’S VOICE
D: Mackensie...
E: OVER
N: He turns...The ever present Mr. Lime is standing there.
C: MR. LIME
D: Easier than you thought?
C: MACKENSIE
D: Easier than I thought. It would be just what she wanted, unexpected and quick and painless.
E: nods
N: He nods.
C: MR. LIME
D: Well done.
N: He starts to walk away.
C: MR. LIME
D: You will let me know if they find her body, won’t you?
E: CONT’D
N: And he walks off. Mackensie stands for a moment in the falling light looking at the falls...looking at the boat... and crosses to get into a Taxi...and he’s driven away. We stay for some more time...the Captain and his Crew closing up the boat, leaving for the night...The lonely boat sitting at the empty dock...When we see a FIGURE coming out of a boat closet in a familiar red rain slicker...and there’s the sound of the distinctive “BING.”
S: EXT. NIAGARA FALLS - MORNING
N: A boggy bay at the bottom in sight of the falls...a figure in their red poncho lying half out of the water in the weeds... And now we see Andy is already there, the very first to arrive...Another Policeman coming along with a FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHER...The Policeman going to examine the body.
C: ANDY
D: You don’t need to. I took care of it. I started a report. Simple drowning.
E: stopping him
N: The Policeman is glad not to have to be bothered. The Photographer taking PHOTOGRAPHS of the body of the well known drowned author Joanna Dunlap. WHEN WE SEE THE RESULTS OF THE PHOTOGRAPH IN A BUFFALO NEWSPAPER: “Author Drowns At Falls.” “Joanna Elizabeth Dunlap, award winning mystery writer, accidentally fell from the Maid of the Mist excursion boat to her death at Niagara Falls...”
S: EXT. BROOKLYN, NEW YORK CEMETERY - END OF THE DAY
N: An old timeless and endless hillside cemetery with the city in the distant background. Where we see Joanna’s casket, reminiscent of her book cover, being lowered into a grave. A small number of people, Manhattan book types, along with Andy and Carol, watching the casket being lowered. And as Mackensie is first to throw dirt on her grave...And while others do...we see at the end of the line the last to dig a shovel of dirt and throw it on her grave, verifying his job is through, is Mr. Lime. As the people get in their cars and leave, Mackensie is last to go. He takes one final look, and crossing to his car leaves...We linger on the gravesite...A BULLDOZER COMES TO PUSH DIRT ON TOP OF THE CASKET...FILLING THE HOLE...When we hear the distinctive “BING” of Joanna’s watch. Which has us
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. JOANNA’S GRAVE - LATE IN THE DAY
N: The buried CASKET. And we further DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - DAY
N: Where we see Joanna is lying in her casket, not advised for the claustrophobic, with an oxygen mask over her nose and mouth and an oxygen tank nearby. Her oxygen mask rising and falling with each breath of life, despite being buried alive.
S: INT. A BROOKLYN RESTAURANT, FUNERAL RECEPTION - NIGHT
N: A memorial reception. Poster boards are displayed around the room with photographs of Joanna’s various book covers with their titles, along with a number of stunning photographs of Joanna...
S: INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT
N: Joanna, literally buried alive, breathing with the oxygen tank...But we can see the oxygen level is falling...
S: INT. THE BROOKLYN FUNERAL RECEPTION FOR JOANNA - NIGHT
N: When we see Mackensie bringing Mr. Lime a plate of food.
C: MR. LIME
D: That’s awfully nice of you.
C: MACKENSIE
D: I thought you might like the chicken...
N: Mr. Lime, never one to pass up a meal, eats his food...
C: MACKENSIE
D: I have a plane to catch.
E: CONT’D
C: MR. LIME
D: I thought I’d stay another day and have a meal at Le Bernadin. I’ve filled my end of the bargain.
E: satisfied
N: Mackensie nods.
C: MACKENSIE
D: We both have.
C: MR. LIME
D: The chicken is quite good. We will probably never see each other again. You are a deserving adversary.
E: appreciating and
N: Mackensie nods his respect... “And you, Mr. Lime.” And as he starts out of the Restaurant...coming by Andy and Carol...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Thank you for everything...
N: He shakes Andy’s hand and embraces Carol...and as he hurries out...
S: INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT
N: Joanna’s rhythmic breathing. But the oxygen supply starting to become exhausted.
S: INT. TAXI, BROOKLYN - NIGHT
N: Mackensie in the back of the cab looking at his watch.
C: MACKENSIE
D: Can you go any quicker?
E: to the Driver, concerned
S: INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT
N: The sound of the oxygen delivery has begun to labor. As Joanna breathes in and out, in and out...
S: INT. TAXI, BROOKLYN - NIGHT
N: The cab turning a corner. When SUDDENLY a car running a light careens into them, sending the Cab skidding across the intersection...Mackensie, despite his seat belt, bounced around. He finds his balance...shaken, he struggles to open the door...he climbs out...
S: EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT
N: He moves along the street as fast as he is able to go...Just ahead is the CEMETERY...
S: INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT
N: The oxygen has dissipated to a hissing sound...Joanna starting to gasp for air...
S: EXT. BROOKLYN CEMETERY - NIGHT
N: Mackensie, in some pain, making his way across the cemetery.
S: INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT
N: The hissing sound of the oxygen suddenly stops. Joanna breathing the last of it...
S: EXT. BROOKLYN CEMETERY, JOANNA’S GRAVESITE - NIGHT
N: Mackensie has managed to make it to her gravesite. He takes up a shovel, starting to dig the fresh dirt...
S: INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT
N: The oxygen tank has gone dead still. Joanna pulls off the oxygen mask gasping for whatever air is trapped in the casket.
S: EXT. BROOKLYN CEMETERY, JOANNA'S GRAVESITE - NIGHT
N: Mackensie digging as fast as he can.
S: INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT
N: She struggles to breathe whatever last bit of air there is...
S: EXT. BROOKLYN CEMETERY, JOANNA'S GRAVESITE - NIGHT
N: His shovel hits the casket...he pushes the dirt away...
S: INT. JOANNA’S CASKET - NIGHT
N: She’s stopped breathing...
S: EXT. BROOKLYN CEMETERY, JOANNA'S GRAVESITE - NIGHT
N: He struggles to open the casket...Joanna lying still...and she suddenly takes in a huge breath of air and comes completely awake, deeply breathing in the saving air... Mackensie grabs her up...pulling her out...kneeling with her, letting her breathe in the precious air...
C: JOANNA
D: What took you so fucking long?
E: finding her breath
C: MACKENSIE
D: Talk about your woman in distress!
E: him, wry
N: And she starts to laugh, cathartic, at the absurdity of it all...Mackensie sharing the cathartic laughter with her...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Shit!
E: CONT’D for everything
N: And they keep laughing, glad to be together, glad to be alive...When they hear a distinctive CLICKING SOUND...And they see Mr. Lime, clicking his deadly pen as he does, has come to the gravesite.
C: MR. LIME
D: I read the same book you did...
E: had realized
N: He takes out an old paperback copy of her book, “Girl Alone.”
C: MR. LIME
D: “He pulled her out of her casket, holding her as she struggled to catch her breath. And she said, ‘What took you so long?’ Which he planned to make up to her in every way he could. He said, ‘You have to make me a promise.’ She looked at his rough face. He said to her, ‘You can never go away again.’ She didn’t say anything...she couldn’t make that promise. No woman could.”
E: CONT’D reading the end
N: He shuts the book. They’re dead quiet. When her watch sounds, “Bing.”
C: JOANNA
D: That’s all of it. You’ve run out of time.
E: to Mr. Lime
C: MR. LIME
D: I’m afraid that’s on London time. We’re on New York time now.
N: He turns the pen into the lethal weapon that it is.
C: MR. LIME
D: You saved me the trouble of having to find someone to bury you two...
E: CONT’D meaning the open grave
N: He points the pistol fingering the small trigger about to kill them...
C: MR. LIME
D: Safe travels...
E: CONT’D
N: When for some reason he loses his footing slightly stumbling...He tries to find his balance...
C: MR. LIME
D: I’ve lost my balance...
E: CONT’D confused by it
N: He goes down on his knees...He doesn’t understand what’s happening to him...
C: MR. LIME
D: What’s happening to me?
E: CONT’D
N: He tries to get back up but his legs won’t support him and he sits heavily back down. He’s not doing well, not doing well at all.
C: MACKENSIE
D: You shouldn’t have eaten the chicken.
E: simply
N: And he tosses him the empty deadly nasal spray bottle...
C: MACKENSIE
D: Archie. Didn’t your mother ever tell you to watch what you eat?
E: CONT’D
N: Mr. Lime seems to want to say something but losing his battle with consciousness pitches over onto his stomach like a beached whale. It’s dead still. They don’t move taking a moment to appreciate the exquisite ending together. And as they silently celebrate, sharing a well earned smile of triumph...
S: EXT. THE BROOKLYN CEMETERY, JOANNA’S GRAVE - NIGHT
N: Mackensie and Joanna finishing putting Mr. Lime into the casket. Closing the lid on him.
S: EXT. THE BROOKLYN CEMETERY, JOANNA’S GRAVE - NIGHT
N: And we see them from a distance walking away from the grave, walking down the hill past the endless grave markers leaving it all behind.
S: EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAYBREAK
N: The glorious Bridge. And we see Joanna and Mackensie walking over the bridge back to the City inexorably together. We linger for a moment on their disappearing into the distance with the wonderful feeling anything is possible. And it seems we should end there...but wait... WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES ON AN AIRPLANE AGAIN.
S: INT. A FLIGHT TO LONDON - NIGHT
N: Joanna settling into her seat. And the first thing we hear is the MAN’S VOICE, self effacing like Cary Grant, that began our journey:
C: THE MAN’S VOICE
D: I think this is my seat.
E: OVER
N: And we see Mackensie with his bags and in his overcoat smiling at her, taking his seat, right back where we metaphorically started. But this time she says...
C: JOANNA
D: I saved it just for you...
E: smiling
N: And so happy to be together...
C: JOANNA
D: We made it.
E: CONT’D joyfully
C: MACKENSIE
D: We did!
E: equally, his smile
S: INT. THE PLANE, NIGHT - LATER
N: Joanna and Mackensie sitting together in the dark plane...
C: MACKENSIE
D: This time we can go anyplace we ever dreamed of. We can take all the time or as little as we want because we have each other.
E: whispering in the dark
C: JOANNA
D: And you can be yourself. No more “London.”
C: MACKENSIE
D: No more “London.”
E: nods yes
N: She puts her head on his shoulder.
C: JOANNA
D: It sounds too good to be true.
N: She starts to close her eyes...
C: JOANNA
D: You gave me the best time of my life.
E: CONT’D
C: MACKENSIE
D: Sweet dreams...
N: She looks at Mackensie once more as if being certain to remember him...She gives him a small last contented smile, and breathing regularly she is safely, peacefully, and blissfully asleep... WHEN DAYLIGHT SUDDENLY POURS IN.
S: INT. THE AIRPLANE - MORNING
N: The plane landed, arriving at the GATE. The familiar chime that it’s safe to get up. Great activity, people gathering their stuff, getting ready to go. Mackensie gets up getting his things, shrugging on his overcoat. Surprisingly, he starts to make his way off the plane for some reason without her...Before he departs he stops and looks back at Joanna. And here you have it. We see she is still lying in her seat with her head just out of the blanket, eyes closed, motionless. Joanna seemingly at peace, having “lived” the life she so badly wanted, filled with romance and adventure. But now may I say, “dead to the world.” Mackensie takes a last look at her, and his work done, gets off. The plane empties. Joanna still hasn’t moved. A Flight Attendant trying to rouse her, to no avail. She goes for help.
S: INT. LONDON HEATHROW - MORNING
N: Mackensie, his job complete, moving through the busy terminal...
S: INT. THE AIRPLANE - MORNING
N: Joanna completely alone, lying in her seat on the empty plane. And just to put a button on things, as ironic as can be, we hear one of the most romantic movie songs ever sung, “Moon River,” playing over...”Moon River, wider than a mile, I’m crossing you in style some day. Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker, wherever you’re going I’m going your way...”
S: INT. LONDON HEATHROW - MORNING
N: The unforgettable Mackensie, accompanied by the song, moving through the terminal. “Two drifters, off to see the world...”
S: INT. THE AIRPLANE - MORNING
N: Joanna, still in her seat. “There’s such a lot of world to see.” Or may I say she is where “being dead” is only another day at the office for “London.” “We’re after the same rainbow’s end...”
S: INT. LONDON HEATHROW - MORNING
N: Mackensie moving off, but before he goes he turns to look back at us. He smiles, shrugs as if to say... “All good things must come to an end.” And as he goes on about his way moving through the terminal...and I have the distinct feeling we haven’t seen the last of him...But for now... “Waiting round the bend...”
S: INT. THE AIRPLANE - MORNING
N: Joanna lying in her seat. “My huckleberry friend...” Her arm almost gracefully falls. Where we can see her watch on her wrist as it goes off for a final time, “Bing.” “Moon River, and me...”
