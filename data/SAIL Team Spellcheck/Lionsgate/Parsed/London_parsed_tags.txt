N: And we see a WOMAN in her late thirties, a modern woman in
N: all the right respects, including combed and tailored, topped
N: by a distinctive red beret, somebody seemingly sure of
N: herself settling into her business class seat. But don’t be
N: misled by her tailoring, her sense of being so put together,
N: she has all the not-so-subtle fidgeting and mannerisms of a
N: charismatic neurotic. Somebody who has embraced her neuroses
N: as to have them become affectations of something she wears as
N: a uniqueness about her, “an artist,” although when stripped
N: naked of her success she is just another neurotic desperate
N: for the peace of control over her universe. But much more
N: about her to come...At this moment she is busily settling
N: into her seat, doing the little things people do to make
N: their seat, like the show “Alone,” building their shelter
N: from the storm, making the seat her sanctuary; putting up the
N: invisible shell from any potential seat-mates, intruders. In
N: short, making it for these next seven hours her home.

N: And like any good Hitchcock, or Billy Wilder movie, the first
N: thing we really hear is a MAN’S VOICE. Sunny, innocent
N: enough, even a little bit fumbling like a Cary Grant, that
N: begins our journey simply with:

C:                     A MAN’S VOICE (OVER)
D:           I think this is my seat.
0: 
N: She blinks away the fantasy that she would have the seat to
N: herself. And we see a MAN in his early forties wearing an
N: overcoat putting his book bag on the aisle seat next to hers.
N: A handsome rough hewn man who doesn’t smile very often, but
N: when he does it is earned and makes us want to know him.
N: Putting his rolling bag up...

D:           Actually, “Doc.” I’m crazy about the
D:           movie “Marathon Man.” I’ve watched it
D:           like a hundred times... I know it
D:           pretty much word for word. Dustin
D:           Hoffman’s brother, played by Roy
D:           Scheider, was CIA, everything was a
D:           secret...I was eleven when I first saw
D:           it and I loved secrets. Still do I
D:           suppose. He was named Doc, it stuck.
D:           The villain was an old Nazi portrayed
D:           by Sir Laurence Olivier...he asks him,
D:           “Well...can I trust you?” Doc says,
D:           ”You never could. You only had to.”
D:           The old Nazi says, “We’re talking
D:           about my safety.” Doc answers him,
D:           “May I be candid?” The old Nazi nods
D:           yes...and Doc says, “I couldn’t give a
D:           fuck about you...!”

D:           I have a place in Woodstock. The only
D:           people I saw were Amazon drivers, my
D:           gardener, pool man and one of my two
D:           children, Iris, waiting to go back to

D:           I took a trip. I bought an RV, an old
D:           Airstream, and traveled from one park
D:           to another for the first six months.
D:           Do you know they have park hosts?
0: 
C:                     JOANNA
D:           I don’t camp much. We went glamping in
D:           the Tetons one time, stayed in yurts
D:           when the kids were small... cots with
D:           pedic mattresses and Sundance
D:           blankets, that’s as close as I get to

D:           The hosts get to live for free and
D:           take care of the campground. They are
D:           a step above homeless. An old rusted
D:           trailer, a dented red ATV and chopped
D:           wood they sell to campers in their
D:           yard. But it’s I suppose as close as
D:           you can get, when penniless, to being
D:           free. I sat one night with the hostess
D:           and her female partner. They seemed as
D:           happy as they could be.
E:               (a beat, without affect)

D:           told him all of my ideas and he was
D:           always the best critic and the most
D:           ardent fan. My muse. We went and saw a
D:           play of his at the four hundred year
D:           old Abbey Theatre in Dublin. He stayed
D:           to say goodbye to the cast...the
D:           theatre by that time had closed...we
D:           were leaving...the stage was empty...

D:           As much for them as for me. I’m not a
D:           love addict. But I believe you can
D:           find somebody who is perfect for you.
D:           Only for you. He was mine. I have had
D:           a very difficult time without him. It
D:           felt like the end of something, a door
D:           closing, forever. That I would never
D:           find somebody I loved and nobody would
D:           love me that way ever again. It got to
D:           the point I was seeing my shrink
D:           daily. I literally couldn’t breathe.
D:           They say time heals all wounds. I gave
D:           it time. But my heart wouldn’t heal.
D:           It crushed me day and night. The most
D:           terrible deep ache. I thought more and

N: We see Mackensie under a hot shower...the steam fogging the
N: glass...And the shower door suddenly opens and Joanna, naked,
N: having plainly made her decision, comes in with him. She
N: stops him from saying anything with a kiss...and as they
N: blindly throw themselves into each other, gratefully holding
N: onto each other as if a port in the storm...and as they
N: ardently make love in the hotel shower...

N: Dressed in her red beret and coat, Joanna comes into the

N: his hands on his thighs like a prizefighter, and he says,
N: forthright...

D:           I have peacefully ended nine other

D:           Your instinct as a human being is if

D:           them up...Unless you are a sociopath,
D:           you have to learn how to swallow your

D:           I don’t know...something about you...I
D:           felt something I hadn’t felt in a long
D:           time. I can’t even describe it. It was
D:           just a feeling. I didn’t want to be
D:           apart from you. I wanted to follow our
D:           story... where do we go, how do we end
D:           up?

N: She’s still, unsure.

D:           You are very good at what you do. In
D:           the most lovely way you gave me the
D:           possibility of intimacy, connection,
D:           romance, and hope. It was what I
D:           needed. And with such skill, you are
D:           very seductive. “Call me Doc.” The
D:           self-conscious inarticulateness, the
D:           stutter. How “you hadn’t felt that way
D:           in a long time.” Your wife, your
D:           “northern star.” Did you even have a
D:           wife?
0: 
N: He doesn’t answer her.

D:           What if you don’t like me? What if you
D:           discover when we’ve run away to
D:           Barcelona or Cape Town or who knows
D:           where that I don’t match up to your

E:               (concerned)
D:           The penalty for not finishing the job
D:           is they send somebody to complete what
D:           you had contracted for, and for me,
D:           now being a liability, end my career.

S: EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

N: Rain falling. And we see they are parked in front of a
N: nondescript brick building with a few windows and a single
N: name over the doorbell, “London.” She looks up very aware of
N: the security camera looking down on her. She buzzes. A moment
N: and the door sounds opening. She looks for a moment back at
N: the Taxi in the rain, Mackensie in the window...She hesitates
N: and goes inside...

N: She climbs up a staircase to a small reception area. Cameras
N: are visible everywhere. Nobody seems to be there, but most
N: immediately a door opens and a YOUNG MAN in an expensive
N: tailored suit answers. Before she can say anything:

C:                     THE TAILORED YOUNG MAN
D:           Ms. Dunlap. Please follow me.
0: 
N: He takes her behind the reception door inside. A hallway with
N: some few doors all of which are closed and always seem to be
N: closed. He takes her to a corner office, knocks once, a VOICE
N: is heard, and he shows her in. Where a tall Man in an
N: unremarkable suit, a man with very little affect, is standing
N: at his desk greeting her without a hint there is a person
N: inside him, metaphorically an invisible man...
0: 
C:                     THE INVISIBLE MAN
D:           So nice to meet you. I’ve read all
D:           your books. “Girl Up A Tree” was my
D:           favorite. The way she got her revenge
D:           with her husband was so deserved, and
D:           felt so real. The way you described
D:           the curved spike of the fire poker
D:           hitting him clean in the forehead...
D:           How you said it made such a little
D:           mark for the force that was applied
D:           and then seemed to open up his
D:           forehead like a puckered fruit.
E:           (marvels at the sound of...) “Puckered
D:           fruit.” You do have quite an
D:           imagination, quite a way with words,
E:           Ms. Dunlap. (without a pause) How can
D:           I help you? What seems to be the
D:           problem?
0: 
C:                     JOANNA
D:           I’ve had a change of heart. I want to
D:           cancel my contract.

N: He furrows his brow.

C:                     THE INVISIBLE MAN

C:                     THE INVISIBLE MAN
D:           We understand how upsetting this all
D:           must be. The job wasn’t done well, not
D:           well at all. He was one of our very
D:           best. We can only think he forgot
D:           himself and became somehow personally
D:           involved. I’m afraid we can’t let that
D:           happen. He will have to be removed
D:           from the assignment of course, and we
D:           will fulfill our obligations. I
D:           understand we still have just short of
D:           three weeks...
0: 
C:                     JOANNA

E:               (frowning)
D:           I understand...I assume you are well
D:           aware of the terms of our
D:           contract...Of course once you signed
D:           it, it was may I say, “executed.”
0: 
C:                     JOANNA
D:           I completely understand what I agreed
D:           to...I’m not here about the money, I
D:           want the contract voided...there won’t
D:           be any need for it anymore...
0: 
N: The phone rings. He gets it. He listens. He says...

C:                        THE INVISIBLE MAN
D:           Excellent.
0: 
N: He hangs up.
0: 
C:                     THE INVISIBLE MAN (CONT’D)
D:           That was my manager. He said, despite
D:           our agreement, in this rare instance
D:           we can make the contract null and
E:           void. (personally) He is quite a fan
D:           of yours also and I think he selfishly
D:           wants to read more...
E:               (standing, ending...)
D:           I’m glad we could come to a satisfying
D:           conclusion. These things can become
D:           rather messy. It will be taken care
D:           of, removed from the books...thank you
D:           for coming...

N: after her. She moves back along the closed doors hallway,
N: starting for the stairs...when she sees a Security Guard has
N: come to stand by the front door waiting at the bottom of the
N: stairs with an open umbrella for her. He offers her an
N: accommodating hand, even that seeming malevolent...

N: The dark room. Mr. Lime, for some reason takes out a pen,

N: raises the innocuous looking pen and in a motion folds it at
N: an angle to reveal a tiny trigger, turning it into a
N: miniature .22 pistol with the smallest of silencers called a
N: “Stinger Pen,” it defines small but deadly...as deadly as the
N: cattle truncheon the killer, Javier Bardem, carried in “No
N: Country for Old Men.” And without a moment’s hesitation he
N: fires into the bed...the dwarf pistol spitting bullets...the
N: bed, the mattress, in spasms of fire, literally smoldering...
N: But coming closer he sees it’s empty, the vicious tiny and
N: efficient pen gun in hand, standing in the dark room over
N: their empty bed. He hears a car door closing. He goes to the
N: window looking outside. He sees Joanna and Mackensie getting
N: into a Taxi and being driven away. He says to himself the
N: license number...he takes up his phone...texts the taxi
N: number to someone...pushes send...He goes into the living
N: room. He turns the pistol back into a pen putting it neatly
N: back where it belongs in his pocket. He takes up the Hotel
N: phone. And as his dinner was interrupted:

N: The plane landed, arriving at the GATE. The familiar chime
N: that it’s safe to get up. Great activity, people gathering
N: their stuff, getting ready to go. Mackensie gets up getting
N: his things, shrugging on his overcoat. Surprisingly, he
N: starts to make his way off the plane for some reason without
N: her...Before he departs he stops and looks back at Joanna.
N: And here you have it.
0: 
N: We see she is still lying in her seat with her head just out
N: of the blanket, eyes closed, motionless. Joanna seemingly at
N: peace, having “lived” the life she so badly wanted, filled
N: with romance and adventure.

N: But now may I say, “dead to the world.” Mackensie takes a
N: last look at her, and his work done, gets off. The plane

N: Joanna completely alone, lying in her seat on the empty
N: plane. And just to put a button on things, as ironic as can
N: be, we hear one of the most romantic movie songs ever sung,
N: “Moon River,” playing over...”Moon River, wider than a mile,
N: I’m crossing you in style some day. Oh, dream maker, you

N: terminal...and I have the distinct feeling we haven’t seen
N: the last of him...But for now... “Waiting round the bend...”

S: INT. THE AIRPLANE - MORNING

N: wrist as it goes off for a final time, “Bing.” “Moon River,
N: and me...”
