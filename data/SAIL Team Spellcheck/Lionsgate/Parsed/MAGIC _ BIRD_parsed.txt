M: FIRST DRAFT
M: October 1, 2020
T: FADE IN:
N: On the ROAR OF A CROWD. It’s screaming inside --
S: INT. RUPP ARENA - NIGHT
N: Home of the Kentucky Wildcats. A PACKED HOUSE watching a BASKETBALL GAME in full swing. The (predominantly white) USA JUNIOR NATIONAL TEAM running circles around RUSSIA as -- A TITLE CARD READS: WORLD INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY - 1978 The best college players on the planet are in this gym only -- they aren’t on the court. They are riding the bench.
C: MAGIC
D: You believe this shit, man.
N: Seated on the bench, watching the game pass them by, are: LARRY BIRD (21) and EARVIN “MAGIC” JOHNSON (19). Larry, of course, is the tall, white, bowl cut, acne-scarred, porn stashed, backwoods, “Hick from French Lick” and -- Magic, obviously, is the black, 6’9”, megawatt supernova with a Hollywood smile and talent and charisma to burn. Quite a pair. Both disgruntled, unused to riding the pin.
C: MAGIC
D: Every time coach takes us out, these cats start coming back. What the fuck is he doing?
E: CONT’D
C: LARRY
D: He don’t care about us. Just wants to work out his guys. Couldn’t pay me to play for Coach Hall at UK.
C: MAGIC
D: Yeah? What’d he do to you?
C: LARRY
D: Told my high school coach I was too slow to play big time college ball.
C: MAGIC
D: That was four years ago? -- Remind me not to get on your bad side.
C: LARRY
D: I mean just look what he’s running.
N: They watch the game on the court. It’s not quite 1950’s, set- shot, white ball, but it’s not too far off.
C: LARRY
D: He wouldn’t know an ace player if one punched him in the face.
E: CONT’D
N: That gets a laugh out of Magic when --
C: COACH HALL
D: Come on! Bird. Johnson. Get in.
N: COACH JOHN B. HALL (40’s), the asshole is question, waves our two heroes in. Magic turns to Larry at the scorer’s table.
C: MAGIC
D: Wanna show this fool something?
N: Magic flashes a smile as they’re buzzed into the game and what happens next is the stuff of basketball legend. The black and white game suddenly jumps into color. They are on defense at first and when a Russian shot bricks, Larry snags the rebound one handed, firing on an overhand bullet all the way down to court that hits Magic in stride for a break-away dunk that gets the crowd on their feet. Magic’s chance next. He pushes the pace on the break, drawing three defenders at once, tripping all over each other when -- Magic fires a no-look missile to Larry cutting down for a layup that leaves the Ruskie's on skates and -- When they run the break together, it’s lightning in a bottle. Magic drives past three defenders, flying down the left block, dropping a no-look dime over his shoulder to -- Larry, cutting hard down the lane. It’s only on his hands for an instant, drawing the last two defenders before -- He dishes it no-look back to Magic for a wide open lay-up and the CROWD goes berserk. So does Magic. Pure joy. He gives Bird a high-five. A taste of what could have been. But the moment is fleeting and -- A SHORT WHILE LATER It’s over. The US has won. The teams shaking hands as the MEDIA descends, trying to wrangle the stars.
C: REPORTER
D: Hey Magic. Great game. Can you talk for a minute?
C: MAGIC
D: Yeah. Let’s get Larry. Hold on. Where the hell did he go?
E: looking over crowds
N: Because Larry’s already leaving, slipping off the court, out of the glare of the spotlights. Magic can’t comprehend.
C: MAGIC
D: Well, I guess it’s just me.
E: CONT’D
N: Magic turns back to the cameras, lights up his smile as - We end on Larry, dipping out on the celebration, disappearing alone into the dark of tunnel as we --
T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: A TITLE CARD READS: THREE YEARS EARLIER
T: FADE BACK IN ON:
S: EXT. FRENCH LICK STREETS - MORNING
N: A GARBAGE TRUCK rumbling down an impoverished dirt road in a poor, rural farming town of 8,000 people that makes Hoosiers look like it was shot in Manhattan. TITLE CARD READS: FRENCH LICK, INDIANA We follow the truck, rumbling past abandoned farms and two room clapboard houses. A worker hanging on the back. It’s Larry Bird (19), wearing a STREET DEPT. UNIFORM like Martin Sheen in Badlands. When the truck stops at a house -- Larry hops off and heaves trash into the back of the truck with his friend, KEVIN KEARNS (20). Hard, backbreaking work that Larry doesn’t mind. Once they’ve dumped all the cans -- Larry jumps back on as the truck pulls off again and --
S: EXT. OTHER FRENCH LICK STREETS - DAY (VARIOUS SHOTS)
N: Larry and Kearns haul trash through their entire poor, little town until they reach the final house. After the last bag is tossed, Larry spots a CAN on the ground and he shoots it like a three into the back of the truck and -
S: EXT. BARN, FRENCH LICK - AFTERNOON
N: Now that the trash work is done, Larry and Kearn put up BALES OF HAY in a barn. Another back-breaking job that tears your arms up to shreds. Larry puts up a thousand in the heat of the sun and --
S: EXT. STREET DEPT. WAREHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The work day’s finally done. The truck parked in the warehouse, Larry heads out the door.
C: KEARNS
D: Hey Birdie, you want a beer?
N: Kearns hands him a CHAMPAGNE VELVET BEER (Indiana local piss- cheap beer) from the back of his CAR and they cheers.
C: KEARNS
D: You want a ride to your grandma’s?
E: CONT’D
C: LARRY
D: That’s ok, gonna walk. See you later tonight.
C: KEARNS
D: Hope you ain’t too tired to play.
N: Larry flips him the bird, walking off with his beer toward --
S: EXT. LIZZIE KERN’S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: A tiny, though well kept, one-story clapboard house beside a railroad track where -- Larry’s approaching, having walked for a mile. He takes his last sip of beer, tossing it shattering across the tines of tracks and then heads through the door into --
S: INT. LIZZIE KERNS’ HOUSE. THAT MOMENT
N: Larry’s grandmother’s house. His sports trophies everywhere, alongside family photos Larry’s FOUR BROTHERS and SISTER. Larry enters to find his grandmother, LIZZIE KEARNS, opening mail in the kitchen. Lizzie’s 60. Loving. A straight shooter.
C: LIZZIE
D: How was work? You want something for dinner?
C: LIZZIE
D: You want something for dinner?
E: CONT’D
C: LARRY
D: No thanks. Gotta game. Just came by for my things.
C: LIZZIE
D: Know who’s going to be there tonight, don’t ya?
N: She produces a letter. The return address reads: INDIANA STATE UNIVERSITY.
C: LARRY
D: Wonder how he found me?
E: sarcastic
C: LIZZIE
D: Your mother’s just trying to help. I don’t want to get in the middle, but at least talk to her, Larry.
E: cuts him a look
C: LARRY
D: What do you want me to say? I told her before, I ain’t going back to school. I’m too happy right here. That way I get to see you.
N: Larry gives her a kiss, heading into his stark, fastidiously clean bedroom to retrieve his basketball gear when -- He pauses for a moment, noticing a PHOTOGRAPH IN THE ROOM: A buzzed-cut young Larry posing proudly with his father, JOE BIRD. A Johnny Cash look-alike, only taller and tougher. Larry regards it for a moment, until A CAR HONKS outside, breaking his reverie. He heads back out the door.
C: LIZZIE
D: Don’t come home, you don’t win.
N: He laughs as he goes, leaving Lizzie shaking her head and ---
S: INT. MARK’S ‘64 CHEVY - EVENING (A FEW MOMENTS LATER)
N: MARK BIRD (Larry’s brother, 22) is at the wheel while Larry changes into his uniform beside him. Silence. Larry knows.
C: LARRY
D: Don’t start in on me too. You came back home for college, same as me.
C: MARK
D: Yeah, only difference, I finished. I don’t know if you heard, but it takes more than 10 days.
C: LARRY
D: That true? I’ll be damned. Why didn’t somebody tell me?
N: The brothers laugh. Always bullshitting.
C: LARRY
D: ‘Sides, I go back, you won’t have any friends so just shut up and drive. I don’t wanna be late.
E: CONT’D
C: MARK
D: You asked for it. Fine.
N: And Marks steps on the gas, kicking up dirt on the road and --
S: EXT. WEST BADEN HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT
N: Mark’s car finally arrives in a lot packed with pick-ups and Chevy’s for an AAU Game. The biggest show in a small town. Before Mark’s even parked, Larry runs for the doors into -
S: INT. WEST BADEN HIGH SCHOOL GYM - THAT MOMENT
N: A packed gym. Right out of Hoosiers. On court, a local AAU TEAM getting their asses smacked by an INDIANA ALL-STAR TEAM.
C: CROWD
D: Goddamn it! C’mon!
N: The whole town is here. EIGHT HUNDRED WORKING CLASS LOCALS, fed-up with their team. The only hint of outsiders -- TWO SHARP DRESSERS IN SUITS sitting apart in the stands. In a beat, we’ll learn they’re: INDIANA STATE HEAD COACH, BOB KING and more importantly, his assistant, BILL HODGES (35, kind, and plain spoken.)
C: BOB KING
D: This is a waste of my time. Where the hell is this kid?
C: BILL HODGES
D: His mom said he would be here. Just hold on. Here he comes!
N: The whole crowd starts to buzz as Larry enters the gym, hurrying over to his bench and his coach.
C: LARRY
D: Sorry I’m late. Had to wait for a ride.
C: AAU COACH
D: Do you need to warm up or...?
C: LARRY
D: No. I’m ready. Let’s go.
N: Larry heads to the scorers table, wiping the bottom of his shoes with the palms of his hands in a ritual of his.
C: BOB KING
D: That’s your white knight? Kid looks like a scarecrow. No wonder he did not last two weeks with Bob Knight. Can he even get off the floor?
C: BILL HODGES
D: Just wait and you’ll see.
N: He won’t have to wait long, because as soon as Larry checks in the game, King’s skepticism is vanquished. On the very first play, Larry picks the shifty POINT GUARD’S pocket and takes it in for a left handed lay-up. Hodges gives his head coach a look as --
S: OVER THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF QUARTERS:
N: Larry puts on a display that leaves jaws on the floor. He runs power-point, dropping behind the back dimes. He crashes the boards with a stunning sixth sense. He dives after lose balls and shit talks bigger players and -- Of course, Larry drops j’s from such ingenious angles that -- Bob King is left gawking. Watching a savant playing chess when everyone else’s playing checkers. He turns to Hodges.
C: BOB KING
D: Why isn’t this kid in college? We need to get him to Terre Haute.
S: EXT. POOL HALL, WEST BADEN - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Larry and Kearns play pool in a grim little joint that looks out of THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. Mark is there too, all drinking beers, watching Larry line up a tough shot on the eight ball.
C: LARRY
D: I’ll bet you five bucks I’m gonna pocket this.
N: Surprising to no one, Larry’s competitive as all hell.
C: KEARNS
D: Five bucks? Let me see it.
C: LARRY
D: Well, I don’t got it on me. But Shorty still owes me for sweeping last week. Hey Shorty, you got me?
N: Larry calls out to the owner, SHORTY READER (50’s) a little person. Under five feet. A great guy but he shakes his head.
C: KEARNS
D: Bet’s off. There you go.
C: BILL HODGES
D: I can spot you five bucks.
E: O.S.
N: They all turn, surprised, to see Bill Hodges in the door.
C: BILL HODGES
D: You play like you did tonight, don’t see how I could lose. And you weren’t tired, or nothing.
E: CONT’D
C: LARRY
D: Why’d I be tired against them?
C: BILL HODGES
D: Saw those scrapes on your arm. You been putting up hay?
N: Larry looks at his arms, surprised at Hodges’ insight.
C: KEARNS
D: We been at it all day. Put up twelve hundred bales. What do you know about that?
C: BILL HODGES
D: I told Larry before. I grew up in a place just like this. My whole family are farmers.
C: LARRY
D: Yeah, well I thought I told you, you should stop wasting your time. Don’t know what my mom told you, but I’m done playing college ball. You need a player up there, why don’t you talk to Kearns. He’d have been a great player, ever gotten the chance.
C: BILL HODGES
D: They say the same thing about you. I don’t know what happened in Bloomington, son, but Indiana State’s a small school. Only 3000 kids. You’d fit in there just fine. You all three should come up. Play some ball with the team. Take a look at Terre Haute.
E: that slows Larry a bit beat
C: MARK
D: You actually gotta team there? You ever even been to the tournament?
N: Larry and the boys laughs. Hodges takes it in stride.
C: HODGES
D: Not yet, but we will. It just takes the right players. How ‘bout I make you a deal? You hit that shot and I’ll walk out the door. Never see me again. But you miss, you owe me a trip to Terre Haute. What do you think? How’s that sound?
E: of Larry’s reluctance
C: LARRY
D: I never see you again? All right. I’ll take that bet.
E: off Hodges nod
N: Larry picks up the cue and lines up his shot.
C: LARRY
D: Don’t say I didn’t warn you.
E: CONT’D
N: CRACK! Hodges watches crestfallen as Larry pockets the ball.
C: LARRY
D: Least you still got the five bucks.
E: CONT’D
N: Larry and his friends head off laughing when --
C: BILL HODGES
D: Hold on Larry, wait up.
N: Hodges catches him at the door.
C: BILL HODGES
D: I know why you’re scared. I heard what happened with your dad, but --
E: CONT’D
C: LARRY
D: That got nothing to do with it. That’s just something that happened.
E: stops him immediately
C: BILL HODGES
D: All right. My apologies. Let me just say one thing... ISU. Indiana. I don’t care. But don’t let that hurt swallow the rest of your life. Don’t be the best player that no one ever heard of.
N: With that Hodges goes, leaving Larry, deep in thought as we -- FLASHBACK TO:
S: INT. SPRING VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 1975)
N: THREE YEARS AGO. A packed house. Edge of their seats as -- YOUNG LARRY, a junior for Spring Valley, shoots free throws. Game on the line. Team down by one. No time on the clock. Larry drains both. Ice in his 16-year-old veins. The CROWD goes through the roof. No one more excited than -- Larry’s father, Joe Bird, clapping wildly in the stands and --
S: INT. BIRD FAMILY HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK - 1975)
N: Joe Bird now sits beside his son in the kitchen of their very humble house getting the hard sell from INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEAD COACH -- BOBBY KNIGHT (30. Famously hard-ass. The spitting image of a young Charles Grodin.)
C: BOBBY KNIGHT
D: When I recruit a player, Larry, for the University of Indiana, I expect them to earn it.
E: MORE
C: BOBBY KNIGHT
D: To work hard, go to class, to graduate, and win, and from what I can tell, you got a hell of a drive. We’d love for you to come be a Hoosier.
E: CONT'D
N: Larry shakes Bob’s hand, sealing it as his father looks on.
S: EXT. KIMBALL PIANO FACTORY - DAY (FLASHBACK - 1975)
N: At grand piano factory, the biggest employer in French Lick --
C: JOE BIRD
D: -- these experts in Europe, they can tell where a piano comes from just from the look of the lacquer.
E: PRELAP
S: INT. KIMBALL PIANO FACTORY - DAY (FLASHBACK - 1975)
N: Joe Bird’s in the spray both of a sprawling organ factory, lacquering the cabinet of a grand piano. Fine, custom work. Larry looks on with pride and --
C: JOE BIRD
D: One over there could be at Carnegie Hall. One piano I painted was gonna be on TV. Supposed to at least...
E: PRELAP
N: A FEW MOMENTS LATER Larry follows his father through the main floor of the factory, filled with gleaming black pianos. They look like coffins.
C: JOE BIRD
D: Point I’m making I guess, when you work on something special -- you see it all the way through. From the very beginning when it’s just an idea, all the way to the end, and the finishing touches. That’s something you can be proud of. That’s what you’re going to do.
E: CONT’D
N: Larry takes this to heart. And when Joe, a hard living man cut right from a Steinbeck novel, puts his hand on Larry’s shoulder, in what passes for affection, Larry is whole and --
S: EXT. BIRD FAMILY HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK 1975)
N: A few months later, Larry’s leaving for college. He hugs his mom, siblings, and Granny before saying goodbye to his dad.
C: JOE BIRD
D: It’s a first rate program up there. It’s sure going to be something. Call us when you’re settled.
N: Joe Bird is not going. They do not have a car. Instead, Larry’s uncle, AMOS KEARNS, is going to give him a lift. Larry tosses his ONE BAG in the back and gets in the car.
C: MARK
D: Give ‘em hell.
N: Then he’s gone, looking back at his Father, waving proudly behind as we DISSOLVE BACK TO:
S: EXT. FRENCH LICK GRAVEYARD - DAY (1976)
N: Where 19-year-old Larry stands in a cemetery, Caterpillar hat in hand, looking over a simple grave. His father’s. JOE BIRD. You’ll never catch Larry crying, but off his obvious pain --
S: INT. FLICK’S DINNER, FRENCH LICK - DAY
N: We finally meet Larry’s mother, GEORGIA BIRD, working a waitressing shift at a French Lick greasy spoon. A hard-working, 45-year-old mother of six with zero self pity and even less patience for fools, she yells at a COOK with her arms full of dishes.
C: GEORGIA
D: Where the heck is that burger? I got two tickets waiting already.
C: COOK
D: It’s coming. Hold on, unless you want it still bleeding.
C: GEORGIA
D: I don’t care if it’s moo-ing. What I don’t want to hear’s any moaning and groaning when I’m out here busting my hump and you’re screwing up tips. Only works, we’re a team.
N: Oh, and she’s demanding as well. It runs in the family. Georgia heads off steaming when ANOTHER WAITRESS approaches.
C: ANOTHER WAITRESS
D: Table three just sat down. Think you might wanna take it.
N: Georgia’s surprised to find Larry, at a table alone and -- A FEW MOMENTS LATER Georgia sits in the booth with her son. The silence is icy.
C: GEORGIA
D: Heard you were working for the Street Department.
C: LARRY
D: Yeah. A few months. Guys are great. It’s not bad.
C: GEORGIA
D: And you’re staying with Granny? Know she likes having you there. When you were boys, always did.
E: Larry nods
N: A long silence again. Finally, Larry speaks up --
C: LARRY
D: You know, I talked to Bill Hodges.
C: GEORGIA
D: Ok. Is that right?
C: LARRY
D: You didn’t tell him where I was?
C: GEORGIA
D: I slammed the door in his face. That’s what you said to do right?
N: It is and she’s done it, but her displeasure is clear.
C: LARRY
D: I know you’re mad that I left but --
C: GEORGIA
D: I don’t care. It’s your choice. You want to be a bum, fine.
N: Larry takes a long beat --
C: LARRY
D: If I stayed at Indiana, think things with dad’ve been different?
N: That changes the mood. Georgia’s armor comes down.
C: GEORGIA
D: Your dad quit on us, Larry. That’s not your fault. It’s his. It’s ok to be mad.
C: LARRY
D: I’m not mad. I’m just asking. You think if I’d stayed in...?
C: GEORGIA
D: Nothing at all would be different. Some people can’t stand things, I guess. Honey, I miss him too, but if you stay here and do nothing, you’re gonna end up just like him. It’s time to move on with your life.
E: beat
N: Off Larry, considering, cut right to the bone and --
S: EXT. INDIANA STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY
N: It’s a beautiful day at Indiana State University when Mark’s car arrives at the sleepy campus in Terre Haute, Indiana. Larry, sitting shotgun, takes in the sights out his windows. A far cry from the sprawling, crowded quads in Bloomington. Larry’s not immediately repulsed and --
S: INT. INDIANA STATE UNIVERSITY GYM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Larry, Mark, and Kevin Kearns, all in sneakers and jeans, enter the gym where a (very skeptical) ISU TEAM practices. Bill Hodges bounds over, excited to greet them.
C: BILL HODGES
D: Glad you changed your mind. Wanna run for a bit?
C: LARRY
D: That’s why drove up.
C: BILL HODGES
D: All right. Go get changed. We got some shorts and shoes in the locker room, you guys are welcome to use.
C: LARRY
D: We’ll play in these. It’s ok. That’s how we do it at home.
N: Larry picks up a ball and steps onto the court, still wearing his jeans. The ISU PLAYERS laugh. Must be some kind of joke --
C: DISMISSIVE PLAYER
D: This kid’s got some fucking balls.
C: LARRY
D: I got bigger than you.
N: And just to go prove his point, Larry puts up a 25 footer that hits nothing by net. Off the ISU TEAM’S eye-roll --- WE MONTAGE THROUGH A SCRIMMAGE Where Larry, Mark, and Kevin humiliate the ISU STARTING FIVE. They pick them apart with back-doors. Defend like a swarm. Hit bombs from so deep the starters throw up their hands and - Once Larry’s last 20-footer drops in their faces, bringing the game to an end, the dismissive player shakes his hand.
C: DISMISSIVE PLAYER
D: Hate to see how you play in shorts.
C: LARRY
D: Just get a better look at my balls.
N: Larry and the player both laugh as Hodges approaches.
C: BILL HODGES
D: I told you we could use you. It’s not Bloomington, Larry. We got a small town feel here. You can just come and play ball. Maybe do something special. What do you say? Wanna get back in the game?
E: beat
N: Off Larry, who for the first time, is considering and --
S: EXT. FLICK’S DINNER, FRENCH LICK - NIGHT
N: It’s dark at the dinner where Georgia Bird’s hauling trash to the dumpster at the end of a shift when she sees Larry, standing by her car in the lot. A long beat.
C: LARRY
D: Want a hand?
N: She tosses the bag in the dumpster herself. Tough as nails.
C: GEORGIA
D: Heard you went up to Terre Haute. Mark said you guys played. Are those boys any good?
C: LARRY
D: Not right now, they ain’t, no -- But when I get there they will be.
E: Larry takes a long beat
N: Hold on Georgia a beat, realizing what he’s saying.
C: GEORGIA
D: You gonna graduate this time?
C: LARRY
D: I’ll do better than that. I’m gonna bring home a championship.
N: That’s a pretty tall order. Off Larry’s extreme confidence --
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. INDIANA STATE UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON
N: A TITLE CARD READS: TWO YEARS LATER -- and a whole lot has changed. The formerly, sleepy little campus is buzzing as STUDENTS hurry across the quad toward -- THE HULMAN CENTER GYM where lines snake out the door for the hottest ticket in town.
C: ANOUNCER #1
D: Before Larry Bird arrived, the Indiana State Sycamores had never so much as even reached the NCAA tournament but now...
E: PRELAP
S: INT. HULMAN CENTER - GYM - AFTERNOON
N: A packed crowd fills the seats watching Larry (21) and the undefeated ISU SYCAMORES grinding through a tough game against ILLINOIS STATE.
C: ANOUNCER #1
D: In his senior year, Larry Bird’s team is number one in the nation. With an undefeated record of 18-0, Bird leads college basketball in nearly every statistical category, it’s hard to see what stands behind him and an NCAA Championship.
N: And Larry proves it on the court where with ONE MINUTE LEFT IN THE FOURTH, ISU’s down 67-68, Larry’s got the ball deep in the corner. DEFENDER painted all over him until -- In a savage move he’s made famous, Larry fakes a pass over the defender’s head, turning the poor kid around like a dog playing fetch only -- Larry’s still got the ball and before the defender even knows it, Larry drains a deep jumper, giving his team the lead.
C: ANOUNCER #1
D: And Bird does it again! Keeping their undefeated season alive.
E: V.O.
N: The CROWD ROARS. Many, ATTRACTIVE YOUNG CO-EDS wearing “I’M A BIRD WATCHER” T-shirt. Larry’s face on their chest. The game should be all over only on the ensuing possession, LEROY (one of Larry’s teammates) reaches over the line, bone- headedly fouling the INBOUNDER.
C: ANOUNCER #1
D: Oh! Big mistake. That’s put Illinois on the line, with a chance to take the lead.
N: Larry’s look could kill. Leroy can’t even look at him. And when the ISU INBOUNDER sinks both free-throws, giving his team the lead with just two seconds left -- Leroy knows he’s dead-meat. Bill Hodges calls time-out and Larry heads to the bench, steaming with anger. The Sycamores huddle. Coach draws up a play. Larry’s not listening. Eyes burning through Leroy when -- The REF blows the whistle and the team takes the court. Larry whispers to his inbounder, CARL NICKS.
C: LARRY
D: Just get me the damn ball.
N: Nicks knows better than to argue. With two seconds left, he takes the ball out of bounds. Everyone knows where it’s going. At the top of the key, Larry’s draped with defenders, but Nicks throws him the ball -- the CLOCK drops to ONE as -- Larry spins back, letting loose a long fadeaway over the outstretched fingers of the entire ILLINOIS STATE TEAM that -- BANG! Falls straight through the net as time runs off the clock. Everyone jumps on Larry, who still stares down Leroy. A REPORTER APPROACHES.
C: REPORTER
D: Amazing shot at the end. Larry, how’d you pull this one off?
C: LARRY
D: You watched the game. You just saw. Why don’t you write it yourself?
N: The Reporter is dumbfounded as Larry storms off into the tunnel, with other things on his mind and --
S: INT. SYCAMORES LOCKER ROOM, HULMAN CENTER - THAT MOMENT
N: Barreling into the locker room, Larry beelines for Leroy.
C: LARRY
D: Are you happy now, Leroy?
C: LEROY
D: Get the fuck out of my face.
N: It quickly could come to blows. Carl jumps in to defuse.
C: CARL
D: C’mon, Larry. We won. It was just a mistake.
C: LARRY
D: We can’t make no mistakes. We wanna finish this run, we gotta fucking be perfect. You don’t want to be out here, you can get the hell out.
N: Leroy is furious. Mumbles under breath --
C: LARRY
D: You got something to say?
E: CONT’D
C: LEROY
D: If I did, what’s the point? Not like you let any of us talk, you fucking Goober.
N: Leroy heads off to the showers, leaving Larry burning up.
C: CARL
D: Just cut him some slack. I know you want to win, but it’s hard on the guys. You get all the attention. Makes some fellas feel jealous.
C: LARRY
D: Hell, I’m the one should be jealous.
C: CARL
D: Oh yeah. Really? Why’s that?
C: LARRY
D: ‘Cause I never got to play beside a player like Larry Bird.
N: Off Carl’s laugh, knowing Larry is serious. But he’s earned those kind of balls because --
S: INT. GYM, HOLMEN CENTER - HOURS LATER
N: When the fans are long gone and the other players have left, a JANITOR sweeps the dark, empty stands watching -- Larry, shooting free throws in the dark. Again and again.
C: JANITOR
D: Larry! Game’s over. Why you still out here shooting 500 free throws?
C: LARRY
D: ‘Cause there’s somebody somewhere shooting five hundred and one.
C: JANITOR
D: He don’t have a life either?
N: That gets a laugh out of Larry, who puts up one more and --
C: DINAH
D: Excuse me. Aren’t you Larry Bird?
E: PRELAP
S: INT. THE BALLYHO - NIGHT
N: Larry is drinking a beer at his local college bar (his favorite place outside of the gym) when a funny, beautiful, down to earth co-ed approaches. DINAH.
C: DINAH
D: I don’t have one of those t-shirts but would you sign my magazine?
N: She places a SPORTS ILLUSTRATED on the bar. A pretty amazing artifact. THE 1977 COLLEGE BASKETBALL PREVIEW. ON THE COVER: Larry’s in his powder blue uniform. TWO COMELY CHEERLEADERS beside him, fingers raised to their lips. The headline reads: “COLLEGE BASKETBALL’S SECRET WEAPON” Larry can hardly even look at it. It’s goofy as hell.
C: LARRY
D: You’re not a reporter are you? I swear to god, I didn’t lay a hand on those girls.
C: DINAH
D: You better not, cause I’d kill you.
N: Then Dinah kisses Larry and we understand, they’re a couple.
C: DINAH
D: You wanna get out of here, or you still putting in work?

S: INT. LARRY’S DORM ROOM - LATER
N: Larry lies with Dinah in bed. Both breathless and flushed. They’re not quite smoking cigarettes but you get the point. Larry looks at his feet, hanging over the foot of the bed.
C: LARRY
D: They gotta make these beds bigger.
C: DINAH
D: Could say the same about you.
N: Larry elbows her, laughs. She rolls into his arm.
C: DINAH
D: Can I ask you a question? The Sports Illustrated cover, why didn’t you give them an interview?
E: CONT’D
C: LARRY
D: Just don’t like those reporters. They don’t care about basketball. They just wanna know personal stuff. Where you’re from? What’s your brother’s name? What are you doing tomorrow?
N: Dinah laughs. Assuming Larry is kidding. He’s not.
C: LARRY
D: You gotta be careful ‘cause a lot of them want to find out what goes on inside you. The private you. They don’t even want to talk about basketball. They’re interested in knowing who your girlfriend is or why you worked on a garbage truck.
E: CONT’D
C: DINAH
D: And what’s so bad about that?
C: LARRY
D: It’s just nobody’s business.
C: DINAH
D: Not even mine?
N: Larry takes a beat, thinking and --
C: LARRY
D: You know what I love about playing? Sometimes, you get in a game and just everything’s working. You can see all the angles. You can make any shot and when you get in that zone -- like we’ve been playing on season -- everything else fades away. There’s no past. There’s no problems. It’s just like nothing else matters. Beautifulest thing in the world. Not to think about nothing. That’s what I’m trying to do. Finish something. Perfect.
N: Dinah is wise and knows he’s talking about much more.
C: DINAH
D: Well, you’re 33-0. Who do you think’s going to stop you?
C: LARRY
D: He’s trying. I know.
N: Larry reaches over to his desk and produces another SPORTS ILLUSTRATED ISSUE. On the cover of this one: MAGIC JOHNSON. Floating to the rim in a top hat and tails.
C: DINAH
D: Top hat? Are you kidding? Magic Johnson can’t touch you. But... I bet he did give an interview.

D: And Magic hits another and that’s four in a row and the Spartan’s just look unstoppable / And Kelser connects again and it’s 30-6 and we may just be seeing the best team in Basketball.
E: V.O.
N: From Larry’s eagle-eyed P.O.V, we see Magic tear the UPENN team apart. 50-17 at the half and Magic’s putting on a show. He runs a two-on-one break, dishing no-look to a cutting TERRY DONNELY. Hits a sky-hook in the lane in a move he’ll make famous. Nails a 17-foot bank from the wing, shutting up doubters who think he can’t shoot as -- Larry watches it all with the eyes of a sniper trying to crosshair his prey, realizing he might be outmatched until --

S: INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
N: JOHN HURT is on screen, eating dinner on the Nostromo. JOHN HURT (ON MOVIE SCREEN) The first thing I’m gonna do when I get back is eat some decent food. The whole ISU team watches ALIEN in the dark. Cowboy boots propped up on the seats. Larry watches, distracted as -- YAPHET KOTTO (ON MOVIE SCREEN) Listen, I’d rather be eating something else but, right now I’ll stick to food. THEATERS GOERS in front of him CACKLE loudly at the screen.

N: Magic, all smiles, happy to see an old friend only --
C: LARRY

D: I don’t care. Yeah, that’s fine. I just wanna get out there.
N: Larry’s focus is frightening. A fighter waiting for the bell as the roar of crowd crescendos through the walls and --
S: INT. COURT - SPECIAL EVENTS CENTER - NIGHT
N: The crowd’s just going nuts when the teams take the court. Larry and Magic shake hands. There is no smiling now. It’s just war. They both position off the tip and -- Here we go. The Ref tosses the ball and Michigan gets it first, feeding to Magic at the line. He makes a quick move to the basket, blowing by his defender, but trips on the way and the Ref blows him for traveling. Larry helps Magic up, shoving him briskly away, running off down the court. Magic knows now, that’s how it will be and -- MUSIC CUE KICKS IN AS WE MONTAGE THROUGH THE GAME Larry’s double-teamed on the block, dishing it off to his POINT GUARD at the key who neatly buries a jumper and -- Magic takes a rebound coast to coast, gliding in for a lay- up, exploding in a high-five as the ref calls a foul and -- Larry cuts along the baseline, catching a pass in the corner, draining at 20-foot in two defenders’ faces and -- Magic answers right back with a hook of his own which has Georgia Bird, screaming mad in stands and -- Larry hopes to answer right back but Heaton (his center) misses a wide open jumper and -- Leroy (his point guard) dribbles the ball off his foot and -- We get the sense that Larry knows, no matter how much he wants it, it’s going to be a long haul because -- The MSU team is just way too athletic. With Magic pushing the break, they hit shot after shot and -- On defense, Larry is swarmed at all times by two and three spartan defenders, forced to give up the ball, leaving -- Larry shaking his head as the clock ticks out at half-time with the Spartan’s leading 37-28 at the break and --
S: INT. ISU LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
N: Larry paces the room as Coach address the exhausted team.
C: COACH HODGES
D: You gotta dig in. I know they’re fast, but you gotta get back. Don’t let them run on the break. We haven’t lost the whole season. You wanna fucking start now?
N: Larry’s studying the faces of his rattled teammates, knowing if they’re going to come back, it will be on his back so --
S: INT. COURT - SPECIAL EVENTS CENTER - NIGHT
N: -- when the second half starts, Larry is on the offensive -- He forces up a tough shot over three MSU defenders, but it catches the iron and -- When he posts up down low with three defenders all over him, his teammates throw it away, leaving Larry just fuming and -- When Larry shoots free throws at the line, trying to will his team back, the greatest shooter in NCAA history misses and -- Larry hangs his head, hope starting to wain as -- Magic and Kesler continue to tear the defense apart with a half-court alley-oop that’s rips out Bird’s heart. Even Terry Donnelly is knocking down jumpers and before Larry can blink the scoreboard tells us his team’s down 16 and -- He looks to the stands where Dinah and his mom feel his pain, knowing what this all means, willing him to continue so -- Larry digs in a last time, knowing this is his chance. On the next defensive possession, he snags a tough rebound, taking a foul from Greg Kesler that sends the MSU star to the bench --
C: ANNOUNCER
D: That’s four fouls on Kesler and he’ll have to sit down. There may be life in this yet.
E: V.O.
N: And Larry makes sure to squeeze it, hitting Nicks for a lay- up with a behind the back dagger and -- A few seconds later, Larry hits a tough turn around that cuts the lead to just nine and on the ensuing possession -- Nicks steals a pass! Feeds it Bird on the block who hits another turn around J narrowing the lead to just six and -- MSU COACH HEATHCOAT’s livid and Georgia Bird and the ISU FANS all explode, tasting a little new life but -- THAT’S AS CLOSE AS THEY’LL GET. A few seconds later -- Kelser checks back in the game and on the very next play, he hits Magic back door, soaring right down the lane for a one- handed slam that posterizes three ISU Defenders as -- Larry watches, just helpless as the ball drops through nylon, taking the last of his hope right out the door with it. Magic walks to the line, eyeing Larry as he goes, saying -- this game is over and -- Larry’s aware that it is as Magic sinks his foul shot and saunters back on D, flashing that smile as -- Larry’s shoulders drop, knowing there’s no coming back and -- A FEW MINUTES LATER It’s over. Magic heaves a full court pass to a wide-open Kelser who windmills it in as the final horn blows and -- Just like that, the dream’s gone. Jubilation for the Spartans. Agony for Larry and the Sycamores. For a moment, as the confetti falls and the fans storm the court and the press all descend -- Magic and Larry pass each other in the crowd but this time neither star stops or looks the other man the eye -- They just lightly brush by as Bird exits the court with his heart in his throat, only this time -- WE DO NOT GO WITH HIM. We stay focused on Magic, swarmed by reporters. With his victorious arm draped around a YOUNG BRYANT GUBMLE.
C: YOUNG BRYANT GUMBLE
D: Magic, not only were you a leader on offense, but I thought you did a great job on Larry Bird, in the zone, denying him the ball --
C: MAGIC
D: Yes - uh - coach uh - gave us a good game plan to go against Larry Bird and all we had to do was go out and do it. That’s what we done.
C: YOUNG BRYANT GUMBLE
D: Well congratulations. Super ball game.
C: MAGIC
D: Thank you!
N: Magic heads off to celebrate, catching a last look at -- Larry, in grief on the bench, crying into a towel with a new mission in life. Defeat the man who just killed his dreams. But that needs to wait because this time belongs to Magic. As he’s lifted up onto his teammates’ shoulders and cuts down the nets, we’re aware in this moment -- The world’s his for the taking. We’re along for the ride as --

D: Yeah, call me later. I’m --
N: But she’s hung up the phone as we end on: Magic, with the vacant receiver. In the empty apartment. Microwave tray on his lap. He pushes it away, feeling sorry for himself when -- THE PHONE RINGS again. Magic answers immediately.
C: MAGIC
D: Yeah, you better call back. Hanging up on you brother like -- oh! No, I’m sorry. Dr. Buss? I thought you were my sister. We were just on the... do I like Donuts? You bet... Yeah, I think I can find it. Let me just grab a pen.

S: INT. LOS ANGELES DONUT SHOP - MORNING
N: A few days later, Magic sits in a greasy Donut Shop, sharing a box of chocolate donuts with his boss, the Lakers owner -- DR. JERRY BUSS. A Burt Reynolds-handsome, 50-year-old playboy with a porn star mustache and western denim shirt unbuttoned mid-chest. A true American original.
C: BUSS
D: ...and how are you liking the apartment?
C: MAGIC
D: Oh, it’s terrific. Thanks a lot.
C: BUSS
D: I thought it would be a good base to get acclimated in town. Close to the practice facilities and all but... I own all kinds of property. Places all over town so if there’s something else that you’d like, don’t hesitate to just ask.
E: chewing over donut
C: MAGIC
D: Thank you so much. It’s great.
C: BUSS
D: Well, it’s the least I can do. And how do you like the donuts? The chocolate ones are my favorite.
N: Magic smiles at Buss. Not your typical owner.
C: BUSS
D: I know how it is, being in a new place is tough.
E: CONT’D MORE
C: BUSS
D: I just bought the team too, so it’s my first year as well. We’ll get through it together because I’ve got a plan. Do you like football at all, Magic? Something I want you to see.
E: CONT’D then
S: INT. DARK TUNNEL - DAY
N: And then Dr. Buss is leading Magic through a dark, noisy tunnel. Like Henry Hill at the Copa.
C: BUSS
D: See, what the league doesn’t get -- they think the problem is race, but they’re wrong. It’s the product. It’s stale. I’ve got a dream for the Lakers. I want to put on a show. Basketball’s not just a game, it should be entertainment. The hottest ticket in town and Magic, that’s why you’re here.
N: Magic must squint as they emerge from the tunnel into the blazing hot sun, blaring down above --
S: EXT. ROSE BOWL STADIUM - DAY
N: -- where Magic and Buss emerge directly onto the field of a USC Football Game. The energy and scale are just seismic. Buss lights a cigar, pointing Magic toward the band.
C: BUSS
D: See the spectacle, Magic? With the band and the dancers. That’s what brings out a crowd.
N: Magic takes in the moment. The roar of the stadium. The legs of the cheerleaders.
C: BUSS
D: I used to go to a classy club in Santa Monica called The Horn. Beautiful dancers. The works. And before they would come out, they would dim all the lights, get everyone all excited assing “Showtime!” And everyone would go nuts. That’s what I’m bringing to the Lakers. The best food.
E: CONT’D MORE
C: BUSS
D: The best seats. The prettiest women in town, dancing right on the court. This is Hollywood, Magic, and we have to give them a show.
E: CONT’D
C: MAGIC
D: That sounds great, Dr. Buss, but these older guys, I don’t know -- they don’t play like I play --

D: That’s exactly why I got you. Kareem’s a great player but he doesn’t have IT. He’s a philosophizing, black Muslim who even hates his own fans.
T: FLASH CUT TO:
S: EXT. FORUM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: Kareem in a Dashiki approached by an adoring YOUNG WHITE FAN.
C: YOUNG WHITE FAN
D: Hey Kareem! You’re my favorite. Could I please get an autograph?
C: KAREEM
D: Go fuck yourself, kid.
N: The kid starts to cry. Kareem never looks back.
C: BUSS
D: That’s doesn’t exactly put the butts in the seats.
E: PRE-LAP
T: CUT BACK TO:
S: EXT. ROSE BOWL STADIUM - AS BEFORE
N: Magic, listening on the sidelines to Buss.
C: BUSS
D: But you, Magic? You got IT come out of your ears. Don’t believe me? Just listen.
N: Because right at this moment, the crowd has discovered Magic and Buss on the field and a chant’s begun to ring out --
C: CROWD
D: Magic! Magic! Magic! Magic!
C: BUSS
D: Go on, wave your hand.
N: Magic waves to the crowd, sending them into a frenzy.
C: BUSS
D: This is Hollywood, Magic, and we need a star. You can’t run from the spotlight. I want you to grab it.
E: CONT’D
N: Magic soaks up the applause. Hard to say no to that and --
S: EXT. MALIBU - NIGHT
N: Waves crash in the moonlight as Magic’s date continues at -- I/E. DONALD STERLING’S MALIBU MANSION - NIGHT -- where a glamorous beach party rages. Dr. Buss weaves Magic through an audacious home full of STARLETS and CELEBRITIES --
C: BUSS
D: Hello Jamie. Hey there Connie. Looking special tonight.
N: LEGGY WOMEN kiss Dr. Buss. He seems to run this whole town. Magic is absolutely enthralled as Buss continues his sermon.
C: BUSS
D: All the glitz you see here, I want that flash on the court. When people think of New York, what do they think of? The Yankees. The Lakers will be that for L.A. and you’re gonna be our Babe Ruth. And all this comes with that.
E: CONT’D
N: He waves his hand over the party. The money. The women. Handing Magic a glass of Champagne.
C: MAGIC
D: Oh, no thanks. I don’t drink.
C: BUSS
D: That’s alright. No, that’s great. There’s plenty of ways to get high.
N: Magic watches Buss down his own drink and then --
S: INT. HOLLYWOOD NIGHTCLUB - VERY LATE AT NIGHT
N: Many hours later, Magic sits VIP with a very drunk Buss watching a parade of beautiful women dance at the club.
C: BUSS
D: That’s Janet White. Isn’t she gorgeous? I bought her that dress.
N: He’s not talking about the dance floor. He is flipping through a PHOTO ALBUM he’s brought. Inside, page after page of polaroid pics of Dr. Buss and YOUNG WOMEN.
C: BUSS
D: This is the premiere of Saturday Night Fever. That’s Kiki DuCette, she was one of the backup dancers... This is Angela Tarpetti, she’s a really sweet girl, I actually knew her back in Wyoming. But she didn’t look like this then.
E: CONT’D
N: Magic’s jaw on the floor. As creepy as this sounds, Buss is actually sweet. A sex addict, but sweet.
C: MAGIC
D: Are all owners like you? Cause Dr. Buss - I don’t know. All these ladies in here, you must have a jump shot I don’t know about.
C: JERRY BUSS
D: No, son. My talent’s up here. Got scholarships to good schools. Tried the straight life for a while, but it wasn’t for me. Went into the real estate business. Had to give Jack Kemp the Chrysler Building to buy the Lakers, but you know, Magic, it was worth it.
E: points to his brain
C: MAGIC
D: Dr. Buss! You owned the Chrysler Building?
N: Buss nods, eyes dreaming. Waxing very nostalgic.
C: BUSS
D: Soon as the deals were all signed, I got the keys to the Forum. Bought a bottle of Jack. Went in the middle of the night.
S: INT. LOS ANGELES FORUM - (FLASHBACK)
N: A SINGLE SPOTLIGHT SPARKS ON in the empty arena illuminating Dr. Buss. Giddy. Drunk. Standing center court, said bottle of whiskey bottle in hand.
C: BUSS
D: I stood and took it all in. Screamed at the top of my lungs --
E: V.O.
C: BUSS
D: I FUCKING OWN THIS PLACE MAN!
N: Buss’s voice echoes out. Followed by his laughter as we -- RETURN TO:
S: INT. NIGHT CLUB - AS BEFORE
N: Jerry and Magic, as before in the club. Deep in his reverie.
C: BUSS
D: I wanted that my whole life. And now I’ve fucking got it. Magic, I want that for you.
N: He puts his arm around Magic. Fatherly. Drunkenly. Earnestly.
C: BUSS
D: You gotta make this team yours. These old guys take it for granted, but you can’t sleep walk through life. Don’t ever let anybody tell you not to be who you are or live how you want. What’s all this for if you don’t?
E: CONT’D
N: Off Magic, who’s found his shaman in life as we end on:
S: INT. LOS ANGELES FORUM - (FLASHBACK)

E: V.O.
N: Magic takes the court, ripping off his warm-up only -- his foot gets caught in the pant leg and he falls to the ground. The CLIPPERS CROWD jeers. Not the start Magic hoped for and -- ONCE WE’RE INTO THE GAME ...it doesn’t get too much better. Trying too hard, Magic forces up a bad shot. He turns over the ball attempting a too flashy pass. He’s beat badly on defense and can’t find his rhythm until -- COACH PAUL WESTHEAD finally pulls him out of the game and Magic, deflated, takes a seat on the bench as WE DISSOLVE TO: 10 SECONDS LEFT IN THE GAME ...it looks like Magic and Showtime’s debut will be spoiled.
C: BRENT MUSBERGER
D: The Clippers are leading by one with 10 seconds left in the game. Just need to run out the clock and - - HOLY COW! I don’t believe it.

N: A Clippers player, FREEMAN WILLIAMS, dribbles the ball of his foot and it rolls out of bounds.
C: BRENT MUSBURGER
D: Freeman Williams has given the Lakers new life!
E: V.O.
N: The crowd’s apoplectic. Westhead calls a time out with THREE SECONDS left and The Lakers gather as he draws up the play.
C: PAUL WESTHEAD
D: Magic, cut to the basket. Kareem’ll be open at the line. We got one shot. Get it done.
N: The Lakers retake the floor. DON FORD inbounding the ball. The REF’S WHISTLE BLOWS and Magic cuts to the basket, clearing out his defender, leaving -- Kareem open at the foul line. Ford inbounds him the ball and he immediately soars for a SKY HOOK that’s --
C: BRENT MUSBURGER
D: Good! Lakers win. Score it!
E: V.O.
N: And the Lakers go nuts. Well, at least Magic does, rushing Kareem, jumping into his arms like he’s just saved the world.
C: BRENT MUSBURGER
D: And Magic Johnson is out there celebrating like they just won the NCAA championship.
E: V.O.
N: Magic’s jumping up and down. Hugging Kareem’s neck. Kareem’s extremely uncomfortable.
C: KAREEM
D: What the fuck are you doing? We’ve got 81 more of these.
C: MAGIC
D: You keeping hitting that shot, I’ll hug you 81 more times.
N: Kareem doesn’t know what to say. It’s the first game of the season but it’s already clear, there’s Magic in the air as -- WE MONTAGE THROUGH THE 1979 LAKERS SEASON And Showtime is on. At the first home game at the Forum, Dr. Buss paces nervously on the baseline as --
C: CHUCK HEARN
D: Ladies and Gentleman, making their debut today at the Forum, please welcome -- The Laker Girls!
E: V.O.
N: And FOUR USC and FOUR UCLA dancers, all young, taut, and painfully hot, dance into the arena. The CROWD goes berserk. Buss’ smile, ear to ear as -- - During a game against Phoenix, Magic shake and bakes on the break, hitting a streaking Jamal Wilkes for a slam and -- - On another fast break, Magic goes behind the back, no-look to Michael Cooper who throws down a dunk as -- - THE STARS sitting courtside jump out of their seats. JACK NICHOLSON and STALLONE. BO DEREK and FRANK SINATRA. It’s the hottest party in town and Magic’s the number one star -- - We see photographs of Magic, smiling to reporters in the Locker room.

E: ON TV
N: - It continues at night when Magic dances with Dr. Buss at PIP’S NIGHTCLUB in BEVERLY HILLS, alongside PRINCE and MICHAEL DOUGLASS and the hottest women on earth and -- - ON MOVIE NIGHT AT THE PLAYBOY MANSION, Magic sits with Buss in Hef’s pool having a hard time paying attention to STAR WARS on an outdoor screen while PLAYMATES lick his ears and -- - It’s just as glitzy on the court. Even Kareem has a laugh after hitting a skyhook off a Magic no-look. His energy’s just infectious and -- - It peaks on court in the WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS when Kareem hugs Magic, lifting his finger up to the rafters after defeating the SEATTLE SUPERSONICS 4-1 and --
C: BRENT MUSBURGER
D: LA’s headed back to the NBA FINALS. Get ready for Showtime, America!

D: THE SERIES IS TIED 2-2
N: And Magic’s Lakers are up in a tight game. Kareem can’t be stopped. He’s already got 24 when -- He gets the ball at the right post, pivoting into the lane, for a sweet finger roll that drops through the net only -- When Kareem lands, his ankle rolls badly and he nearly falls to the ground, limping off to the sidelines.
C: BRENT MUSBERGER
D: Kareem’s hurt! Kareem’s hurt. There’s no question about it.
E: V.O.
N: Magic and the Lakers’ fans watch in stunned silence as Kareem is carried into the tunnel.
C: BRENT MUSBERGER
D: They would be in more than serious trouble without him. I don’t think they can beat this club.
E: V.O.
N: JACK NICHOLSON slams his hat to the ground as Magic watches Kareem disappear, his ride careening to a halt and --
S: INT. LOCKER ROOM, FORUM - LATER
N: Immediately after the game (which the Lakers have squeaked out) Magic enters to the locker room to find -- Kareem in a cast, burgundy turtleneck, and crutches.
C: MAGIC
D: What’s the word? You’ll be good? We’re gonna need you tomorrow.
C: KAREEM
D: They think it’s a broken fibula probably. Still waiting on the x- rays. I can’t travel to Philly.

E: O.S.

C: NIXON
D: Buck, what the fuck are you doing? That’s Cap’s seat.

C: BRENT MUSBURGER
D: Magic, playing Center in the place of Kareem, will come in and jump --
E: V.O.
N: BAM! The ref tosses the ball. Magic leaps up to get it and -- THIS GAME IS HISTORIC AND NEVER REALLY EVEN CLOSE Playing POINT / CENTER, Magic puts on a show for the ages. He takes a feed in the post and dunks over three men. He drives to his left and floats skyhook through the rim. He challenges DAWKINS at the rim, hanging in mid-air for lay-up. While on D, he steals an entry pass in the post and immediately turns on the gas, dropping a nasty dime to Wilkes for a dunk on the break. He drives again and again, scoring time after time, with a creative arsenal of shots that the Sixers can’t stop and -- When all’s said and done and the final horn blows, Dr. Buss is in tears sitting courtside with a MODEL as -- Westhead and assistant Coach PAT RILEY (more on him down the road) hug in amazement on the bench and -- Magic hugs Michael Cooper, throwing his hands to the sky.
C: BRENT MUSBURGER
D: There it is. It’s all over. And the most valuable player is Magic Johnson. He starts at Center. Plays Forward and Guard and leads the Lakers to the World Championship.
E: V.O.
N: Magic has done the impossible and --
S: INT. LOCKER ROOM, PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT
N: The celebration spills into the room as the Lakers pour in. Champagne raining down. Everyone going apeshit. Musberger’s there with the microphone. Sweating all over Magic’s jock.
C: MUSBERGER
D: Let me read you these stats. 42 points. 15 rebounds. And 7 assists. This is your first year and you’re here. How many more of these would you like to get under your belt?
C: MAGIC
D: About twenty.
N: They all laugh. No one has ever been higher than Magic in this moment. He finds Dr. Buss and the two close friends hug.
C: DR. BUSS
D: You’ve earned yourself a big fucking reward, son.
N: We can only guess what this means as Cooper yells out --
C: COOPER
D: Hey Buck! You got a call! It’s some baby named Cookie! Whatchu want me to say?
N: Magic considers a moment. But for only a moment --
C: MAGIC
D: I’ll call her later, all right? I ain’t ready for that.
N: -- and he turns back to Buss, leaving Cookie (and Earvin) in the past, as he showers his owner’s head in Champagne. Two men about to embark on a victory lap that would make Mick Jagger-blush. Their jubilant faces frozen on --

N: The drunk howls in laughter as Larry walks off.
C: DRUNK PATRON
D: That’s right. Walk away. I always heard you’re a quitter.
E: CONT’D
N: Larry pauses at that.
C: DRUNK PATRON
D: You’re gonna just let this dumb monkey go and beat you again? Man, Larry Bird isn’t shit.
E: CONT’D
N: The drunk put his finger in Larry’s back and that’s the last straw and the last time he’s on his feet because -- WHAM! -- Larry cold cocks the DRUNK, knocking him down. (But, Larry also breaks two of his fingers in the process.)
C: LARRY
D: God damn it!
N: Hearing the commotion, the Bartender comes out the door.

S: EXT. RED CLAY TENNIS COURT - LATER

D: I’ll remember that next time we’re negotiating your contract. Come on, Larry. What is it?
E: Bird cuts him a look

S: EXT. RED CLAY TENNIS COURT - DAY
N: Larry and Red, as before.

N: Red and Larry, wrapping up their heart to heart.
C: RED AUERBACH
D: The thing about competition, Larry is, it can push you. It can drive you to accomplish incredible things but it can also destroy you and blind you. You need to live your life, son, because believe me, Magic -- he’s out there living his.

E: CONT’D

D: How’s it going, Dr. Buss? When you gonna get me out to The Lakers?
C: DR. BUSS
D: I’ve got a point guard already.
N: He gestures, displeased, to the COKE MUSTACHE Isaiah’s sporting. Off Isaiah, embarrassed, wiping his nose and -- FINALLY, AT THE POOL -- Magic leads Buss around a kidney shaped pool swimming with starlets. People fuck right out in the open. Doing blow off the bar. It’s a hedonist’s paradise. Buss puts his arm around Magic.
C: DR. BUSS

N: Magic just gives him a smile as -- A TITLE CARD READS: GAME ONE (And we’re in for a long sequence here. Imagine a title fight in a Rocky Film. These games will be paced out like rounds.) The teams set up for the tip. The ref tosses the ball and to Larry’s chagrin, The Lakers hits the ground running. Magic leads a four-on-two fast break -- dumps to Kurt Rambis - - who gives-and-goes back to Magic who lays it in for two. Off a missed-Larry jumper, Magic runs it coast to coast for a score. And when Larry forces a jump pass, Magic picks it off and hits a wide open Worthy for a wide open jam and -- Just like back in college, Magic’s team is too fast.

N: -- and we’re right into the game. This one is hard fought. Both team’s playing well. Larry comes out shooting well -- He hits a jumper at the line. A tough drive against Kareem. But L.A. is hot too. Kareem feeds a cutting Worthy with a nifty little dime for a slam over three Celtics. Worthy dunks again over Bird, sending Larry to the floor and -- With the 20 seconds left in the 4th, Lakers leading by two, Kevin McHale’s fouled on his way to the rim. He misses the shot, but will head to the line. The Celtics’ crowd roars.
C: BRENT MUSBERGER
D: McHale will shoot two. He needs to make both to tie the ball game.
E: V.O.

C: JOHNNY MOST
D: Dips. Shoots and...does not get it!
E: V.O.
N: He bricks the second, missing TWO FUCKING FREE THROWS with the game on the line. Magic coming down with rebound and... The Lakers bench starts celebrating. Nicholson in the crowd makes the CHOKE sign to Kevin. Red stews in his seat.
C: BRENT MUSBERGER
D: So the Lakers do not have to take a shot. They have it with 20 seconds to go and lead the Celtics 113-111.
E: V.O.
N: ON THE CELTICS BENCH. Desperate times. Desperate measures.
C: M.L.
D: We gotta come up with something. Somebody’s gotta make a play.
N: There’s nothing more to be said. They take the court.

E: V.O.
N: Worthy takes the ball out near the Lakers’ own basket. All they have to do is run out the clock. He inbounds to Magic. Immediately double teamed. Gives it back to Worthy who passes cross court to Bryon Scott only -- Gerald Henderson picks it off! Stealing the pass out of nowhere, taking it in for a lay-up that ties up the game!
C: JOHNNY MOST
D: A great play by Henderson! The Leperchaun at work here at the Garden! A steal right when you need it! It’s bedlam in Boston.
E: V.O.
N: The Celtics go nuts. The Lakers can’t believe it. Pat Riley screams for timeout, dragging his stunned team to the bench.
C: PAT RILEY
D: All right. Shake it off. We got the ball. It’s not over. Get it into Kareem and put these fuckers down.
N: Riley draws up a play. With 13 seconds left, the game tied -- The Lakers inbound again. This time at half court. Magic gets it with 10. Starts to dribble... and dribble... trying to get it into Kareem only -- He loses track of the time. And before Magic realizes what’s happened, there’s just one second left and --
C: JOHNNY MOST
D: He’s going to have to shoot it and he doesn’t get it off! He doesn’t get it off!
E: V.O.
N: The Lakers don’t even get up a shot. Magic has blown it and he can not believe it.
C: JOHNNY MOST
D: He lost track of the time and now we’re headed to overtime.
E: V.O.
N: The Lakers take the bench. Magic, gutted while in the Celtics’ huddle, Larry knows they just got a new life.
C: LARRY
D: We got ‘em by the balls. Don’t let go to get a better grip. Just keep squeezing.
N: And when overtime starts, the Celtics go for the kill. They play hard and sharp, matching each basket until finally, they have a chance to take the lead and -- They swing the ball around the key to McHale - for a chance at redemption - and he buries an arching twelve footer --
C: JOHNNY MOST
D: -- it’s good! And Boston leads. 122 to 121!

C: PAT RILEY
D: Don’t take your foot off the gas. Push it fast. Run them the fuck out of town.
N: Magic takes those words to heart and -- BAM! We’re into the game and it’s a lighting fast pace. Maxwell tries to drive on Kareem only -- BOOM! Kareem swats it out of the sky. The ball lands with Magic. He pushes the break. A dizzying four-on-one that ends with a KURT RAMBIS dunk at the Forum crowd screaming. And the whole game is like that. When Larry misses a three -- WHAM! The Lakers turn on the jets. Kareem outlets to Magic -- to Coop then to Worthy who stuffs it in for the jam! On a timeout on the BOSTON BENCH, DANNY AINGE hangs his head.
C: DANNY AINGE
D: Only way we win this is if they pass out, have to forfeit the game.
N: Larry seethes, just stewing as he watches Magic and Worthy slapping five. The Lakers fans going crazy as -- CHUCK HEARN (LAKERS ANNOUNCER V.O.)

N: When Larry enters the locker room, he goes off on his team.
C: LARRY
D: That was disgusting. Y’all played like a bunch of fucking pussies. I’m not watching Magic celebrate in front of me again.
N: He slams his a water bottle against the wall, scattering teammates, and takes a seat at his locker. A REPORTER APPROACHES.
C: REPORTER
D: Tough night, Larry. They set the pace from the start. What do you have to do different tomorrow if you want to win?
N: Larry takes a moment to consider, knowing his teammates are listening and Larry makes a decision.
C: LARRY
D: It’s embarrassing. There’s no doubt about it. We’ve got some great players on this team, but we don’t have the players with the heart sometimes we need and uh today, when you see Magic, slapping high fives and guys going behind their back and shooting lay-ups on us all day long, it seems like someone would try and put a stop to it but until we get our hearts where we belong, we’re in trouble. We played like sissies.
N: Larry teammates have heard. McHale turns to Ainge.
C: MCHALE
D: We can’t just let them dunk us all night. Gotta take some hard fouls.
C: DANNY AINGE

N: Mchale hears him, loud and clear as -- TITLE CARD READS: GAME FOUR And midway through the third, McHale takes his shot. When the Lakers push the break and Kurt Rambis soars for a dunk -- BOOM! (in one of the dirtiest plays in NBA History) - Kevin McHale clotheslines Rambis clean out of the air, smashing him hard to the ground like a bodyslam and -- All hell just breaks lose. Rambis gets to his feet charging fists first at McHale. Both benches clear fast.
C: JOHNNY MOST
D: Rambis was really decked by McHale and he didn’t like it at all!
E: V.O.
N: The powder keg bursts. Pat Riley’s in flames. Even Kareem’s on the hunt, rushing into the scrum until -- The Ref breaks them up, sending Rambis to the line. (Note: If this was 2020, McHale would be locked up in jail. He didn’t even get teched-up!) But notice is served. If this was ROCKY 4, we know this moment exactly. Drago’s been cut. The fight just turned and THE REST OF THIS GAME IS A BRAWL. And no one is sparred. Worthy’s knocked to the ground, flailing after a loose ball. Cooper’s thrown three rows into the stands by Larry when he takes out the ball and --

C: M.L.
D: Come on, Tragic. Just do it. Take one step across that line and I’ll knock your ass out.
N: Magic has to be held back until a REF intervenes to M.L.
C: REF
D: Sit down and shut up or I’ll throw you out of this game?
C: M.L. CARR
D: What do I care? Go ahead. Man, I’m not even playing.
N: Pat Riley’s livid, yelling. Even Kareem loses it. After missing a skyhook from the post, he battles Larry for a rebound when - POW! - Kareem throws an elbow at Larry’s jaw and Larry jumps in his face!
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Kareem swings the elbow and now he’s yelling at Larry Bird.
E: V.O.
C: KAREEM
D: White boy! I will kick your ass.
C: LARRY
D: I’m standing right here. Come on! Let’s see it, Kareem.
N: He’s gotten under Kareem’s skin and that’s just how Larry wants it. The benches clear again. Magic pulling Kareem away, aware this is a street fight. Not Showtime. With the Lakers on their heels, Larry walks right up to Coop.
C: LARRY
D: I’m about to wear your ass out.
E: CONT’D
N: Larry gets the ball at the top of the key, pumps Coop out of his pants, driving clean by and knocking down a sweet J.

C: M.L. CARR
D: Tragic Johnson! Tragic Johnson!
N: Larry, on the floor, can see Magic is rattled and --
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Big free throw coming up.
E: V.O.
N: Magic lines up the ball, puts up his shot and -- WOW!
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Johnson misses them both! Bird with the rebound and the Celtics want a time out and a despondent Magic Johnson goes to the bench.
E: V.O.
N: Magic can’t believe it. He heads to the bench, shaking his head while Larry takes a seat as K.C. lines up a play.
C: K.C. JONES
D: I want to get it inside. Get Rambis to switch and we’ll get the mismatch down low.
N: Larry has other plans.
C: LARRY
D: Just get me the damn ball.
N: K.C.’s a bright guy so he wisely reconsiders.
C: K.C. JONES
D: You heard what he said. Just get Larry the ball.
N: The horn sounds. The huddle breaks. Larry retakes the court. Wiping the soles of his shoes with hands as -- Larry lines up at the top of the key as they inbound the ball to Maxwell, immediately looking for Bird who -- Shakes his defender and catches the ball at the wing forcing Magic to rotate over and guard him. It’s a fantasy moment. Larry, one on one, with his rival. He swings the ball to the corner, posting Magic down low and --
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Bird goes right into the pivot. DJ in the corner. And Bird wants the ball. They go back into Bird.
E: V.O.
N: He gets position in the post with Magic right on his back. Catches the feed, spinning back for a fade-away and -- WHOOSH! Larry swishes the game winner. It drops over Magic.
C: JOHNNY MOST
D: It’s good! Boston’s taken the lead. 125-123 and they’ll head back to Boston with the series tied up and with home court advantage!
E: V.O.
N: The moment is magical. Revenge for Larry. Agony for Magic and we get the sense now, this series will go to the wire as --
C: ANNOUNCER
D: There’s a heat wave in Boston. It’s nearly 100 degrees and the idea of air conditioning in the Garden is to open the doors and have the ushers blow hard.
E: V.O.
S: INT. BOSTON GARDEN - NIGHT
N: Sweat pours off Magic, sucking wind on the bench as -- A TITLE CARD READS: GAME 5 It’s a sauna in the Garden and the Lakers are all out of gas. They slip on fastbreaks. Butter-finger the ball. It’s so hot they can’t breath and while -- Kareem spends most of the game wearing an OXYGEN MASKS on the bench, wilting in 105 degree heat and Pat Riley Gucci suit’s drenched. Even a REF nearly faints only -- The Celtics just love it. The sweltering crowd never quits and Larry has a game for the ages.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: The Boston Celtics, playing in the same humidity, look fresh, while the Lakers look exhausted.
E: V.O.
N: Guarded by Worthy, Larry pumps fakes and drive past him, taking it right down the lane, diving into the stands. He rips a defensive rebound, splitting through two defenders, dishing give-and-go on the break, ending the run with dunk as M.L. CARR waves A PAPER FAN over Larry like a Sultan and -- A TITLE CARD READS: FINAL SCORE CELTICS 121 - LAKERS 103 Magic watches from the bench, exhausted and furious and --

E: V.O.
N: They hear M.L. and Maxwell laugh, running down the tunnel.

D: You hear that?! They don’t respect you. They come knock on your door! You going to take that or what?
N: Magic looks say, no way as -- A TITLE CARD READS: GAME SIX
S: INT. FORUM - NIGHT (GAME 6)
N: And right off from the jump, the Lakers punch back. The Celtic running a two-on-one break. Henderson dropping it behind the back to a dashing Cedric Maxwell who’s skying up for the slam when -- WHAM! Payback time. Worthy comes out of nowhere, shoving him hard in the back, sending him soaring dangerously into the stands. The benches clear again!
C: ANNOUNCER
D: And now the Lakers are giving the Celtics a dose of their own medicine.
E: V.O.
N: Magic’s fired up. He takes it hard into the lane, shouldering past three defenders as the Lakers run away with Game Six.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: The Lakers are making a statement to Boston. We’re back in it and you better get ready in Beantown.
E: V.O.
N: The nail in the coffin comes when Kareem throws a full court touchdown pass to a wide open Byron Scott, who jams it home. Jack Nicholson loves it. He wears a Lakers-yellow sports coat and gives Larry the choke sign as -- A TITLE CARD READS: FINAL SCORE LAKERS 119 - CELTICS 108
S: INT. AIRPLANE - (MOVING) NIGHT
N: Boston flies home on a red-eye. His teammates asleep, Larry’s awake with a beer, staring out the window at the darkness.
C: RED AUERBACH
D: You know, the Celtics have never lost a Championship final at the Garden?
E: O.C.
N: Larry looks over to see Red now sitting beside him.
C: RED AUERBACH
D: You need a “win one for the Gipper speech” or you ready to put this to bed?
E: CONT’D
C: LARRY
D: I’ve been waiting for this game for 5 years. I ain’t losing tomorrow.
S: EXT. BOSTON GARDEN - THE NEXT NIGHT (GAME 7)
N: It all comes down to this. Fans streaming into the Garden for the final showdown of the series where -- BRENT MUSBERGER (PRE-LAP)
C: BRENT MUSBERGER
D: If you could bottle all the emotion released in a basketball game, you’d have enough hatred to start a war, and enough joy to prevent one.
E: PRE-LAP CONT’D
S: INT. BOSTON GARDEN - NIGHT
N: Brent Musberger’s back on his perch, high above the court in the rafter, broadcasting pregame.
C: BRENT MUSBERGER
D: And tonight, in the ancient Boston Garden, we’ll run the entire gamut.
N: Down on the court, Larry feels them all, lining up for the jump. Face to face with Magic. Both waiting for the tip as -- A TITLE CARD READS: GAME SEVEN The ref throws the ball and we’re off and we stay this whole game ON LARRY. CLOSE ON HIS FACE as those emotions play out. He scores. He misses. He dives into the stands after a loose ball. He gets pummeled on D and knocked to the ground. He fumes on the bench. He focuses at the line. He bodies up Magic. He dishes to Parish. He’s determined and fearful and worn out but when the final horn sounds -- LARRY IS ELATED as the GARDEN FANS storm the court when --
C: JOHNNY MOST
D: The ball game is over and we’ve got a sea of humanity out there! A wild maylay as Boston wins! Boston wins!

C: RED
D: It feels great! Whatever happened to the Los Angeles dynasty? You want to talk about a dynasty! Here it is. Here’s your dynasty now!
E: he holds up the trophy
N: The Celtics explode. Musberger makes his way to Larry, who’s now drenched in Champagne. A beer in his hand.
C: MUSBERGER
D: Larry! Does this get you even with Magic for what happened between Michigan State, Indiana State all those many years ago?
C: LARRY
D: Oh, I don’t worry about that. We’re professionals now but -- This one’s for Terre Haute!

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. GEORGIA BIRD’S NEW FRENCH LICK HOME - DAY
N: A pristine sun-kissed farm. A new brick house in the drive. And cut into the hayfields, like some Field of Dreams shit -- There’s a glass back-boarded, pro length basketball court. A TITLE CARD READS: TWO YEARS LATER And Larry’s out on the court. Not practicing his shot, but shoveling gravel for a drainage ditch on the side. Hard, backbreaking work which we know Larry loves. But, after the thousandth shovel load is pitched --

D: Jesus fuck!
N: Larry bolts over in pain. He just threw out his back.

D: Goddamnit, you idiot.

S: INT. GEORGIA BIRD’S NEW FRENCH LICK HOME - DAY

C: BOB WOOLF
D: Converse wants an answer.
E: FILTERED
C: LARRY
D: Well I already told ya. I’m trying to enjoy my summer. Drink some beer. Get some fishing. You know, just relax.... Ooh god!
N: Larry’s back seizes up and he groans in discomfort.
C: BOB WOOLF
D: You sound pretty relaxed. Look, they’re serious, Larry. It’s whole lot of money. They want you guys together. “Choose your weapon.” That’s the title.
E: FILTERED
C: LARRY
D: I don’t care. I’m not spending my summer slapping ass with the enemy.
C: BOB WOOLF
D: Magic said yes.
E: FILTERED
C: LARRY
D: Get the hell out of here. Really?
C: BOB WOOLF
D: Even said he’d come to you.

E: Larry laughs, disbelief
S: EXT. FRENCH LICK STREETS - DAY (A COUPLE WEEKS LATER)
N: A BLACK LIMO drives through the country roads of French Lick.
S: INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY (SAME)
N: Magic looks out the windows at the poor, rural surroundings. Farms spreading wide. The one stop light in town.
C: MAGIC
D: This is where Larry Bird hatched? I thought Lansing was small.
N: Magic almost seems smitten as --
S: INT. GEORGIA BIRD'S NEW FRENCH LICK HOME - DAY
N: The limo pulls down Georgie Bird’s drive where Larry, his mother, grandmother, and brother Mark, all wait.
C: GEORGIA BIRD
D: Guess you were wrong, son. Again.

C: MAGIC
D: Isn’t this some kind of place?
C: LARRY
D: How’s it going there, Earvin? Ready to get this thing over with?
C: MAGIC

N: Magic shakes all their hands warmly and beaming.
C: MAGIC
D: It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thanks for having me to your home.
N: Larry, rolling his eyes. His family, practically swooning.
S: EXT. OUTDOOR BASKETBALL COURT, GEORGIA’S HOUSE - LATER
N: The group has moved to Larry’s outdoor court where a COMMERCIAL CREW is setting up. A HOLLYWOOD DIRECTOR (ideally Jonathan) walks his stars through the scene.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Larry, you’ll be on the court here when Magic pulls up in the limo. Rolls down his window and says...
C: MAGIC
D: “I heard converse made a pair of shoes for last year’s MVP.”
E: easy as pie
N: The director smiles. Waits for Larry’s response. Never comes.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Ok. Larry -- your line.
C: LARRY
D: Now? All right. “Yep.”
N: He’s incredibly wooden.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Ok. Ok. Great. Now Magic gets out of the car and --
E: he means terrible
C: MAGIC
D: “Well they made a pair of Magic shoes for this year’s MVP.”
C: DIRECTOR
D: Wonderful. Then you’ll rip off your warm up pants and Larry you’ll toss him the ball as you say --
C: LARRY
D: Sorry. I forgot. Hold on. Yeah -- “Ok. Magic. Show me what you got.”
C: DIRECTOR
D: Nice. Ok. We’ll keep working on that. Then you throw him the ball and you’ll play one on one.
N: They both freeze.
C: MAGIC
D: Oh. Ok. So you want us to play?
C: DIRECTOR
D: Well, sure, yeah, I thought --
N: The director proposes this innocently. What he does not understand, these two men are enemies. Their armor always on.
C: LARRY
D: Want us to play, fine by me. Bring that weak shit to the hole, I’ll send it back to L.A.
C: MAGIC
D: Oh, you think you can guard me?
C: LARRY
D: Man, I don’t even have to. I’ll just leave you alone, you’ll probably dribble out the clock.
N: Watching from the sidelines, Mark Bird guffaws at that one.
C: MAGIC
D: All right, Larry. Let’s go. You’re not gonna have Gerald Henderson to save your ass now.
N: They both gear up for battle. It’s about to get ugly until --
C: DIRECTOR
D: Whoa whoa guys, hold on. You’re not actually playing. It’s just for fun. It’s pretend.
C: LARRY
D: Just a fun game? That’s all?
C: MAGIC
D: All right. I can do that.
N: Relief falls over both.
C: DIRECTOR
D: The crew’s going to set up. Why don’t you guys take a seat. This is going to be great. Jesus Christ. Kill me now.
E: but as he walks away
N: While the crew sets up the shot, Larry and Magic take a seat on the bench. Letting their guards down a bit.
C: MAGIC
D: I’m glad we don’t have to play. I wasn’t trying to go hard right now.
C: LARRY
D: Yeah, me neither. My back.
C: MAGIC
D: Oh yeah. What’s going on? Didn’t look bad playing us... for a white guy, I mean.
C: LARRY
D: C’mon, man. Not you too?
N: Magic starts laughing.
C: MAGIC
D: I’m just kidding, Larry. You know Isaiah’s an idiot.
C: LARRY
D: An idiot who’s your best friend.
C: MAGIC
D: Don’t mean, I agree what he said.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
N: THE IDIOT IN ACTION: ISAIAH THOMAS’ INFAMOUS 1985 POST-DEFEAT LOCKER ROOM INTERVIEW. HE’S SPECTACULARLY PETTY.
C: ISAIAH
D: I think Larry is a very, very good basketball player. I think he’s an exceptional talent, but I’d have to agree with Rodman. If he was black, he’d be just another good guy.
E: ON TV
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: AS BEFORE, LARRY AND MAGIC ON THE BENCH Larry’s non-plussed.
C: MAGIC
D: He was just sore you beat him that series and stole that damn pass.
C: LARRY
D: Yeah, I bet that that stung. Honestly, I don’t care. Just pissed me off I had to talk to the press and not focus on you.
E: they both enjoy that
N: Magic respects Larry largess. Takes a new stock of him now.
C: MAGIC
D: So what’s up with your back? Did you hurt it “not” jumping?
C: LARRY
D: Actually hurt it out here. Digging the ditch for the drain.
C: MAGIC
D: Wait. I’m sorry. Hold on. Larry Bird’s out here digging a ditch?
N: Magic considers this curiously. Notices a TRACTOR nearby.
C: MAGIC
D: You don’t ride that thing do you?
E: CONT’D
C: LARRY
D: ‘Course. I cut that field everyday.
C: MAGIC
D: Come on. Get the hell out?
N: Both men finally laugh.
C: MAGIC
D: It’s a pretty nice spread. This is really where you play?
E: CONT’D
C: LARRY
D: If it’s not too rainy or windy, this is where I do all my work. Where you do yours? The Playboy Mansion?
N: Magic laughs. So does a Bird.
C: MAGIC
D: You’re a straight shooter. I like that. Just like on the court.
N: And they sit there together. A little thaw in the ice and --
S: EXT. OUTDOOR BASKETBALL COURT, GEORGIA’S HOUSE - LATER
N: AS WE MONTAGE THROUGH THE COMMERCIAL SHOOT: We see the start of a friendship begin between the two men. They laugh when Larry fumbles his lines and when MAGIC RIPS OFF HIS WARM-UPS in an iconic shot of the spot. Slap five when Larry hits a tough jumper and generally, just shoot the shit, walking together through the fields on their breaks. In the short time together, they are growing a bond and -- THE MONTAGE ENDS WHEN:
C: FIRST A.D.
D: All right, guys. That’s lunch.
N: The crew starts to break. Magic heads off toward his trailer.
C: LARRY
D: Where you going? This way.
C: MAGIC
D: To my trailer, for lunch.
C: LARRY
D: Uh uh. Come on. My mom fixed lunch at the house.
N: Off Magic’s surprise. Mark Bird points to the limos.
C: MARK
D: We can give you a lift. Don’t think you can get there in those.
N: Larry and Mark share a mischievous grin and --
S: EXT. GEORGIA BIRD'S NEW FRENCH LICK HOME - MOMENTS LATER
N: Magic’s holding on for dear life on the back of a 4-WHEELER as Mark and Larry drive him through the farm.
C: LARRY
D: You all right back there, Earvin?
C: MAGIC
D: I guess this is what passes for a convertible here.
N: The Bird boys both laugh as they arrive at their mom’s house where Georgia waits in an apron. No hugs or kisses, just --
C: GEORGIA BIRD
D: Get on in. Wash your hands. Lunch is out on the porch.
N: But when it’s Magic’s turn to enter, she gives him a big hug.
C: GEORGIA BIRD
D: We’re so glad to have you. You’re my number one favorite player.
E: CONT’D
N: Larry rolls his eyes. Knew this was coming.
C: LARRY
D: She said the same thing to Isaiah. ‘Fore she knew he was an asshole.
N: And Magic’s busting a gut, as he follows Larry off toward --
S: EXT. PORCH, GEORGIA BIRD'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER
N: -- where the whole gang enjoys a fried chicken lunch. Everyone busting balls. Mark is telling a story.
C: MARK
D: ...and then Larry come home, after playing in that tournament, saying, Mark -- I just played with the best guy I’ve ever seen.
N: Larry is cringing.
C: MAGIC
D: Larry said that about me?
C: LARRY
D: That’s not how I remember it.
C: MAGIC
D: What I remember’s you dipping out the backdoor when the reporters came in.
C: LARRY
D: Can show you how to do that sometime. You know it’s possible, actually, to not talk to a camera.
C: MAGIC
D: I’ll leave that to you. Magic doesn’t go out the side door. I didn’t mean to interrupt. What else he said about me?
E: laughs to Mark
C: MARK
D: He said you were great. Just had the whole frickin’ game. Naturally, I didn’t believe it. But then you beat him in college and he took it real hard and I sat there as he cried and said -- Larry, you’re right. He’s a lot better than you.
E: loves rubbing it in
N: The table dies laughing. Larry’s red in the face.
C: LARRY
D: See with family like this, playing The Lakers ain’t nothing.
C: GEORGIA
D: Could I get you more, Earvin?
C: MAGIC
D: Yes, ma’am. It’s terrific. Haven’t eaten like this since was home with my folks. Think y’all’d get along.
N: Georgia serves Magic a plate as he absorbs the surreal scene.
C: MAGIC
D: It’s just crazy, isn’t it? Did you ever imagine that your son would become so rich and famous?
E: CONT’D
C: GEORGIA
D: I’m just happy he graduated.
C: LARRY
D: We gotta do this again?
C: MAGIC
D: You know, I talked to Coach Knight. You had stayed at Indiana, we might both of been there. Wouldn’t that of been something. Why’d you leave so quick anyway?
N: Larry cuts his mom a look --
C: GEORGIA
D: Don’t look at me? Earvin asked?
C: LARRY
D: There’s nothing really to tell. 30,000 people wasn’t my idea of school. More like a country, to me.

S: INT. FORUM - DAY (A FEW MONTHS LATER)
N: Magic walks on the court for first day of preseason, greeting everyone joyously. COOP and BYRON SCOTT greet him, giggling.
C: MAGIC
D: What up fellas? How’s your summer?
C: COOP
D: “Okay Magic. Show me what you got?”
E: mimicking Bird
N: Scott rips off his warm-ups, mimicking Magic’s performance.
C: SCOTT
D: Choose your weapon!
N: They both bust up laughing.
C: MAGIC
D: All right. Very funny. When y’all get a commercial, you can make fun of my acting. Until then, shut up.
N: They’re still rolling in stitches when Pat Riley approaches.
C: MAGIC
D: Everyone’s a critic now, huh?
E: CONT’D
C: RILEY
D: You shouldn’t have done it. You set the examples for this team and that makes it looks like we’re soft. I hope you left that grab-assing shit in French Lick.
N: Riley heads off. Magic, a bit stunned. Dr. Buss arrives next.
C: DR. BUSS
D: Don’t worry about Pat. Guy wins a few rings, starts to think he’s a genius. Come over here. I want you to meet someone new.
N: Buss leads Magic over toward a strapping, bright eyed, jheri curled, choir-boy ROOKIE.
C: DR. BUSS
D: Magic -- A.C. Green. He’s the new kid from Oregon.
E: CONT’D
C: MAGIC
D: Nice to meet ya. You ready to work?
C: A.C. GREEN
D: Yes, sir. Born ready. “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.”

D: Virgin.

C: MAGIC
D: I got a question for you.
E: O.S.
N: Magic takes the empty seat beside him. A.C. is surprised.
C: MAGIC
D: Is it true in college, you boycotted the school bookstore cause they’re selling Playboy? You never been with a women?
E: CONT’D A.C. nods
C: A.C. GREEN
D: Premarital sex is a sin.
C: MAGIC
D: Is that right? I’m gonna make you a bet... two months. That’s how long I give you before you’re a sinner like us. Cause once you see all these ladies, the only book you’re going to boycot is that.
N: He points to the Bible, giving A.C. a wicked smile and --
S: EXT. NEW YORK HOTEL - NIGHT
N: When A.C. departs the bus at their New York Hotel, his knees already shake seeing the line-up of KNOCKOUTS waiting outside the door. Magic walks by, with a “told you so” laugh and --
S: INT. A.C.’S HOTEL ROOM - A FEW HOURS LATER
N: Like he’s warding off evil spirits, A.C. paces the room with his bible, SINGING HYMNS at the top of his lungs trying to drown out -- the chorus of WOMEN KNOCKING ON HIS DOOR.
C: WOMEN
D: Come on, baby! Let us in. We won’t bite. Unless you ask.
E: O.S.
N: A.C. belts his prayers louder as --
S: INT. OUTSIDE A.C.’S ROOM, HOTEL - NIGHT
N: Magic listens to his songs, standing with THREE WOMEN, trying in vain to tempt A.C. out. It’s not going to happen.
C: WOMEN
D: His loss.
C: MAGIC
D: Got a pretty good voice, though.
N: The ladies agree, leading Magic off to his room, where he follows them inside, shutting us out with the door as -- WE MONTAGE THROUGH SOME PRETTY DEBAUCHEROUS YEARS WHERE: Magic doinks two women in the Forum Club bathroom and -- He bones ANOTHER WOMAN at a Pool Party at his house and -- He balls ANOTHER WOMAN BACKSTAGE at a JACKSON FIVE SHOW and -- At the Playboy Mansion and Donald Sterling’s Malibu house and nn New York.

T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT. PAT RILEY’S OFFICE, FORUM CLUB - DAY
N: Riley, in his office overlooking the court, combing his hair.
C: PAT RILEY
D: We can’t have him burn out.
C: COOP
D: He’s the MVP of the league and we just won back to back titles. You want Magic to slow down?
C: PAT RILEY
D: There’s plenty of ways to burn out. I love Dr. Buss but --
C: COOP
D: I’m not getting in the middle of that. Coach, I hear your concern but -- Magic is fine.
E: MORE
C: COOP
D: The guy is a prince. My car’s in the shop, he lent me his for a month. I’m driving it right now. I wouldn’t change him one bit.
E: CONT'D
C: PAT RILEY
D: Nobody’s talking about change, I’m just saying be careful. You run an engine too hot, eventually they explode. He’s not actually Magic.
C: COOP
D: Are you sure of that, Pat?
N: Coop hangs up the phone and we end with him driving, enjoying the Beverly Hills air when -- BOOM! Out of nowhere, the hood of the car explodes in flames. Coop, understandably panics, trying to get the car off the road before he burns up inside it and --
S: INT. MAGIC JOHNSON’S NEW BEL AIR MANSION - MOMENTS LATER
N: Magic’s on the phone in his bathroom in a robe.
C: COOP
D: Man, I don’t know what happened. It just burst into flames.
C: MAGIC
D: Oh my god! Coop, that’s terrible. We’re you able to save the phone numbers I had in the glove box?
E: beat
T: INTERCUT NOW WITH:
S: EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
N: Coop, standing on a sidewalk, flocked with WASPY onlookers, carphone case in his hand, talking with Magic as FIRE FIGHTERS spray down Magic’s smoking Mercedes.
C: COOP
D: The numbers? Did you hear me? Your hundred thousand dollar car just blew up on the street -- I’m ok, by the way.
C: MAGIC
D: Yeah, I heard you. It’s cool. But can you go grab those numbers from the box? I got a girl I need to call. Coop, I can’t lose that number.
N: Coop stares off at the smoldering carcass of the car --
C: COOP
D: I’ll let you know where they take it. But Earvin, think you might need some help.
N: Coop hangs up the phone as this time we end on: Magic in his bedroom which we now see is occupied by SIX WOMEN, passed out on his bed. The sounds of a party, heard raging in the home all around him. Hold on Magic in this moment, maybe beginning to agree while -
S: EXT. BOSTON GARDEN - NIGHT
N: Back in Boston, Larry’s facing some hard truths as well. His back in a brace, he shuffles into the Garden beside M.L.
C: ML CARR
D: When they going to do one of me?
C: LARRY
D: Maybe when you get a jump shot.
N: M.L.’s referring to the famous WOODEN STATUE OF LARRY on exhibit outside the arena.
C: ML CARR
D: Motherfucker. At least I can jump. That thing moves better than you. They need to add a few pounds, they wanna make it more accurate.
N: Larry can’t argue with that and --
S: INT. BOSTON GARDEN - A FEW HOURS LATER
N: Larry battles MICHAEL JORDAN and the Bulls in the Garden, having a pretty bad night. Jordan, younger, ascendant, a different caliber of athlete, puts on a show while -- Larry, back breaking in pain, watches large stretches of the game from the bench. Well actually -- From the floor by the bench where he lays on his stomach, trying to soothe his bad spine. And when he gets in the game - CLANK! Larry puts up a brick, cursing his broken fingers, still mangled from that long ago bar brawl.
C: JORDAN
D: Thought you shot better than that.
N: Jordan takes the ball down and hits a J in Larry’s face.
C: JORDAN
D: Take that, All-Star.
E: CONT’D
C: LARRY
D: Come on, you little bitch. Bring it back here.
N: Summoning his resolve, Bird runs down the wing and drains a THREE in Jordan’s face. Jordan shakes his head.
C: JORDAN
D: Man, you’re the biggest prima donna I’ve ever seen.
C: BIRD
D: What the hell’s a prima donna?
N: Bird runs off past him, bumping Jordan’s shoulder, only we can see Larry’s hurting. He’s still got the talent and drive, but his body is failing. He can barely stand up.
C: DAN DYREK
D: You need surgery, Larry. It’s not gonna get better.
E: PRE-LAP
S: INT. DAN DYREK’S OFFICE - DAY
N: Larry sits in DAN DYREK’s PHYSICAL THERAPIST’S OFFICE. X-RAYS of his back on the screen. Red looks on at his side.
C: DAN DYREK
D: You’ve lost the structural stability in your spine so when you run. When you jump, it slips out of position and compresses your nerves. That’s like slamming your finger in a door, and somebody keeps shutting it harder.
C: LARRY
D: Well, good thing I can’t jump.
C: RED AUERBACH
D: Larry, this isn’t a joke.
C: DAN DYREK
D: Now there is therapy we can try to strengthen the supporting muscles, try and lock it in place, but it won’t last forever.
C: RED AUERBACH
D: How long you wanna go like this? You already did two Achilles.

N: As before. Red tries to talk sense to Larry.
C: RED AUERBACH
D: I told you before, if you don’t start to slow down -- you won’t walk out of this game on your own.
C: LARRY
D: And I told you -- I get paid for a job, I’m going to show up to work.
C: RED AUERBACH
D: Jesus, you’re stubborn.
C: LARRY
D: I’ll do the therapy, fine, but I’m not getting no surgery. I do that, it’s over. You go under the knife, you don’t come back the same.
C: RED AUERBACH
D: Everything ends eventually. What the hell’s left to prove?
N: Off Larry, who doesn’t quite have that answer and --
S: INT. LARRY’S BROOKLINE HOME - DAY
N: Larry lies on the floor, just like in the games, nursing his back while his NEW BABY BOY swats at a ball in his nursery. From the door, Dinah watches. Her heart, very full to see Larry, a father. But she knows he’s in pain and --

N: Larry’s still contemplative on the bus to a game, seated in the back beside Robert Parish, who’s got a smile on his face.
C: LARRY
D: What’s so funny there, Chief?
C: ROBERT PARISH
D: Nothing. Just thinking. You believe we get to do this? Get paid to play basketball? Sometimes, I just --

A heated shit talking battle when -- Larry, with the ball at the top of the key -- has it knocked away by a defender. A mad scramble for the ball! Larry dives to the ground after it and -- BANG! His head hits the floor hard, face smashing off the parquet with a sickened CRACK that takes the air from the Garden. The play continues around him but Larry lies on the floor, unmoving. Unconscious. The crowd silent in shock and -- A FEW BREATHLESS MINUTES LATER Dinah and the fans are in tears when Larry finally rises, staggering into the tunnel, knocked out for the count and --
C: DOCTOR

D: And here comes Larry Bird! And not a moment too soon, with Indiana leading by two.
E: V.O.
N: The moment is iconic. The Boston fans roar as Larry takes a knee in front of the bench, itching to get back in the game. The standing ovation washes over him. The emotion is incredible. Even Larry can feel it. He retakes the court, walks right up to Chuck Person.
C: LARRY
D: I’m gonna fucking put you in the ground.
N: Person is speechless, but there’s no doubt that he’ll do it. We don’t even need to see the game because --
S: INT. CELTICS’ LOCKER ROOM - AN HOUR LATER
N: It’s over. The Celtics celebrating an unbelievable comeback victory in the locker room, slapping Larry on the back. He makes his way over to Red, absolutely exhausted. In agony.
C: RED AUERBACH
D: You had 17 points in the fourth. If there was any debate about the best I’ve ever seen -- kid, you’re it.
C: LARRY
D: Woulda had twenty, hadn’t missed that one three.
C: RED AUERBACH
D: Son, that’s how you finish something. Remember this one.
N: Larry’s emotional at the words.
C: LARRY
D: When the season’s over, I’ll do it. Tell Doc to set up the surgery.
N: Both men know what this means. They take a long moment and then Larry Bird finally sits down as --
C: ANNOUNCER
D: And there he goes again. Kevin Johnson goes right by Bryon Scott.
E: V.O.
S: INT. PHOENIX SUNS ARENA - NIGHT
N: Tiny, flat-topped, KEVIN JOHNSON takes Bryon to the hole. The Phoenix crowd’s on their feet. Pat Riley’s apoplectic as -- A TITLE CARD READS: WESTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINALS GAME 4 - PHOENIX LEADS L.A. 2 - 1 And it goes on like this.

C: ANNOUNCER
D: Kevin Johnson, again penetrating. Puts a jumper off the glass!
E: V.O.

C: PAT RILEY
D: You let Kevin-fucking-midget-ass- Johnson walk down the lane like he’s the Dali-fucking-Lama. You didn’t play any defense!
N: No one even reacts. Which makes Riley even madder.
C: PAT RILEY
D: What? You don’t care? Worthy, you’re fucking forcing up everything. Thompson, I don’t know what to say. You’re just a goddamn loser who belongs on a fucking loser team. You played like pussies. You don’t have any balls! Do you!? Do you? Cause you need ‘em? I got ‘em. Buck’s got ‘em! I’ve seen ‘em but the rest of you pussies -- the only guy who did anything on this whole sorry team is Buck, and we wasted 43 points and you guys don’t even care!
E: CONT’D
N: Despite all his theatrics, it appears that they don’t. Just continuing to pack up, never acknowledging the tirade and -- Riley knows what this means. He’s lost them. He heads off to bathroom, considering his hair in the mirror in a moment of anguish and then -- WHAM! He punches the glass, shattering his reflection into a thousand fragmented pieces, ripping open his hand. Magic turns at the sound, seeing Riley, bleeding badly all over his custom-made sharkskin suit. He storms out the door. Magic watches him go. No one saying a word and --
S: EXT. LAKERS’ TEAM BUS - LATER (MOVING)

C: MAGIC
D: You can’t eat tacos at a bullfight? You know where the meat comes from don’t you?
C: DR. BUSS
D: Why you never stop running. Ole!

N: -- where Larry, still rehabbing from back surgery, sleeps on the ground in a FIBERGLASS BRACE. Dinah (with their baby in her arms) answers the phone.
C: DINAH
D: Hello? It’s Dinah. Larry’s taking a nap. Can he call you back later? Ok. Hang on. One sec.
E: her face falls
N: Appropriately worried, Dinah goes to rouse Larry.
C: DINAH
D: Hey, honey. Wake up. Think you need to get up. It’s your agent.
E: CONT’D
N: Slowly, Larry rises. The pain he’s in is tremendous.
C: LARRY
D: I hate this damn thing. Makes me feel like a mummy.
N: They share a sweet kiss as Larry hobbles to the phone.
C: LARRY
D: This better be good. You woke me up from a nap. They want another commercial?
E: CONT’D
C: BOB WOLF
D: No, Larry, they don’t. This isn’t going to be easy so I’m just going to tell you cause we don’t have much time. Magic’s retiring today. He’s got HIV. There’s going to be an announcement. He wanted you to know before the word hit the news.
E: FILTERED beat
N: Larry -- just staggered. Dinah watches him, scared.
C: LARRY
D: What I can I do? What’s he need?
C: BOB WOLF
D: He’s ok. Just hang tight. He’ll call in a few days.
E: FILTERED
C: LARRY
D: No. I need to talk him now. It can’t wait a few days.
E: just panicked
C: BOB WOLF
D: I don’t know if you can. He’s got a press conference in an hour, but you can try him at home.
E: FILTERED
N: Larry hangs up the phone, immediately dialing again.
C: DINAH
D: Larry, hey - what’s going on?
N: But he can’t find the words, frantically dialing the phone as-
T: WE INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT. MAGIC'S BEL AIR MANSION - SAME
N: Magic, in his palatial closet, trying to find a suit to wear to the worst moment of his career when Cookie arrives.
C: COOKIE
D: What do you think of this blue? I was thinking something optimistic, you know. Show people I’m fine.
E: of the suits
C: COOKIE
D: Earvin, Larry just called. Want me to tell him, talk later?
E: CONT’D
N: Magic’s surprised. Even touched a little bit and -- A FEW SECONDS LATER He picks up the phone, trying to put on a smile.
C: MAGIC
D: Hey Larry, what’s cooking?
C: LARRY
D: Magic, man, I’m so sorry. Just tell me what I can do.
C: MAGIC
D: You don’t have to do anything. It’s all going to be fine. We just got Cookie tested. She’s healthy so there’s really no worry. What I want to know is how you feeling, Larry? Seen you wearing that corset. You look like an old man.
C: LARRY
D: Yeah, I feel like one too.
N: In spite of the circumstances, Larry and Magic both laugh. But then they fall into silence. Larry’s getting choked up.
C: LARRY
D: You don’t quit on me, Earvin.
E: CONT’D
C: MAGIC
D: Don’t have much of a choice. Docs say I gotta retire --
C: LARRY
D: I’m not talking about that. Just don’t quit on me, got it?
N: Magic understands Larry’s fear.
C: MAGIC
D: I gotta run. Thanks for calling. But don’t you worry. I don’t quit.
N: Magic hangs up, quite moved, as we end on: Larry, setting down the receiver. Dinah waits for the news.
C: LARRY
D: You believe this guy? He’s trying to cheer me up.
C: DINAH
D: Maybe it means he can beat it.
C: LARRY
D: You heard of someone who has?
N: Dinah’s got no response and Larry’s clearly terrified as --
S: INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
N: Magic, in his suit, rides with Cookie to the Forum. They may as well be in a hearse. Magic’s understandably heavy as -- Like many years before, L.A.’s sights shine out the window. Magic views them, nostalgic, passing a bright row of ORANGE TREES on a Beverly Hills Lawn. He considers them, sadly. His beginning. Now his end as --
S: INT. FORUM - NIGHT
N: Cookie waits alone in a hallway outside the locker room in her “optimistic” white suit. Putting on a brave face as -- The LAKERS all file out -- having just heard the news. Grown men just in tears who can’t meet Cookie’s eyes. She waits for the long, funeral procession to end until Earvin finally appears in the door. Cookie takes him by the hand and they now make their way to --
S: INT. FORUM CLUB - NIGHT
N: The holy of holies. Magic enters the club, not for a party, but a press conference. The famously private, no cameras allowed, club is now jammed with REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS and NBA ROYALTY while --
S: INT. LARRY BIRD'S BROOKLINE HOME - SAME
N: Larry and Dinah watch on TV as Magic takes his place at the podium. Cookie’s beside him. Dr. Buss, weeping openly. DAVID STERN, JERRY WEST, DR. Mellman, Coop and Kareem take seats on both sides. It looks like The Last Supper. Magic waits at the mic. A long beat of silence. Putting on a big smile as the cameras keep flashing. Finally --
C: MAGIC
D: “First of all, let me say good after -- good after late afternoon. Because of the uh -- the HIV virus that I have attained, I will have to retire from the Lakers today.”
E: ON TV
N: The words take Larry’s wind and --
S: INT. FORUM CLUB - SAME
N: Magic adjusts the mic as the news hits the room.
C: MAGIC
D: “I just want to make clear, first of all, that I do not have the AIDS disease -- 'cause I know a lot of you are -- want to know that -- but the HIV virus. My wife is fine. She's negative, so there's no problem with her. I plan on going on, living for a long time, bugging you guys, like I've have so -- you'll see me around. Obviously, I'm going to miss playing, but I will now become a spokesman for the HIV virus because I want people -- young people to realize that they can practice safe sex. And you know sometimes you're a little naive about it and you think it could never happen to you. You only thought it could happen to, you know, other people and so on and all but... I'm going to deal with it and my life will go on. And I will be here, enjoying the Laker games, and all the other NBA games around the country. So, life is going to go on for me, and I'm going to be a happy man.”
N: The effort to hope is gut-wrenching. The room is dead silent.
C: MAGIC
D: “I want to thank everybody up here, as well as my teammates, because they've been behind me all the way. I want to thank Kareem for coming out, him and "Coop" who -- who stood side by side and won a lot of battles. I want to thank also Jerry West for all he's done. Dr. Kerr. Dr. Mellman -- he will tell you who my other doctors are that have helped me through this -- as well as, like I said, my father, in a sense, Dr. Jerry Buss, for just drafting me and me being here.”
E: CONT’D
N: Dr. Buss almost faints. Cookie gives him a hand.
C: MAGIC
D: “Now, of course, I will miss the battles and the wars, and I will miss you guys. But life goes on... This is not like my life is over, cause it’s not. I’m gonna live on. This is another challenge. It’s another chapter in my life. It’s like being -- like your back’s against the wall but I think you just have to come out swinging. And I’m swinging so -- I am going to go on. I’m gonna beat it so uhm, thank you again. And I’ll see you soon.”
E: CONT’D
N: And with that, while reporters bomb questions, Magic hands over the mic, stepping away from the podium as --
S: INT. LARRY BIRD'S BROOKLINE HOME - SAME
N: Larry watches through tears the unbelievable -- and here before never seen -- sight of Magic vacating the stage though a black curtain behind it. Walking away from the spotlight. Larry watches, just gutted. He can’t even move and --
S: INT. BOSTON GARDEN - (THE VERY NEXT) NIGHT
N: Before a game against the HAWKS, Larry’s still overcome. He stands for the ANTHEM, unable to contain his emotions and -- For just the second time in his life, Larry does not want to play ball. We see this during the game as -- A FEW MINUTES LATER Larry runs on the court, but he plays in a fog. No passion. No love. Like he’s underwater and can’t come up for air, but - In one moment of grace, with back broken and all, Larry pushes the ball on the break, approaching mid court when -- From out of nowhere, he throws a fifty foot, behind the back dime to a streaking REGGIE LEWIS who throws it down a dunk and for a moment we --
T: FLASH CUT TO:
N: YOUNG MAGIC -- in his prime on a break, splitting the defense in style, throwing the same behind the back dime as we --
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: LARRY, hobbling back on defense, understanding this was a tribute to Magic. It’s incredibly painful and --
S: EXT. LOCKER ROOM, BOSTON GARDEN - AFTER THE GAME
N: Larry (in a bad Cosby sweater) is mobbed by reporters at his locker. He is very subdued.
C: MUSBERGER
D: How did you feel out there, Larry? We know how your back’s been, but tonight it seem like you were playing with heavy heart?
C: LARRY
D: “No doubt about it. I was. Probably the two toughest days I’ve had since my father passed away and -- I’ve been very depressed and sort of been out of it. You know, just out of the blue, something like that happening, it’s just -- I’ve never, other than one other instance, and I was hoping I’d never see that again cause I remember how I felt, weeks after that and yesterday was just a -- a sad day.”
N: We linger on Larry, trying to hold in his pain, but for once, he’s unable to and --
S: INT. LARRY BIRD'S BROOKLINE BOSTON HOME - NIGHT
N: When he gets home to Dinah, he goes immediately for a beer.
C: LARRY
D: All these years, me and him, we’ve been linked. It’s like I knew he was out there -- working hard, getting better. I had to get better too. But if Magic ain’t there -- This competition is just --
E: beat
C: DINAH
D: It’s not all about competition. He’s your friend and you’re scared.
N: Larry sits downs. Still fighting.
C: LARRY
D: After my dad died, I put it all into winning - but every time, there was Magic. I figured I could beat him then, I could maybe move on, put all that in the past but -- if he’s not there anymore, I don’t know how to do it.
C: DINAH
D: Maybe you don’t have to fight him. Maybe you just let him in. Just be there as a friend.
C: LARRY
D: And what about if he’s gone?
N: Dinah puts her hand on his back as Larry Bird finally cries.
C: DAMON WAYANS
D: No, I love living in L.A. It’s the best place in the world.
E: PRELAP
S: INT. COMEDY STORE - NIGHT
N: Trying to enjoy a night out, Magic sits with Cookie VIP at the comedy club, watching DAMON WAYANS performing on stage.
C: WAYANS
D: Basketball season is back. They say Magic might come back to help out the Lakers. That’d be nice right?
N: Magic smiles. Cookie tenses. Damon doesn’t know they’re here.
C: WAYANS
D: You know what Magic stands for don’t you? “My - Ass - Got - Infected - Coach.”
E: CONT’D
N: On Magic. Trying to laugh the joke off. It gets worse.
C: WAYANS
D: I wonder if a lot of the players don’t wanna play with Magic now. He’s all sweaty and shit, they gotta body him up in fucking Hazmat suits and shit. Be like -- Oop, damn. Couldn’t get that Magic. Right by me, man. Damn. Hey coach, that’s Magic. I can’t check Magic.
E: CONT’D let’s a player drive by
N: The crowd laughs. Cookie can see Magic’s hurt. She tries to get him to leave, but Magic won’t move. He endures it.
C: WAYANS
D: You see the All Star game. The only person in the league wanna d-Magic up is Dennis Rodman and he’s up on his ass like -- Boom! Knocks him to the ground. Be like “Look? I’m not scared of Magic. I’m fucking everybody. I don’t know what the fuck I got. Y’all oughta be scared of me!
E: CONT’D bodies him up hard
N: The crowd is in stitches. Cookie fights tears. Magic puts on a good face, but he’s cut to the bone and --
S: INT. MAGIC'S BEL AIR MANSION - DAY
N: The next day, Cookie’s surprised when she comes into the bedroom to find Magic lacing his sneakers.
C: COOKIE
D: Where you going?
C: MAGIC
D: To the gym. Wanna say hey to the guys. Shoot around for a bit. I’ll take it easy. Don’t worry.
N: That’s not Cookie’s concern. He kisses her as he goes and --
S: EXT. FORUM - DAY
N: Just like the old times, A MARQUEE ANNOUNCES TONIGHT’S GAME: LAKERS VS. PISTONS. FANS wait at the players’ gate clamoring for autographs when Magic steps out of his Mercedes, thrilled to be back in his element. He puts on a big smile, ready to greet all his fans - But, to Magic’s dismay, the crowd parts when he enters. They don’t beg for his autographs or clamor for pictures. They back away like he’s toxic and won’t meet his eyes. Magic heads through them, destroyed and --
S: INT. FORUM - DAY
N: -- when he enters his old home, saying HI to the PRESS, giving high fives to the STAFF, this time, the mood’s grave. A REPORTER reluctantly takes a high-five. Then wipes his hand on his pants as Magic passes along. It’s devastating to see. A dead man walking.
S: INT. COURT, FORUM - MOMENTS LATER
N: It’s even worse on the court. Magic’s former teammates warm- up in the empty arena when Magic, in practice gear, steps onto the court. The record scratches. A long beat.
C: COACH DUNLEAVY
D: How’s it going there, Magic?
C: MAGIC
D: Yeah, it’s going real good. Just wanted come and work out. See if you needed a hand. I could pretend to be Isaiah.
N: Magic does an Isaiah impersonation. A few awkward laughs. But he doesn’t get any takers.
C: MAGIC
D: Hey James, how about you? Wanna run one-on-one?
E: CONT’D
C: JAMES WORTHY
D: Uh -- maybe later. That cool? I wanna work on my free throws.
C: MAGIC
D: Ok. Go ahead. A.C. How bout you?
C: A.C.
D: Just about to go get taped up.
C: MAGIC
D: OK. Cool. Anybody wants a game, I’ll be right over here. ‘Less y’all just don’t wanna get beat.
N: Magic, keeping his head high, dribbles to another basket and begins hoisting up shots. The few players there take their balls and move to another rim, leaving Magic alone. It’s a very sad sight, but Magic tries to shoot through it. Finally, Bryon Scott comes over, shaking his head in disappointment with his teammates’ behavior.
C: BYRON SCOTT
D: You want someone to rebound?
C: MAGIC
D: What’s going on with the guys?
E: appreciating the gesture
C: BYRON SCOTT
D: Man, they’re just scared. A lot of the guys, they don’t know what to say. And a lot of the others, just afraid that they’ll catch it.
C: MAGIC
D: You know it don’t work like that right?
C: BYRON SCOTT
D: Of course man, I know. But half of ‘em just went out and got tested themselves. They’ll come around. Give ‘em time. They just don’t want to die. Man, that’s not what I meant.
E: beat. He feels terrible
C: MAGIC
D: I’m not going to die. I feel fine.
N: Byron wants to believe that, but it sounds like blind hope.
C: BYRON SCOTT
D: Just give the brothers some time. It’s a lot to take in. Plus, with what Isiah’s being say --
C: MAGIC
D: What do you mean? What’d he say?
C: BYRON SCOTT
D: Oh shit. You haven’t heard?
N: Off Magic, he hasn’t. But he’s about to find out and --
S: INT. VISITOR'S LOCKER ROOM - FORUM - LATER
N: Isaiah Thomas is buttoning up his warm-ups, joking around with his teammates as they exit the tunnel when Magic appears. Still wearing in his warm-ups.
C: ISAIAH
D: Hey Magic. Uh-oh. You making comeback already?
C: MAGIC
D: You been calling my agent?
C: ISAIAH
D: I been calling who what?
C: MAGIC
D: You call Lou Rosen, I said? Say you heard I was gay?
C: ISAIAH
D: Did I what? Are you crazy? C’mon. I got a game.
N: He tries laughing this off, but Magic won’t let it pass.
C: MAGIC
D: I heard you been going around, asking what’s going on. You saying, that isn’t true?
N: Isaiah finally stops, caught. He lets down his pretense.
C: MAGIC
D: What the fuck, bro? I thought we were boys. You know me better than anyone. We vacation together. You had a key to my house.
E: CONT’D
C: ISAIAH
D: I don’t know what you do out here in Hollywood when I’m not around. You out with Dr. Buss and Arsenio. I don’t know what you get into.
C: MAGIC
D: You really think that I’m gay? Your friend gets this news and that’s where you go first? Not, is he ok? Not, let me call Earvin? No. Instead you go around, telling the world that I’m gay. You’re only worried about you. You afraid what they’ll say cause we used to kiss before games.
E: Isaiah is silent Isaiah doesn’t deny it
N: Isaiah doesn’t deny it. He shows no emotion.
C: ISAIAH
D: I didn’t live your life, Magic. Whatever you did, whoever you did it with, guess you gotta live with it now. I’m sorry. I am. I gotta run. Got a game. You give my love to Cookie.
E: beat
C: MAGIC
D: Hope you break a leg asshole.
C: ISAIAH
D: You reap what you sew.
N: Isaiah walks off with smirk, leaving Magic in the tunnel. Backstage and alone. Listening the roar of the crowd. The spotlight shinning without him and --
S: INT. MAGIC'S BEL AIR MANSION - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Magic’s awake in the dark, watching a VHS on his TV. The tape’s of a game he’s returned to many times in his life. 1980. Game 6. The NBA Finals when a 20 year-old Magic played the game of his life and cemented his stardom. Magic watches, bittersweet. 40 points. 15 boards. 7 assists. Twelve years ago. Much as changed since then. But what has not is Magic’s drive to win. To excel. To survive. We see it in his face and --
C: MARK BIRD
D: He really asked you to come?
E: PRELAP
S: EXT. LAKE, FRENCH LICK - DAY
N: Larry is fishing on a boat with Mark. It’s peaceful, but a tough gig for Larry, still wearing the fucking BACK-BRACE.
C: MARK BIRD
D: Can you fly with your back?
C: LARRY
D: I’ll be sitting on a plane. I don’t have flap there myself.
C: MARK BIRD
D: Way you’re fishing, might need to. You couldn’t catch a flight.
C: LARRY
D: Ain’t seen you catch anything either.
C: MARK BIRD
D: Didn’t wanna make you feel bad. Just wait, cause it’s coming.
N: They could do this all day. Two brothers, talking shit.
C: MARK BIRD
D: Well I’m proud that you’re going. Sure it means a lot. Not a lot of people in his corner right now.
E: CONT’D
C: LARRY
D: I know he’d do it for me.
C: MARK BIRD
D: Bet he would. They ever retire your jersey, they’ll have to hang that thing too. It did half the work.
N: He’s talking about the back brace.
C: LARRY
D: When I’m done this, I’m gonna blow it half. Can’t run anymore, but I can still fucking shoot.
N: Larry mimes a shotgun. Off the Bird brothers’ laugh...
S: EXT. FORUM - NIGHT (ESTABLISHING)
N: Another sparkling night. Showtime in L.A. where --
S: INT. FORUM - THAT MOMENT
N: Larry (in a suit) walks through the now familiar tunnels, catching some heckles from the good natured staff.
C: STAFF
D: Hey Larry, Boston sucks!
C: LARRY
D: You guys aren’t real good either.
N: The staff laughs. So does Larry. Dr. Buss warmly approaches.
C: DR. BUSS
D: Thanks for coming. Means the world. Know it’s hard to travel right now.
C: LARRY
D: That’s all right. Wouldn’t miss it.
C: DR. BUSS
D: Well, come on. Earvin’s waiting. Wanted to talk with you before.
N: Dr. Buss doesn’t say about what. Just leads Larry off into --
S: INT. FORUM CLUB - NIGHT
N: The once raucous club. Now eerily silent. Larry enters to see Magic sitting alone in a booth in a chocolate brown suit. The two men take a moment, both clearly torn up.
C: MAGIC
D: Thanks for coming.
C: LARRY
D: Are you kidding? Get to see you retire? I’ve been waiting 12 years. Wish I was playing tonight. Think I’d probably drop sixty.
C: MAGIC
D: Yeah. Bet you could. Bet you would.
N: Magic gets up and they hug. A long time. Emotional.
C: LARRY
D: Don’t get all sentimental on me. You still look pretty good too. Could probably get twenty at least.
C: MAGIC
D: You really think? Well, that’s good. Cause that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about.
N: Larry drops the embrace, wary of Magic’s sly smile and -- A FEW MINUTES LATER They are sitting in the booth. Magic’s laid out his plan.
C: MAGIC
D: You gotta come, Larry. I need this. Michael’s going to play. I talked to Charles and Patrick.
E: CONT’D
C: LARRY
D: Didn’t talk to Laimbeer, did you? I’d hate to see him on the bus, saying “Hi Larry,” and me have to say, “Fuck you, Bill.”
N: Magic laughs.
C: MAGIC
D: It’s called The Dream Team, Larry. It’s the greatest team ever. We didn’t call Bill Laimbeer. We need you, Larry Bird.
C: LARRY
D: Earvin, my back is so broke, I can hardly get out of bed. I can’t run with you guys.
C: MAGIC
D: I don’t need you to run. I need you there as a friend. I need to prove I still got it. But I can’t do it without you. With no Bird, there’s no Magic.
E: beat
N: Larry is silent. And moved. He takes a long beat.
C: MAGIC
D: If it makes a difference, I’ll ask, but I don’t think they’ll move the Olympics to French Lick.
E: CONT’D
C: LARRY
D: Is Isaiah gonna be there?
N: Magic shakes his head, gleefully.
C: MAGIC
D: You reap what you sew. So what’s it going to be, Larry? You ready to be on my team?

E: PRELAP
S: INT. FORUM - A FEW HOURS LATER

D: Their spirited rivalry peaked of course in their three meetings in the NBA finals.
N: Reveal Larry, sitting on the Lakers court, waiting to rise --
C: CHUCK HEARN

C: LARRY
D: Earvin “Magic” Johnson. The respect you have earned through out the NBA for your outstanding and unique play was never more evident than between the intense rivalry between the Lakers and The Celtics. This piece of Boston Garden Parquet symbolizes your place in the hearts and minds of Celtics fans everywhere. You never wore the green and white, but you’ll always be a part of our family. Magic...
E: CONT’D Larry holds a gift
N: Larry hands Magic the commemorative gift and the two rivals hug. And outside of the reach of the microphones --
C: MAGIC
D: Thank you.
E: whispers
N: Larry’s moved so he takes the mic back, returns to the crowd.
C: LARRY
D: And he’s not done yet because we’re going to go to Barcelona and bring back the gold for everyone here in the United States.
N: That brings the crowd to their feet and a smile to Magic. The friends shake hands. United. Applause washes over them as -- A MUSIC CUE STARTS, taking us through -- A VICTORY LAP OF A MONTAGE: THE DREAM TEAM For the first time in 14 years, Larry and Magic are on the same team. They sit next to each other on the bus, taking in the historic sights of Barcelona. - They take pictures with FANS in TOURIST SIGHTS in the city. - They practice together in their USA JERSEYS along with Jordan and Ewing. Clyde and Malone. Magic running the show. Larry (and his broken back) shooting threes on the sidelines. - They laugh side by side at the dias during pressers and goof in the locker-room, looking at Larry’s mangled fingers, still crooked from the bar fight. - They drink beers, talking shit, smoking cigars, betting games of pool in the hotel with Jordan and of course... - At the games, they sit side by side on the bench. No longer eager young studs waiting for their chance to compete, but basketball legends here for the love of the game and -- - On the court, Magic shows the world that he still has the goods. On a flashy fast break, Magic jukes a CANADIAN PLAYER out of his jock, dancing in for a lay-up and -- - While Larry’s back keep him laying down on the sidelines during most of the games, he talks shit while he does it, cracking up Magic, Jordan, and Ewing until finally -- - CHUCK DALEY (the Coach) signals Larry into the game. He peels himself off the floor. Checking in next to Magic.
C: MAGIC
D: Wanna show these fools something?
N: Larry laughs at the call back and when they get in the game, Magic seeks Larry out, trying to get him his shots.
C: MAGIC
D: Larry!
E: CONT’D
N: Magic feeds him for a three, which Larry buries and... - One another possession, Magic drives down the lane, dishing over his shoulder to Larry at the wing for a three that he nails and the teammates high five and for a moment we -- FLASHBACK TO: 1978: THE JUNIOR USA TEAM.

C: MAGIC
D: So is this really it?
C: LARRY
D: Oh yeah. This is it. How ‘bout you? You look sharp.
C: MAGIC
D: Yeah. I feel pretty good. Still got a some gas in the tank. Maybe I’ll run it all back. Can’t let Michael have all the fun.
C: LARRY
D: Who the hell’s out here for fun?
N: They laugh. Larry grabs Magic’s jersey. Hands him a marker.
C: LARRY
D: Wanna sign this thing for me?
E: CONT’D
C: MAGIC
D: You gonna sign one for me?
N: Larry signs his. The two old rivals exchange jerseys and --
S: INT. BARCELONA ARENA - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
N: Larry and Magic step off the elevator, heading toward the lobby to exit the arena. In the distance, they can see a CROWD OF FANS and REPORTERS outside by the TEAM BUS, waiting for a glimpse of the stars. Larry slows up. Starts to turn.
C: LARRY
D: You know, I talked to this guy. There’s a side door over here. You don’t have to mess with all that. We can slip out the back.
N: Magic gives him a smile.
C: MAGIC
D: Thought I told you before. I don’t go out the side door.
N: Some things never change. He and Larry slap hands. A final goodbye. And then Larry is gone, disappearing out a quiet backdoor. Into the sunset, alone as -- Magic watches him go, grateful and moved, before he turns to the entrance, lights up his bright smile, and steps through the doors into the arms of his fans as we --
T: FADE TO BLACK.
