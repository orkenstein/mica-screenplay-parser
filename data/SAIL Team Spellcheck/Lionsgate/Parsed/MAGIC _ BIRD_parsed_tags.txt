0: 
N: Seated on the bench, watching the game pass them by, are:
N: LARRY BIRD (21) and EARVIN “MAGIC” JOHNSON (19).
0: 
N: Larry, of course, is the tall, white, bowl cut, acne-scarred,
N: porn stashed, backwoods, “Hick from French Lick” and --
0: 
N: Magic, obviously, is the black, 6’9”, megawatt supernova with
N: a Hollywood smile and talent and charisma to burn.
0: 
N: Quite a pair. Both disgruntled, unused to riding the pin.

C:                      MAGIC (CONT’D)
D:            Every time coach takes us out,
D:            these cats start coming back. What
D:            the fuck is he doing?
0: 
C:                      LARRY
D:            He don’t care about us. Just wants
D:            to work out his guys. Couldn’t pay
D:            me to play for Coach Hall at UK.
0: 
C:                      MAGIC
D:            Yeah? What’d he do to you?

C:                      LARRY
D:            Told my high school coach I was too

0: 
N: They watch the game on the court. It’s not quite 1950’s, set-
N: shot, white ball, but it’s not too far off.
0: 
C:                     LARRY (CONT’D)
D:           He wouldn’t know an ace player if
D:           one punched him in the face.
0: 
N: That gets a laugh out of Magic when --
0: 
C:                     COACH HALL
D:           Come on! Bird. Johnson. Get in.
0: 
N: COACH JOHN B. HALL (40’s), the asshole is question, waves our
N: two heroes in. Magic turns to Larry at the scorer’s table.
0: 
C:                     MAGIC
D:           Wanna show this fool something?
0: 
N: Magic flashes a smile as they’re buzzed into the game and
N: what happens next is the stuff of basketball legend. The
N: black and white game suddenly jumps into color.
0: 
N: They are on defense at first and when a Russian shot bricks,
N: Larry snags the rebound one handed, firing on an overhand
N: bullet all the way down to court that hits Magic in stride
N: for a break-away dunk that gets the crowd on their feet.
0: 
N: Magic’s chance next. He pushes the pace on the break, drawing
N: three defenders at once, tripping all over each other when --
0: 
N: Magic fires a no-look missile to Larry cutting down for a
N: layup that leaves the Ruskie's on skates and --
0: 
N: When they run the break together, it’s lightning in a bottle.
0: 
N: Magic drives past three defenders, flying down the left
N: block, dropping a no-look dime over his shoulder to --
0: 
N: Larry, cutting hard down the lane. It’s only on his hands for
N: an instant, drawing the last two defenders before --
0: 
N: He dishes it no-look back to Magic for a wide open lay-up and
N: the CROWD goes berserk. So does Magic. Pure joy. He gives
N: Bird a high-five. A taste of what could have been. But the
N: moment is fleeting and --
0: 
N: A SHORT WHILE LATER
0: 
N: It’s over. The US has won. The teams shaking hands as the
N: MEDIA descends, trying to wrangle the stars.

E:               (looking over crowds)
D:           Where the hell did he go?
0: 
N: Because Larry’s already leaving, slipping off the court, out
N: of the glare of the spotlights. Magic can’t comprehend.

C:                     MAGIC (CONT’D)
D:           Well, I guess it’s just me.

S: EXT. FRENCH LICK STREETS - MORNING

N: A GARBAGE TRUCK rumbling down an impoverished dirt road in a
N: poor, rural farming town of 8,000 people that makes Hoosiers
N: look like it was shot in Manhattan.
0: 
N: TITLE CARD READS:   FRENCH LICK, INDIANA
0: 
N: We follow the truck, rumbling past abandoned farms and two
N: room clapboard houses. A worker hanging on the back.
0: 
N: It’s Larry Bird (19), wearing a STREET DEPT. UNIFORM like
N: Martin Sheen in Badlands. When the truck stops at a house --
0: 
N: Larry hops off and heaves trash into the back of the truck
N: with his friend, KEVIN KEARNS (20). Hard, backbreaking work

N: tracks and then heads through the door into --

N: Larry enters to find his grandmother, LIZZIE KEARNS, opening

C:                     LARRY
D:           What do you want me to say? I told

D:           school. I’m too happy right here.
D:           That way I get to see you.

N: Larry gives her a kiss, heading into his stark, fastidiously
N: clean bedroom to retrieve his basketball gear when --

N: He pauses for a moment, noticing a PHOTOGRAPH IN THE ROOM:

N: A buzzed-cut young Larry posing proudly with his father, JOE
N: BIRD. A Johnny Cash look-alike, only taller and tougher.
0: 
N: Larry regards it for a moment, until A CAR HONKS outside,
N: breaking his reverie. He heads back out the door.

C:                     LIZZIE
D:           Don’t come home, you don’t win.

C:                     LARRY
D:           Don’t start in on me too. You came

0: 
C:                     MARK
D:           Yeah, only difference, I finished.
D:           I don’t know if you heard, but it
D:           takes more than 10 days.
0: 
C:                     LARRY
D:           That true? I’ll be damned. Why
D:           didn’t somebody tell me?
0: 
N: The brothers laugh. Always bullshitting.

C:                     LARRY (CONT’D)

N: Mark’s car finally arrives in a lot packed with pick-ups and
N: Chevy’s for an AAU Game. The biggest show in a small town.
0: 
N: Before Mark’s even parked, Larry runs for the doors into -
0: 
0: 
S: INT. WEST BADEN HIGH SCHOOL GYM - THAT MOMENT
0: 
N: A packed gym. Right out of Hoosiers. On court, a local AAU
N: TEAM getting their asses smacked by an INDIANA ALL-STAR TEAM.
0: 
C:                     CROWD
D:           Goddamn it! C’mon!
0: 
N: The whole town is here. EIGHT HUNDRED WORKING CLASS LOCALS,
N: fed-up with their team. The only hint of outsiders --
0: 
N: TWO SHARP DRESSERS IN SUITS sitting apart in the stands. In a
N: beat, we’ll learn they’re:
0: 
N: INDIANA STATE HEAD COACH, BOB KING and more importantly, his
N: assistant, BILL HODGES (35, kind, and plain spoken.)
0: 
C:                     BOB KING
D:           This is a waste of my time. Where
D:           the hell is this kid?

C:                     BILL HODGES
D:           His mom said he would be here. Just
D:           hold on. Here he comes!
0: 
N: The whole crowd starts to buzz as Larry enters the gym,
N: hurrying over to his bench and his coach.
0: 
C:                     LARRY
D:           Sorry I’m late. Had to wait for a
D:           ride.
0: 
C:                     AAU COACH
D:           Do you need to warm up or...?

C:                     LARRY
D:           No. I’m ready. Let’s go.
0: 
N: Larry heads to the scorers table, wiping the bottom of his
N: shoes with the palms of his hands in a ritual of his.
0: 
C:                     BOB KING
D:           That’s your white knight? Kid looks
D:           like a scarecrow. No wonder he did
D:           not last two weeks with Bob Knight.
D:           Can he even get off the floor?
0: 
C:                     BILL HODGES
D:           Just wait and you’ll see.
0: 
N: He won’t have to wait long, because as soon as Larry checks
N: in the game, King’s skepticism is vanquished.
0: 
N: On the very first play, Larry picks the shifty POINT GUARD’S
N: pocket and takes it in for a left handed lay-up.
0: 
N: Hodges gives his head coach a look as --
0: 
S: OVER THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF QUARTERS:
0: 
N: Larry puts on a display that leaves jaws on the floor.
0: 
N: He runs power-point, dropping behind the back dimes. He
N: crashes the boards with a stunning sixth sense. He dives
N: after lose balls and shit talks bigger players and --
0: 
N: Of course, Larry drops j’s from such ingenious angles that --
0: 
N: Bob King is left gawking. Watching a savant playing chess
N: when everyone else’s playing checkers. He turns to Hodges.
0: 
C:                     BOB KING
D:           Why isn’t this kid in college?
D:           We need to get him to Terre Haute.

S: EXT. POOL HALL, WEST BADEN - LATER THAT NIGHT
0: 
N: Larry and Kearns play pool in a grim little joint that looks
N: out of THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. Mark is there too, all drinking
N: beers, watching Larry line up a tough shot on the eight ball.
0: 
C:                     LARRY
D:           I’ll bet you five bucks I’m gonna
D:           pocket this.

C:                     KEARNS
D:           Five bucks? Let me see it.
0: 
C:                     LARRY
D:           Well, I don’t got it on me. But
D:           Shorty still owes me for sweeping
D:           last week. Hey Shorty, you got me?
0: 
N: Larry calls out to the owner, SHORTY READER (50’s) a little
N: person. Under five feet. A great guy but he shakes his head.
0: 
C:                     KEARNS
D:           Bet’s off. There you go.

C:                     BILL HODGES (O.S.)
D:           I can spot you five bucks.
0: 
N: They all turn, surprised, to see Bill Hodges in the door.
0: 
C:                     BILL HODGES (CONT’D)
D:           You play like you did tonight,
D:           don’t see how I could lose. And you
D:           weren’t tired, or nothing.
0: 
C:                     LARRY
D:           Why’d I be tired against them?
0: 
C:                     BILL HODGES
D:           Saw those scrapes on your arm. You
D:           been putting up hay?
0: 
N: Larry looks at his arms, surprised at Hodges’ insight.
0: 
C:                     KEARNS
D:           We been at it all day. Put up
D:           twelve hundred bales. What do you
D:           know about that?
0: 
C:                     BILL HODGES
D:           I told Larry before. I grew up in a
D:           place just like this. My whole
D:           family are farmers.

C:                     LARRY
D:           Yeah, well I thought I told you,
D:           you should stop wasting your time.
D:           Don’t know what my mom told you,
D:           but I’m done playing college ball.
D:           You need a player up there, why
D:           don’t you talk to Kearns. He’d have
D:           been a great player, ever gotten
D:           the chance.
0: 
C:                      BILL HODGES
D:           They say the same thing about you.
E:               (that slows Larry a bit)
D:           I don’t know what happened in
D:           Bloomington, son, but Indiana
D:           State’s a small school. Only 3000
D:           kids. You’d fit in there just fine.
E:               (beat)
D:           You all three should come up. Play
D:           some ball with the team. Take a
D:           look at Terre Haute.
0: 
C:                     MARK
D:           You actually gotta team there? You
D:           ever even been to the tournament?
0: 
N: Larry and the boys laughs. Hodges takes it in stride.
0: 
C:                     HODGES
D:           Not yet, but we will. It just takes
D:           the right players.

D:           any shot and when you get in that
D:           zone -- like we’ve been playing on
D:           season -- everything else fades
D:           away. There’s no past. There’s no
D:           problems. It’s just like nothing

C:                     COOP
D:           He’s the MVP of the league and we
D:           just won back to back titles. You
D:           want Magic to slow down?
0: 
C:                     PAT RILEY
D:           There’s plenty of ways to burn out.

D:           I’m not getting in the middle of

D:           The guy is a prince. My car’s in
D:           the shop, he lent me his for a
D:           month. I’m driving it right now. I
D:           wouldn’t change him one bit.

C:                     PAT RILEY
D:           Nobody’s talking about change, I’m
D:           just saying be careful. You run an
D:           engine too hot, eventually they
D:           explode. He’s not actually Magic.

D:           can you go grab those numbers from
D:           the box? I got a girl I need to

N: Coop hangs up the phone as this time we end on:

N: Magic in his bedroom which we now see is occupied by SIX

D:           When they going to do one of me?

N: M.L.’s referring to the famous WOODEN STATUE OF LARRY on
N: exhibit outside the arena.

C:                     ML CARR
D:           Motherfucker. At least I can jump.
D:           That thing moves better than you.
D:           They need to add a few pounds, they
D:           wanna make it more accurate.

S: INT. BOSTON GARDEN - A FEW HOURS LATER
0: 
N: Larry battles MICHAEL JORDAN and the Bulls in the Garden,
N: having a pretty bad night. Jordan, younger, ascendant, a
N: different caliber of athlete, puts on a show while --
0: 
N: Larry, back breaking in pain, watches large stretches of the
N: game from the bench. Well actually --

0: 
N: From the floor by the bench where he lays on his stomach,
N: trying to soothe his bad spine. And when he gets in the game -
0: 
N: CLANK! Larry puts up a brick, cursing his broken fingers,
N: still mangled from that long ago bar brawl.
0: 
C:                     JORDAN
D:           Thought you shot better than that.
0: 
N: Jordan takes the ball down and hits a J in Larry’s face.

D:           Come on, you little bitch. Bring it
D:           back here.
0: 
N: Summoning his resolve, Bird runs down the wing and drains a
N: THREE in Jordan’s face. Jordan shakes his head.
0: 
C:                     JORDAN
D:           Man, you’re the biggest prima donna
D:           I’ve ever seen.
0: 
C:                     BIRD
D:           What the hell’s a prima donna?
0: 
N: Bird runs off past him, bumping Jordan’s shoulder, only we
N: can see Larry’s hurting. He’s still got the talent and drive,
N: but his body is failing. He can barely stand up.

N: of his back on the screen. Red looks on at his side.
0: 
C:                     DAN DYREK
D:           You’ve lost the structural
D:           stability in your spine so when you
D:           run. When you jump, it slips out of
D:           position and compresses your
D:           nerves. That’s like slamming your
D:           finger in a door, and somebody
D:           keeps shutting it harder.

C:                     LARRY
D:           Well, good thing I can’t jump.
