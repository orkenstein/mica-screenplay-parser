0: 
N: The SOUNDS of Navy Pier are overwhelming. Tourists TRAMPLE
N: down the pier. The waves of Lake Michigan CRASH below.
0: 
N: And it's here that we meet MEENA (28 and Indian). On her
N: bicycle, she peddles past the vendors and tour groups -
N: moving quickly but still taking it all in.
0: 
N: Further down the pier, we meet FREDDY (28 and white). Wearing
N: a suit and awkwardly carrying a presentation poster and a box
N: full of pamphlets, he walks out of The Grand Ballroom under a
N: banner reading NAVY PIER TECH EXPO.
0: 
N: Meena flies down the pier - looking around.
0: 
N: Freddy, meanwhile, stands alone. He looks out around the pier
N: at all the laughing, happy people. Conference attendees.
N: Families. Couples.
0: 
N: Lots of couples.
0: 
N: Zoned out, Freddy absentmindedly steps backwards when--
0: 
C:                        MEENA
D:           HEY!
0: 
N: Meena SKIDS to the left, narrowly avoiding Freddy.
0: 
N: Freddy, surprised, clumsily stumbles and FALLS to the right.
0: 
N: And his pamphlets GO EVERYWHERE.
0: 
N: Meena jumps off her bike, leaning down toward Freddy--
0: 
C:                     MEENA
E:                (slight accent)
D:           Are you OK?
0: 
N: Standing up, and wiping off a certainly bruised ass:
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           My pamphlets--
0: 
N: Meena and Freddy instantly turn and start running after the
N: pamphlets, as the wind takes them in every direction.
0: 
N: Meena grabs a handful, but Freddy almost instantly gives up.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Actually, screw it. No one wants
D:           them anyway.
0: 0:                                                                 2.
0: 
0: 
N: Now a bit more interested, Meena looks down at the glossy
N: pamphlet in her hands.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Here I can take that--
0: 
C:                     MEENA
E:                (reading)
D:           Lollipop Bop. Pop Lollipops for
D:           points--
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
E:                (dryly)
D:           And unlock secret game levels.
D:           Available on iOS and Android.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           You made this app?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I worked on it for my team.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           You don't seem very excited.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Yeah, I heard the same thing in
D:           there. But the thing is, I can-- I
D:           have made apps that'd contribute a
D:           helluva lot more to the world.
0: 
N: Freddy reaches for his pamphlet, but she pulls it back again.
0: 
C:                        MEENA
D:           Like what?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           You don't wanna hear about my app.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I'd love to hear about the app of
D:           the person I almost accidentally
D:           murdered.
0: 
N: Freddy tries to read Meena - who simply smiles back.
0: 
N: He nods his head, and straightens up.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           OK... So imagine you're a tourist--
0: 
C:                     MEENA
C:           I am a tourist.

0: 
C:                     MEENA (CONT’D)
D:           I mean, I'm new here. I'm in
D:           university.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           And what do you think of that
D:           building?
0: 
N: Freddy points up toward The Grand Ballroom, an early 20th
N: Century marvel of Chicago's past.
0: 
C:                        MEENA
D:           It's nice.
0: 
N: Freddy hands over his phone to Meena.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Now, this is just a beta version I
D:           made, but take a picture of this
D:           building with my phone.
0: 
N: Meena takes the phone and points it toward the ballroom.
0: 
N: The moment the camera CLICKS -- the screen reads: THE GRAND
N: BALLROOM - NAVY PIER. Information and stats fill the screen.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
E:                (reading)
D:           The Grand Ballroom. Part of the
D:           original 1916 construction...
D:           18,000 square feet... Wow.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           And it works for any major landmark
D:           in the city. What do you think? Be
D:           honest.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           The technology's impressive. But...
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           But why do you care about some
D:           super tourist-y, old building?
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Right... Why do I care?
0: 
N: Freddy's heard this before. He nods his head. Thinking...
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Hundreds of people were married
D:           here. The ends of wars were
D:           celebrated here. It’s... special.
0: 
N: Freddy, building up steam, points toward the Ballroom.
0: 0:                                                                 4.
0: 
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           People walk past this building
D:           everyday. Hell, you were about to.
D:           And maybe I'm a dork for this
D:           stuff, but I want people to
D:           interact with their city and feel
D:           like they're a part of its history.
0: 
N: He smiles. She smiles.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           That's slightly more interesting
D:           than Lollipop Bop, right?
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Listen, this is really cool. And I
D:           can tell you from what I know,
D:           especially with financing, it’s all
D:           about passion. This is where your
D:           passion is. Not this.
0: 
N: Meena hands back the Lollipop Bop pamphlet.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           So speak from the heart, and you'll
D:           do fine.
0: 
N: They look at one another. It's that moment where someone
N: either makes a move, or...
0: 
N: The moment passes.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           OK. Well, I gotta get going... Bye.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Yeah, see ya.
0: 
N: Meena climbs up on her bike.
0: 
N: She looks back at Freddy, and then peddles down the pier.
0: 
N: Freddy watches her go. He turns to head the other direction--
0: 
N: But then he turns back again to get her attention, except--
0: 
N: Meena is gone.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           ... Dammit.
0: 
N: As if in a daze, Freddy walks down the pier.
0: 
N: NEAR THE CRYSTAL GARDENS...
0: 0:                                                                 5.
0: 
0: 
N: Freddy walks farther down the pier, looking around for Meena.
0: 
C:                        FREDDY
D:              Dammit.
0: 
N: ON THE PIER'S EDGE...
0: 
N: Meena is nowhere in sight.
0: 
N: Resigned, Freddy leans against the pier's railing.
0: 
C:                        FREDDY
E:                   (softly)
D:              Dammit.
0: 
N: Freddy, once again alone, looks out over the lake.
0: 
N: And as he thinks to himself...
0: 
N: The sound of CRASHING WAVES starts to fade...
0: 
N: And faintly, we hear the sound of STRINGS.
0: 
N: Then HORNS.
0: 
N: Then Freddy looks up. At us.
0: 
N: And SINGS.
0: 
N: Freddy is nearly as surprised as we are as the words flow out
N: of his mouth. She was beautiful, he sings. She helped him
N: find his voice. But she got away.
0: 
N: Where's That Girl?
0: 
N: The SONG, which feels straight out of a 1950's Gene Kelly
N: picture, is about that undefinable gut feeling when you meet
N: someone you need to know. Someone special.
0: 
N: His voice is at first hesitant, but it soon grows stronger...
0: 
N: With supreme confidence, Freddy turns and faces the crowded
N: Navy Pier - intent on finding Meena.
0: 
N: Light on his feet, and with a beat in his step, he dances to
N: a song only Freddy can hear!
0: 
N: Freddy spins around a TOUR GROUP. He ducks under a selfie
N: stick yielding TOURIST DAD. Looking for Meena high and low.
0: 
N: Seeking higher ground, Freddy hops from a bench onto a
N: lamppost. Swinging from the post, he looks over the pier.
0: 
N: His eyes light up. He spots Meena!
0: 0:                                                                 6.
0: 
0: 
N: But-- She's quickly peddling away from the pier and down
N: toward Lakefront Trail. Every moment she's farther and
N: farther away.
0: 
N: And Freddy is heartbroken.
0: 
N: He falls back onto a nearby bench. And as his motions slow,
N: so does the MUSIC. Freddy will never catch up with her now.
0: 
N: Then Freddy's eyes drift to a nearby vendor. And he instantly
N: perks up...
0: 
N: ROLLER SKATE RENTAL
0: 
N: Freddy looks from the vendor, to Lakefront Trail, to us...
0: 
T:                                                  CUT TO:
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. LAKEFRONT TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: With purpose, and with the orchestra's STRINGS behind him,
N: Freddy zooms down Lakefront Trail - perhaps even lighter and
N: more nimble on skates than he was in his shoes.
0: 
N: He moves fast, with the agility of a dancer - skating left,
N: right, and backwards - avoiding RUNNERS, MOTHERS with
N: strollers, and texting TEENS.
0: 
N: Then Freddy spots her!
0: 
N: Meena is just off the trail in a small park area, in front of
N: Buckingham Fountain.
0: 
N: So Freddy spins around, jumps over a small barrier, and
N: skates into the park. He finally SKIDS up next to Meena.
0: 
N: Meena turns and faces Freddy.
0: 
N: Eyebrow raised, she looks him up and down (pausing on his
N: inexplicable skates.) She can't help but smile.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Hi. I'm the guy from before who's
D:           way too into old buildings. But I
D:           figure since you're new to town, I
D:           could show you around. Test out my
D:           app.
E:                (beat)
D:           Maybe go to a movie too?
0: 
N: Freddy pulls his phone out of his suit pocket.
0: 0:                                                                 7.
0: 
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           So I'd love to have your number. If
D:           not, it's fine. I'll just skate
D:           away forever, I promise.
0: 
N: Meena looks at the phone. And then to Freddy.
0: 
N: Considering...
0: 
N: But she nods, and takes the phone, plugging in her number.
0: 
N: And as she hands it back to a very relieved Freddy:
0: 
C:                        MEENA
D:           I'm Meena.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I'm Freddy.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Nice to meet you.
0: 
N: She hops back on her bike. Then pauses.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Are you going to follow me again?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           No. I'm good. Very good.
0: 
N: She takes one final look at Freddy - confused and intrigued -
N: and peddles down the trail.
0: 
N: Freddy watches her go.
0: 
N: Then at the very moment Meena turns a curve, disappearing out
N: of sight--
0: 
N: THE MUSIC BLASTS! And Freddy can't contain himself.
0: 
N: He skates around the fountain - feeling lighter than air.
0: 
N: Freddy celebrates the moment, and begins to tap dance (in
N: skates, no less!)
0: 
N: The MUSIC builds!
0: 
N: The FOUNTAINS turn on!
0: 
N: And Freddy spins around for the big celebratory finish!
0: 0:                                                                 8.

S: INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
0: 
N: Unlike the bright fantasy of before, we now re-enter the real
N: world, as Meena pushes open her apartment door, with a bag of
N: groceries in her arms.
0: 
N: Her apartment is standard university student drab. Off-white,
N: mostly blank walls.
0: 
N: Her phone rings, and she answers:
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Hi Mummy, Papa. Kaise ho?... Kya
D:           kar rahe ho?...
0: 
N: As she speaks with her parents, she goes in and out of Hindi.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Today?... Went to Navy Pier. Just
D:           looked around...
E:                (beat)
D:           Just by myself. But it was special.
0: 
N: Meena lingers on that last thought, looking off.
0: 
N: And in that moment, she hears the faintest of STRINGS...
0: 
N: She snaps herself out of it.
0: 
C:                      MEENA
D:           And then I rode my bike home. And
D:           that's it.
0: 
N: Meena shakes her head as the conversation moves on. She
N: listens as her mother continues speaking on the other line.
0: 
N: She looks to her refrigerator. Hung by a magnet is a single
N: photo. Of Meena and her parents. She looks at it...
0: 
C:                     MEENA (V.O.) (PRE-LAP)
D:           Are you close to your parents?
0: 
0: 
S: INT. 'L' TRAIN - EVENING
0: 
N: A sparsely filled train car rides through the city at dusk.
0: 
N: Sitting side by side, Freddy and Meena continue their
N: conversation:
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           They live like 10 minutes up the
D:           road. So yeah.

0: 
C:                     FREDDY (CONT’D)
D:           But, seriously, we're super close.
D:           Talk to them about everything
D:           happening in my life.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Did you tell them about tonight?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I would consider this something
D:           happening in my life. Right?
0: 
N: Meena nods uncomfortably.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           And are you close with your folks?
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I talk to them everyday. But it's
D:           hard. They're back in New Delhi.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           What's it like there?
0: 
N: Meena lights up.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Delhi's my favorite place in the
D:           world. It's vibrant. And crazy. And
D:           full of life and good food. And
D:           history. Like India Gate, which is
D:           super tourist-y... but you'd like
D:           it.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Yeah. Well, I've never even left
D:           the country.
0: 
C:                      MEENA
D:           Why not?
0: 
N: Freddy PAUSES - as if he'd never considered it.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I don't know. I guess I just...
D:           never took that leap.
0: 
N: He smiles at Meena. And she smiles back.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Well... I'm gonna move back after I
D:           graduate. I wanna modernize my
D:           dad's export business. Actually, I
D:           wanna run it. Now, normally it
D:           would go to the son.

D:           But my brother doesn't want it. And
D:           I-- really, really do.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Your brother, he's back in India?
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Yeah. In fact, he just got engaged.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Oh congrats. You like her?
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I haven't met her yet. Actually, he
D:           only just met her a few weeks ago.
0: 
N: Freddy readjusts in his seat, weighing his next question.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           So... was it... you know... one of
D:           those...?
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Arranged marriage?
0: 
N: Meena takes a deep breath, patiently answering a common (and
N: annoying) question.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           No. At least not what you're
D:           thinking. It's definitely less
D:           weird than it sounds. I mean, it's
D:           not like they only get to meet once
D:           before their wedding.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Yeah, cause that'd be crazy--
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           That's how my parents were married.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Cool.
E:                (beat)
D:           So how does it work then?
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           He'd go on dates with the girls my
D:           parents found. Usually recommended
D:           through friends. Plus, my parents
D:           passed around his biodata.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           His... what?

0: 
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Biodata. It's like a resume for
D:           parents to set up their kids. Like,
D:           my brother's says he's a writer in
D:           Mumbai. Or mine says I'm studying
D:           for my MBA.
0: 
N: Freddy PAUSES for a moment, before turning to Meena.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           You have a biodata?
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I didn't make it. My parents did.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           So they're out there trying to set
D:           you up, while you're dating?
0: 
N: But Freddy puts it together almost immediately.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Except, they don't know you date.
0: 
N: Meena, growing serious, gathers her thoughts.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           They're not ultra-traditional. They
D:           just don't understand the concept
D:           of dating. They don't get it.
0: 
N: As she speaks, Meena becomes more animated. More frustrated.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           And they'll bring up the different
D:           cultures and values and how people
D:           will talk. Like this family friend,
D:           Nidhi Patni, she went against her
D:           family's wishes, married a white
D:           guy, got divorced, and I've never
D:           heard the end of it!
0: 
N: Meena catches herself. She takes a deep breath and continues.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           What I'm saying is, if I really
D:           liked someone, and if we got
D:           serious, it still would never, ever
D:           work for my parents.
0: 
N: She nods to herself as if to justify her own logic.

0: 
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           This is awkward. And mortifying.
D:           I'm so sorry. I'm just going to get
D:           off at the next stop.
0: 
N: As the train slowly BRAKES, approaching the next station,
N: Meena stands up and walks toward the door.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           What if they don't need to know.
0: 
N: The train door in front of Meena OPENS... but she doesn't
N: leave.
0: 
N: Freddy stands, and walks toward her.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           We don't even know what this is
D:           yet. I know I like you. I know I'd
D:           like a second date.
0: 
N: Meena turns to face him... as the door behind her CLOSES.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           It may not be easy. But what you
D:           said about speaking from the
D:           heart... well I want to see where
D:           this goes. Cause I've got a good
D:           feeling about it.
0: 
N: And then, as if on cue... MUSIC builds behind Freddy.
0: 
N: And Freddy, with the utmost confidence, SINGS to Meena.
0: 
N: He tells her that when he saw her riding away, all he wanted
N: was to make her stay...
0: 
N: And going after her, he had one thought.
0: 
N: Let's Give It A Shot
0: 
N: The train lights dim, except for a light directly above
N: Freddy and Meena - spotlighting the pair as if they're the
N: only two people in the world.
0: 
N: Meena briefly notices the world changing around her, but
N: finds it hard to keep her eyes off Freddy.
0: 
N: And then... Meena SINGS.
0: 
N: She sings softly at first, but as she literally finds her
N: voice, Meena grows louder.
0: 0:                                                                 13.
0: 
0: 
N: Her lyrics unveil her own take on the events at the pier. She
N: says she doesn't even know him. He's just some cute guy who
N: skated into her life. Should they give it a shot?
0: 
N: And as they begin to sing back and forth, their duet extends
N: to their feet. They slowly move in step with one another.
0: 
N: Before they know it, Freddy and Meena are dancing, matching
N: each other beat for beat.
0: 
N: Their pace quickens. He swings around the train's metal pole.
N: She does the same.
0: 
N: Then they hop up on the train's seats. Their fellow RIDERS
N: don't bother to look up from their books and phones - as
N: Freddy and Meena jump, tap, and dance through the train car.
0: 
N: Meena spins and ends up in Freddy's embrace-- just as the
N: doors to the train once again open at a new station.
0: 
N: She looks up at him, and--
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. LOGAN SQUARE - NIGHT
0: 
N: Under the bright bulbs of Logan Theater, Meena and Freddy
N: waltz down the empty sidewalks.
0: 
N: Fast paced and energetic, Freddy's hand is on Meena's lower
N: back. Her hand is on his shoulder. He moves her around the
N: square as if she is weightless.
0: 
N: They slow to a stop. Wrapped up in each other's arms.
0: 
N: Looking directly into each other's eyes.
0: 
N: Then they kiss.
0: 
N: They'll give it a shot.

S: INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT - DAY
0: 
N: The SOUND of a printer hard at work.
0: 
N: Scissors SNIP at a print-out.
0: 
N: On the refrigerator - next to the photo of her parents -
N: Meena hangs up a new glossy photo. It's a selfie of Meena and
N: Freddy from their first date in Logan Square.
0: 
N: Still high from it, she smiles while looking at the photo.
0: 
N: Her phone BUZZES. Meena's eyes light up.

0: 
S: EXT. NAVY PIER - DAY
0: 
N: Back where it all began, Meena and Freddy ride the Centennial
N: Ferris Wheel at Navy Pier. We can practically hear him
N: describing how the Ferris Wheel was invented in Chicago by
N: George Washington Ferris - and she's not even that annoyed!
0: 
0: 
S: INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT - DAY
0: 
N: On Meena's refrigerator now hangs a photo of them on the
N: Ferris Wheel.

N: together. They bump into each other, finding their rhythm.

S: INT. KINGSTON MINES - NIGHT

0: 
N: Sitting on a beach towel, they look out over the lake to the

S: INT. FREDDY'S PARENTS' HOME - EVENING
0: 
N: A Christmas tree in the corner. A fireplace warms the room.
N: Snow falls outside the windows.
0: 
N: Freddy and Meena sit on the floor near the tree, facing
N: FREDDY'S FATHER and MOTHER. His GRANDPARENTS rest on a nearby
N: couch.
0: 
N: A sincere, joyful smile crosses Meena's face as she watches
N: Freddy LAUGH heartily at a joke his father made -- only
N: interrupted by the surprise of his mother placing a wrapped
N: Christmas present on her lap.

N: Surrounded by her cap and gown-clad classmates, Freddy poses
N: for a selfie with Meena as she kisses him on the cheek.
0: 
N: But Meena, distracted, reaches into her gown and pulls out
N: her BUZZING phone. She motions to Freddy to hang on a second.
0: 
N: Call from "Mummy and Papa".
0: 
N: Freddy knows the drill. He nods and takes a step back. Hands
N: in his pockets, Freddy looks on as Meena answers the phone
N: with a big, excited smile on her face.

N: The refrigerator is now completely covered with photos.
0: 
N: Standing in the kitchen, Meena surveys the snapshots of her
N: new life over the past year.
0: 
N: The photo of Meena and Freddy at graduation. Photos of them
N: playing skeeball at a barcade. With Freddy's family. In the
N: park as Spring has turned once again to Summer.
0:

D:           Listen. We've all had our secret

D:           invite your parents to come visit.
0: 
N: Meena is keeping her cool. Trying to be patient on an issue
N: that they've clearly discussed many times before.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           It's not that easy. Once we involve
D:           them, please believe me, things
D:           would get hard. Complicated.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           See, I disagree. Cause if
D:           something's meant to be, then it
D:           will just... be.
0: 
N: Freddy smiles. So incredibly sure of himself.
0: 
N: Meena looks Freddy up and down before taking his arm and
N: snuggling in closer.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Things will just fall into place
D:           for us. I really believe that.

D:           You'll be here in the Fall. So
D:           they'll be here in the Fall. It'll
D:           be as easy as that.
0: 
N: Her phone BUZZES. She picks it up.
0: 
N: An e-mail. ON SCREEN we catch the words: "Meena..."
N: "Interview..." "We regret..."

N: Meena rides in the back of a Lyft. She's on her phone again.
0: 
N: ON SCREEN: "We're sorry to inform you that--"

C:                        FREDDY (O.S.)
D:           What's up?
0: 
N: Meena looks up toward Freddy, sitting beside her.
0: 
N: She almost says something, but decides against it.

D:           Nothing.
0:

C:                     MEENA
D:           Then we'll rewind.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Then I might as well just pause it.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Never pause it. Just play!

C:                     MEENA
D:           I'm kidding! Just play it!

S: EXT. MEENA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
0: 
N: Moving slowly up a sidewalk, Meena is in a daze.
0: 
N: She's two steps behind Freddy, who is bounding up the stairs
N: to her apartment complex.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Have you packed yet? Cause you
D:           don't wanna wait too long.
0: 
N: She follows him inside--

0: 
S: INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: Meena briefly pauses at the front door.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I need to tell you something...
0: 
N: But Freddy's out of earshot, so she quickens her pace and
N: catches up with him in the hallway as he keeps walking ahead.
0: 
C:                      FREDDY
D:           So the flight's in four days. And
D:           your brother's wedding is in three
D:           weeks. And then you're back here by
D:           the 26th--

D:           Freddy--
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Which, I know, makes you nervous.
D:           But you'll have ten days to find a
D:           job before the visa expires--

0: 
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Then we're all set.
0: 
N: Freddy finishes speaking as he arrives at her doorstep.
0: 
N: At her door, Meena turns the key in the lock, and partially
N: opens the door.
0: 
N: She then pauses, keeping the door ajar.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I really, really need to tell you
D:           something...
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           What is it? What's going on?
0: 
N: Now worried, Freddy moves past Meena and opening the door to
N: her apartment.
0: 
N: He enters...
0: 
0: 
S: INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: And Freddy finds her apartment completely empty.
0: 
N: The walls are bare. The couch is gone. All that remains are
N: some boxes in the corner.
0: 
N: Freddy turns to face Meena, still standing in the doorway.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I wanted to say something earlier.
D:           I'm sorry I didn't.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           What's going on?
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           When I go to India next week, I'm
D:           not coming back.
0: 
N: This hits Freddy like a gut punch. He looks for somewhere to
N: sit, but there's nothing.
0: 
N: Meena takes a step in from the doorway.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           My visa will expire. So I'm going
D:           home to help run my dad's company.
D:           That's what I've been working
D:           toward. Planning for. And this...

0: 
N: Freddy nods his head.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           You're giving up.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I'm being realistic.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Real? What we have is real. But for
D:           the past year you've kept a
D:           distance. You've never gone all in!
D:           Cause you're absolutely terrified
D:           of commitment.
0: 
N: Meena moves toward Freddy. Her sadness seeping into anger.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I'm only terrified because I'm not
D:           living in a fantasy. You haven't
D:           been listening and have no idea how
D:           scary my situation actually is!
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           What-- that you'll disappoint your
D:           parents? That your dad won't let
D:           you take over the family business?
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           So I'm supposed to give up on my
D:           dreams?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           All I know is that I love you and
D:           it shouldn't matter the obstacle--
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           They're not obstacles; they're my
D:           family! And if anyone was an
D:           obstacle to my plans it was you--
0: 
N: Their argument has brought them face to face.
0: 
N: And their anger quickly retreats back to embarrassment.
0: 
C:                        MEENA
D:           I'm sorry.
0: 0:                                                                 24.
0: 
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I'm sorry, too. I know you have
D:           plans. Amazing plans. I just wanted
D:           to be a part of them.
0: 
N: Freddy, embarrassed, looks down at the floor.
0: 
C:                      MEENA
E:                 (taking a deep breath)
D:           Let's be logical. If we stay
D:           together, my parents will find out.
D:           Best case scenario, they'll expect
D:           us to get married. Are we ready for
D:           that?
E:                 (beat)
D:           Because if you met my parents, I
D:           don't know how they'd react. If you
D:           met my grandparents-- my God, you
D:           couldn't even speak to them because
D:           you don't speak Hindi--

E:                (head still down)
D:           Meena, I...
0: 
N: Meena takes Freddy's head in her hand, forcing him to look at
N: her and confront the issue before them.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I know you think it should be easy.
D:           But even you have to admit that
D:           this is too hard.
0: 
N: Freddy shuts his eyes, hoping this moment can just end.
0: 
N: She's heartbroken. His world is destroyed.
0: 
N: Meena takes Freddy's hands in hers. She searches for the
N: words so Freddy will understand.
0: 
N: So she sings.
0: 
N: She wishes things would change. But they won't. She wants to
N: be with him. But she doesn't know how. She doesn't want to
N: hurt like this. But she does.
0: 
N: And she's afraid they'll hurt each other more if they don't
N: deal with this now.
0: 
N: Therefore, she must stick to her plans. Therefore, she sings:
0: 
N: I Have To Go
0: 0:                                                                 25.

S: INT. MEENA'S APARTMENT - DAY
0: 
N: Alone in her kitchen, Meena continues SINGING.

S: EXT. STREETS OF CHICAGO - NIGHT
0: 
N: Walking arm in arm, her SONG continues as Freddy and Meena

0: 
T:                                                     CUT TO:

0: 
S: INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
0: 
N: The SOUNDS of gate change announcements, dragged suitcases,
N: and crying babies. O'Hare International Airport.
0: 
N: This is where they'll say goodbye.
0: 
N: From a distance, we watch as Meena faces Freddy at the
N: security line.
0: 
N: We cannot hear the words they exchange, but we know it's only
N: pleasantries hiding tremendous hurt.
0: 
N: They embrace. And then Meena turns to leave, wiping a tear
N: from her face.
0: 
N: Freddy remains a moment, before turning and leaving alone,
N: with his head hung low.
0: 
0: 
S: INT. AIRPORT - MOVING SIDEWALK PASSAGEWAY - LATER
0: 
N: In an under lit and empty passageway connecting terminals,
N: Meena stands on a moving walkway. She cries softly, as it
N: carries her toward her awaiting plane.
0: 
N: She shuts her eyes tight, fighting back tears.
0: 
N: Then, Meena opens her eyes. She turns around. Facing toward
N: where she came from. Unable to contain the emotions bubbling
N: up within her...
0: 0:                                                                 26.
0: 
0: 
N: She SINGS.
0: 
N: She sings that she must be logical. She has to go.
0: 
N: He should have understood. She has to go.
0: 
N: Meena walks toward us. And against the walkway. Going
N: nowhere.
0: 
N: She sings about how she'll miss him more than she's ever
N: missed someone before. And yet, she has to go.
0: 
N: So Meena stops singing. Wipes her face. Turns back around.
N: And let's the walkway take her to her gate.
0: 
N: Standing still, but every moment getting farther and farther
N: away from Freddy...
0: 
T:                                                 FADE OUT.

0: 
N: Home from the airport, Freddy enters his apartment.
0: 
N: He shuffles to the living room, and collapses onto the couch.
0: 
N: Hanging above him, black and white movie posters adorn the
N: wall. Movies with happier endings than his own experience.

S: INT. FREDDY'S PARENTS' HOME - DAY
0: 
N: Freddy sits with his mother and father in the living room,

C:                        FREDDY'S MOTHER
D:              We loved her, but she never even
D:              told her parents about you. How
D:              serious could she have been?
0: 
N: Freddy, distracted, barely acknowledges her statement.
0: 0:                                                                 27.

D:           You need to be realistic, son. It

0: 
N: Freddy looks up, and nods his head.

0: 
S: EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - DAY
0: 
N: Freddy walks the streets of Chicago, lost in thought--
0: 
N: He looks up: LOGAN THEATER. The site of their first date.
0: 
N: He gazes around Logan Square.
0: 
N: And mixed with the SOUNDS of cars, trains, and crowds...
0: 
N: The SOUND of STRINGS.
0: 
N: Freddy takes a deep breath, and--
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
0: 
N: Freddy - wearing a small backpack - bursts out of his
N: apartment complex and starts strutting down the sidewalk.
0: 
N: The MUSIC builds behind him. And while the busy world around
N: him may not see or hear it, he SINGS and DANCES with more
N: life and focus than we've ever seen.
0: 
N: He sings that he can't give up so easily. Nothing - nothing!
N: - beats a grand gesture. So...
0: 
N: I Have To Go!
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. 'L' TRAIN - DAY
0: 
N: On the train platform, as a train blows past, he hops up on a

N: credits. And he can have his happy ending!
0: 
N: He has to go!

S: INT. AIRPORT - DAY

C:                     FREDDY
D:           One ticket to India.
0: 
N: He's beaming.

D:           Do you have a ticket?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           No. I, uh, need one. I guess.
0: 
C:                     TICKET AGENT
D:           And you want to buy it here? At the
D:           counter? And not, like, online?
E:                (beat)
D:           I mean you can technically do it.
D:           But it'll cost a lot. Like a ton.
E:                (beat)
D:           Why do you need a ticket so bad?

C:                     TICKET AGENT
D:           This gonna be cash or credit?

0: 
S: INT. AIRPORT - MOVING SIDEWALK PASSAGEWAY - DAY
0: 
N: OK, so now the MUSIC swells!
0: 
N: Freddy marches down the same depressing moving sidewalk that
N: took Meena away from him. Only this time, lights of every
N: color illuminate the passageway.
0: 
N: Freddy sings: he can't not be with her. It's that simple.
0: 
N: He'll do anything - anything! - to be by her side.
0: 
N: So... he has to go!
0: 
N: He dances, spinning around and jumping back and forth on the
N: moving sidewalk. The MUSIC builds and builds, as the colors
N: grow brighter and brighter...

0: 
S: INT. AIRPORT - GATE - DAY

N: Finally, he reaches his gate.
0: 
N: His foot nervously taps. He takes a deep breath. And he sings
N: below his breath that he has to go.

S: EXT. AIRPORT - DAY
0: 
N: And as the orchestra plays, hitting its crescendo...
0: 
N: Freddy takes off into the air...
0: 
T:                                                FADE OUT:

0: 
S: EXT. MARKET - DAY
0: 
N: Freddy - wearing his backpack and looking the part of the
N: American tourist - smiles.
0: 
N: He looks left, and takes a step forward into a street--
0: 
N: WHISH!
0: 
N: A car ZIPS by Freddy, nearly running him over. He hops
N: backward onto the sidewalk.
0: 
N: Rattled, Freddy's eyes dart around - perhaps now only fully
N: taking in his surrounding.
0: 
N: MARKET VENDORS display their saris. Cows absentmindedly
N: wander through the streets. A MAN sells pani puri to hungry
N: customers from his cart.
0: 
N: Taxis and auto-ricksaws fill Freddy's view, and their non-
N: stop car-horns fill his ears.
0: 
N: We PULL OUT and reveal a packed city street in the heart of
N: New Delhi. THOUSANDS fill the marekt, and Freddy is only a
N: very, very small part of what is happening around him.
0: 
N: And as the DRUMS continue to build...
0: 
N: MUSIC EXPLODES - backed by a full orchestra - and the entire
N: crowd bursts into song!
0: 
N: Freddy has landed in a Bollywood musical!
0: 
N: [NOTE: The Indian dialogue and lyrics are a natural mix of
N: Hindi and English - much like you'd actually hear in New
N: Delhi's Connaught Place or Select City Mall.]

0: 
0: 
N: Seemingly every resident of Delhi starts SINGING. And
N: DANCING. All while going about their lives. Whether a TAXI
N: DRIVER or a ROADSIDE BARBER or a group of SCHOOL CHILDREN.
0: 
N: Hundreds of conversations are SUNG as we whip around the
N: market. The lyrics are a small snippet of life in New Delhi.
0: 
N: "Cut me a deal, that's nearly half a lakh." "I need a salwar
N: kameez for the Mehndi." "Want some chicken tikka pizza from
N: Nirula's?" "Virat Kohli's the greatest batsman of all time."
0: 
N: Even with subtitles, Freddy would be completely lost.
0: 
N: And as they hit the chorus, they announce WELCOME TO DELHI!
0: 
N: It's the biggest apple. A city that truly never sleeps.
0: 
N: A magic city and an eternal city.
0: 
N: A city of love. A city of lights. A city of music and car
N: horns blasting through the night.
0: 
N: Freddy tries his best to sing along - but he's lost, not
N: knowing the words. And he's out of step with the dance,
N: discovering that you can't tap dance across a street when
N: seven lanes of traffic whiz by on a three lane road.
0: 
N: With now hundreds dancing in unison, completely blocking
N: Freddy out, the ensemble comes together for the big finish.
0: 
N: Welcome to Delhi!
0: 
N: And as quickly as it began--
0: 
N: The song ends.
0: 
N: The ensemble dissipates to go back about their lives.
0: 
N: Freddy stands alone. He looks around, now more confused than
N: he was before.
0: 
N: A look of horror then creeps across his face.
0: 
N: Patting his back pocket, he discovers: his wallet is gone.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Oh no no no no no.
0: 
N: He looks all around, as CROWDS casually breeze past him in
N: every direction. He's lost. Confused. And screwed.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           What am I doing here?

S: EXT. MEENA'S HOUSE - DAY
0: 
N: A gate opens... revealing Meena.
0: 
N: The past few weeks have worn on her. She looks tired. As if
N: exhausted from weeks of crying.
0: 
N: She takes a deep breath, and allows a smile to fight its way
N: to the surface.
0: 
N: We follow as Meena enters a driveway, passing by a DRIVER who
N: is washing the family car.
0: 
C:                       MEENA
D:           Namaste.
0: 
N: He smiles and puts his hands together in return.
0: 
N: Past him, Meena reaches a small barking Indian Spitz dog,
N: running around in circles and jumping to catch her attention.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Hi Sultan baby!
0: 
N: She pets her dog, and turns toward her home.
0: 
N: It's a large house, surrounded by greenery on all sides. But
N: just as we get a good look at it, we follow Meena inside...

0: 
S: INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: The house is mostly marble, with Indian art on the walls.

N: Meena heads toward the stairs, but takes an impulsive turn
N: toward the kitchen...
0: 
0: 
S: INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: We follow as Meena enters the large kitchen. Off to the side,
N: a COOK chops onions. He doesn't notice as Meena walks to the
N: stove.

C:                       MEENA
D:           Kaise ho?
0: 
N: She takes a spoon and tries the dish being prepared. From her
N: face we know it's delicious.

D:           Not ready. Not ready.

N: With a smile, she turns and heads out of the kitchen...

0: 
S: INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: Back in the entryway, Meena walks up the stairs.
0: 
N: Past a sweeping MAID, with whom she exchanges a smile.
0: 
N: Finally, she arrives upstairs to find her parents...

0: 
N: SANDEEP sits at his desk, squinting as he types on his very
N: small phone screen. While he may wear business suits in
N: meetings, at home he relaxes in kurta pajamas.
0: 
N: SHREE sits in a chair nearby, playing around on an iPad.
N: Shree is never not in a traditional salwar kameez or sari.
0:

N: Sandeep and Shree both look up toward their daughter.

C:                     SANDEEP
D:           He was behind schedule.

C:                     MEENA
D:           Well, now we're doubly behind

E:                (to Shree)
D:           Mummy, tell Papa we need a planner
D:           for your son's wedding.

N: Shree has returned her focus completely to her iPad.
0: 
C:                     SHREE
D:           Whatever your Papa says.
0: 
N: Meena rolls her eyes, turning back to Sandeep.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           And then, without asking me, you
D:           hired this Narim Patel fellow?
0: 0:                                                   33.

D:           Narim Patel? Yes beta. I did hire
D:           him. But I may have fired him also.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           You fired two wedding planners?
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           They were overcharging! I can cut
D:           better deals than both of them.
D:           These wedding planners are all
D:           about sending business to their
D:           friends. This way, I can instead
D:           send business to my friends.

0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           We don't need a wedding planner.

D:           No. I said I'd be less intense. I'm

D:           We use e-mail. Regardless, kids

N: CROWDS OF DOZENS stand in line at the train terminal to

0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Also, I have no money. My wallet

D:           I also have nine American dollars.

N: Freddy once again finds himself in a awful, shitty situation.
0: 
N: He's then surprised when DEV slaps his hand on Freddy's

0: 
C:                     DEV
D:           I'm sorry. He's confused. I needed

D:           wherever he was--
E:                (beat)
D:           But I'm here. Work with my father's

N: A scene from the film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.

C:                     DEV
D:           Impossible. All Indians love white

D:           But I was in love with someone

N: And so, they take another shot.

N: AND IN YET ANOTHER MOMENT, Dev and Freddy pass a bottle of
N: whiskey back and forth. And soon their perfect dance steps

D:           Listen you fool! If you want to

D:           I'm sorry. Your driver let me in.

C:                     SANDEEP (O.S.)
D:           Wait! Wait!
0: 
N: Sandeep runs back into the hallway, skidding in between Meena
N: and Kabir.
0: 
N: Out of breath, he shakes Kabir's hand.
0: 
C:                      SANDEEP
D:           Kabir, my boy! Do you have the
D:           paperwork?
0: 
N: Kabir hands over a small envelope, which Sandeep barely
N: acknowledges before turning to Meena.
0: 
N: Feigning surprise at her presense, he turns back to Kabir.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           Oh, I forgot to introduce you. This
D:           is my daughter Meena. She recently
D:           got her MBA. In America!
E:                (to Meena)
D:           And this is Kabir.
0: 
N: Meena blankly looks at her father, before throwing on a fake

D:           We're closing some deals, so I
D:           wanted Kabir to come over and
D:           officially introduce himself to me.
D:           And us.
0: 
N: Sandeep's enthusiasm for this introduction is far beyond both
N: Meena, who stares straight at her father, and Kabir, who
N: mostly looks down at his feet.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           I know there could be some
D:           potential, uh, arrangements. Not
D:           arrangements, but we want to set
D:           up-- I mean, we're setting up, or
D:           rather putting together a potential
D:           partnership. Yes! Partnership.
0: 
N: Sandeep beams proudly.
0: 
N: Meena is mortified.

0: 
C:                     DEV
D:           Here's your ticket. And when you
D:           arrive, this should cover the cost
D:           of your taxi. Unless...
E:                (beat)
D:           Unless you're American. So...
E:                (hands him more cash)

0: 
C:                     DEV
D:           It's not that simple. Because...
D:           they won't let me be with... him.
0: 
N: The final word hangs in the air.
0: 
C:                     DEV

D:           You don't need to be with her. You

S: EXT. MEENA'S HOUSE - DAY
0: 
N: Meena sits on a small bench in her front lawn.
0: 
N: Her dog Sultan silently sits beside her as she pets him.
0: 
N: Behind her, Kabir exits the house.
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           Correct me if I'm wrong, but I
D:           think your father may have called
D:           me over for more than business.
0: 
N: Meena turns around and looks at Kabir curiously.
0: 
N: Kabir walks up and stands near her.
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           I had no idea. You must believe me.

N: She nods, giving a slight laugh at how silly it all is.
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           All the same, it was nice to meet
D:           you. So, if I'm tricked into seeing
D:           you a second time, that would be
D:           fine with me.
0: 
N: Kabir smiles at his own (objectively) great line.
0: 
N: He then leans down to pet Sultan, who--
0: 
N: GROWLS and BARKS at Kabir, shooting him backwards.
0: 
N: Kabir awkwardly LAUGHS, nods to Meena, and stumbles away.
0: 
N: She watches him go, hiding her own laughter while petting a
N: now extremely calm Sultan.
0: 
N: Meena looks up as Shree sits down next to her.
0: 
N: Mother and daughter watch as Kabir exits out the front gate.

D:           Were you in on this?
0: 
C:                     SHREE
D:           This was all Papa. Besides, if I'd
D:           have been in on it, it'd have been
D:           so subtle, you'd never have known.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I give Papa permission to set me
D:           up, and he waits 20 hours. And then
D:           uses it as an opportunity to seal
D:           some big business deal!
0: 
C:                     SHREE
D:           That's not why he did it.
E:                (beat)
D:           That's not the only reason why he
D:           did it.

D:           I'm just not ready.

C:                     SHREE
D:           So, what did you think of him? Nice
D:           boy. Family oriented. What's wrong
D:           with him?
0: 
N: Meena searches for the words.
0: 
C:                     MEENA

S: INT. GARDEN - DAY
0: 
N: Later, Meena wanders through her parent's garden - alone.
0: 
N: Out of sight of anyone else, she pulls out her phone from her
N: pocket. With a few clicks:
0: 
N: A PICTURE OF FREDDY AND MEENA
0: 
N: She stares at it. Smiling. And then--
0: 
N: Like being hit by a flood of emotions, Meena breaks down.
0: 
N: The phone drops to the ground, and her hands cover her face,
N: as she bursts into tears.
0: 
N: She slowly lowers herself to the ground, perhaps finally
N: allowing herself to feel the pain of being without him.
0: 
N: She wipes the tears from her face. Catches her breath.
0: 
N: Meena looks directly into the camera.
0: 
N: And with a soft, sweet voice - she SINGS.
0: 
N: The song is sung in Hindi - the subtitles revealing poetic
N: language as if from another time.
0: 
N: She sings about the deep pain in her heart. An incompleteness
N: to her every moment, and a fear that this missing piece will
N: haunt her for a lifetime.
0: 
N: She feels torn - as if her heart lives in two separate lands.
0: 
N: She never thought she could feel the emotions she is feeling.
N: She never thought she would sing the words she is singing.
0: 
N: And yet there's no one to speak to about this pain. No one
N: will understand. So she sings for herself. She sings for him.
0: 0:                                                                 53.

S: INT. CAR - DAY
0: 
N: Meena sits in the backseat of her car, driven through the
N: city of New Delhi. Reflections of life hit the window, but
N: Meena's still lost deep in thought.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
0: 
N: The SONG continues over images of Meena sleepwalking her way
N: through the day.
0: 
N: Meena walks alone, past STALLS and MARKETS. She makes eye
N: contact with no one. She pays no attention to anyone or
N: anything.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. GARDEN - DAY
0: 
N: Returning to the garden, she paces back and forth.
0: 
N: Finally, Meena reaches down and picks up her phone.

S: INT. OFFICE - DAY
0: 
N: Meena and Sandeep, dressed in business attire, both shake the
N: hand of a BUSINESSMAN - as they finish a meeting together.
0: 
N: As he turns to leave, Sandeep looks toward Meena proudly.
0: 
N: Meena forces a smile.

0: 
S: EXT. GARDEN - DUSK
0: 
N: Day has turned to night.
0: 
N: Meena sits on a bench in the garden.
0: 
N: She types on her phone.
0: 
N: We only catch glimpses: FREDDY... MISS YOU... LOVE YOU...
0: 
N: Meena turns one final time toward us.
0: 
N: She SINGS: This pain I feel. I've created for myself. I could
N: end it at any moment. But I made my decision. To prevent the
N: pain for others.
0: 
N: She ASKS: Am I wrong? Why does this feel so wrong? Why does
N: this hurt so bad?
0: 
N: And with that, her finger touches the delete button.

N: Freddy JOLTS awake.
0: 
N: Wiping the drool from his mouth, he notices he's in the back
N: of a taxi.
0: 
N: The TAXI DRIVER faces him.
0:

S: INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT
0: 
N: Meena paces inside her home, going over some documents from
N: one of her many binders.
0: 
N: She hears a NOISE from outside.
0: 
N: Meena turns, looking out a window. The Guard has opened the
N: gate. A man is entering.
0: 
N: That man is FREDDY.
0: 
N: Shock. Excitement. Giddiness.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. MEENA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
0: 
N: Freddy, still in a daze, looks around as he walks up the
N: driveway.
0: 
N: His eyes turn toward the open front door. He spots MEENA.
0: 
N: She slowly walks toward him.

0: 
N: Soon, she can't control herself, and starts to jog.
0: 
N: And when they meet, they pause. Three feet apart. A smile on
N: each of their faces.

C:                        FREDDY
D:           Meena. I--

E:                (softly)
D:           Freddy...
0: 
N: Meena's smile has disappeared. Reality has set in.
0: 
N: Sandeep, with Sultan right on his heels, walks up to Freddy.
0: 
N: Sultan instantly begins sniffing and licking at Freddy.

C:                     SANDEEP
D:           Fantastic guard dog.

S: INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
0: 
N: The middle of the night. The house is quiet.
0: 
N: A bedroom door opens. Freddy eagerly pops his head out.
0: 
N: The opposite door opens. Meena stands in the doorway.

C:                     FREDDY
D:           Hi.

N: Meena puts her hands on her hips in disbelief.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Hi? Hi?! What are you doing here?!
0: 
N: Meena catches herself raising her voice, and in a panic she
N: ducks back into her bedroom.
0: 
N: A freaked out Freddy soon follows suit, closing his door.
0: 
N: Down the hallway, a door OPENS and Sandeep pops his head out.
N: Groggy and half-asleep, he looks around before closing his
N: door again.
0: 
N: The hallway is empty and quiet, until...
0: 0:                                                                 57.
0: 
0: 
N: Meena's door opens. As does Freddy's.
0: 
N: She shakes her head, and can't help but smile. He continues
N: speaking in half-whispers.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I missed you.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I missed you too. So much... But
D:           when the hell did you get to Delhi?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Well, I just came in on a train
D:           from Jaipur. It's a long story.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Jaipur? Were you OK? Were you lost?
D:           Oh God - did you drink any
D:           unfiltered water?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Don't worry. I only drank alcohol.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           And then you came here. To my home.
D:           And met my father--
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Who thinks I'm just a schoolmate.
D:           Also, if you were gonna make up an
D:           impressive job, couldn't I just be
D:           an architect. The hell's a building
D:           engineer?
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           You put me on the spot. I panicked!
0: 
N: Both Meena and Freddy realize that he was too loud, and
N: instinctively step back into their rooms, closing their doors
N: simultaneously.
0: 
N: Down the hallway, Sandeep's door opens once again.
0: 
N: He rubs his eyes, looks around, and then pops back in.
0: 
N: Freddy's door then opens. As does Meena's.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I'm here to win you back. So
D:           tomorrow, let's tell the truth. And
D:           be together. And then you can show
D:           me around Delhi.

C:                     FREDDY (CONT’D)
D:           Maybe we can see India Gate. I know
D:           it's tourist-y, but I should see it
D:           while I'm here.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Freddy. We discussed this. I'm
D:           terrified of how my parents would
D:           react. So, if we told them, we'd
D:           have to be 100% sure about each
D:           other. And right now, we're not
D:           even dating.
0: 
N: Freddy's enthusiasm deflates as she speaks.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Our situation hasn't changed. My
D:           plans haven't changed. All you've
D:           done is complicate things for me.
E:                (beat)
D:           Good night.
0: 
N: Before Freddy can respond, Meena closes the door to her room.
0: 
N: Alone in the hallway, Freddy slowly disappears behind his own
N: closing door.
0: 
N: And once again, the hallway is empty and quiet.
0: 
N: Freddy re-opens his door, waiting for Meena to do the same.
0: 
N: She does not.
0: 
N: However, down the hallway, Sandeep's door OPENS.
0: 
N: They make eye contact.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           Jetlag?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY

E:                (to Freddy)
D:           Oh nothing, buddy!
0: 
N: Meena punches Freddy on the arm as casually as she can.
0: 
N: Shree, confused, smiles and heads past them up the stairs.
0: 
C:                        FREDDY
D:           That hurt.
0:

D:           I'm not kidding around Freddy.

C:                     FREDDY
D:           Neither am I. I think I'm bruised.

C:                     MEENA
D:           You can't act romantic. At all.
0: 
N: Meena heads into the dining room.
0: 
N: Freddy, following behind her:

C:                     FREDDY
D:           Oh yeah. Cause I was gonna make a
D:           move on you over lunch with your
D:           parents. Who do you think I am?
0: 
N: And as Freddy and Meena disappear into the dining room:
0: 
N: The front door swings open and Kabir enters. Kabir is trailed
N: by Sandeep's driver, holding the door open for him.
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           Sandeep Uncle?
0: 
N: Sandeep eagerly sprints down the stairs toward Kabir.

E:                (spotting his own driver)
D:           Except mine who I trust with my

D:           Then it's settled. You'll spend the

D:           for the big party I'm throwing to
D:           welcome my son back to Delhi.

0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           Sandeep uncle. You know we started

0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           Ah, you should discuss this with
D:           Freddy. He's a building engineer.
0: 
N: The table turns to look at Freddy - who is mid-bite.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Yes. I became one very recently.

C:                     KABIR
D:           Then Freddy you'll love this. So
D:           we're building our factory, and
D:           there was an old temple or some
D:           ridiculous thing next door. And we
D:           were given two options. Either
D:           build around it. Or spend years in
D:           court fighting to demolish it.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           What did you do?
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           Option three. We tore it down
D:           without asking permission and paid
D:           the fine.

C:                     MEENA
D:           Surely there was a solution to both

C:                     KABIR
E:                (condescendingly)
D:           It was all very complicated.
E:                (to Freddy)
D:           And anyway, success is in always
D:           looking to the future. Not being
D:           stuck in the past.
0: 
N: Freddy takes a deep breath, gathers his thoughts, and:
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           With all due respect, you're wrong.
D:           The future's good and all, but you
D:           can't destroy the past. How can we
D:           know where we're going if we don't
D:           understand where we came from?
0: 
N: And with that, Freddy takes a bite from a parantha.
0: 
N: A smile ever-so-briefly flashes across Meena's face.

D:           You see, India - and this is a

D:           culture in the world. Before the
D:           British destroyed it.
0: 
N: Freddy keeps nodding along, getting just a bit nervous.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           They took advantage of our Indian
D:           hospitality. And they lied! Then
D:           they destroyed our culture. Took
D:           what was most precious to us.
0: 
N: Sandeep, caught up in the emotions of his speech, takes a
N: step a bit too close to Freddy.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP

D:           He'll have such a nice future with

C:                     ANAMIKA'S MOTHER
D:           And if Dev ever wants to give up

0: 
C:                     DEV
D:           You heard my father. Strong values.
D:           Families coming together. He'd kill
D:           me. And he'd kill you. And the
D:           disappointment and embarrassment
D:           would kill him.

C:                     FREDDY

N: Freddy flips back around, nearly running into:
0: 
N: Shree - who turns from her conversation to Freddy.
0: 
C:                     SHREE
D:           Oh Freddy. You really should meet

C:                        BASU
D:           Sure I do.

N: Shree looks around. Very confused.
0: 
C:                     PRIYA
D:           No, Basu! You must stop that!
E:                (to Freddy and Shree)
D:           I'm so sorry. He thinks all white
D:           people look the same.
0: 
N: All eyes turn to Basu... who instantly nods his head.
0: 
C:                     BASU
D:           Oh. My bad bro.
0: 
N: And Basu returns back to browsing on his phone.
0: 
N: NEAR THE TABLES: With Sandeep and her mother gone, Anamika
N: sits all alone - eyeing Dev and Freddy across the party.
0: 
N: And behind her, at the table next to hers, sits Kabir.
0: 
N: They both stare off in the same direction. Toward Freddy and
N: Dev - now speaking to one another off to the side.
0: 
N: Kabir notices Anamika, and turns half-way to face her:
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           Oh hi. I'm Kabir. Congratulations--

D:           Not really...
E:                (considering)
D:           But do you think there's something
D:           he's hiding?
0: 
C:                     ANAMIKA
D:           I'm afraid there may be.
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           You're right. Look. He's clearly
D:           here for... romantic reasons.
0: 
N: Still faced away from one another, Kabir doesn't notice
N: Anamika breathing deeply and shaking her head.
0: 
C:                        ANAMIKA
D:           I knew it.
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           And they're obviously keeping it a
D:           secret--
0: 
C:                     ANAMIKA
D:           Because people are so traditional--
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           I mean, I've kept relationships
D:           secret for the exact same reasons.
0: 
C:                     ANAMIKA
D:           Exact same? Oh my.
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           But see Freddy and I are after the
D:           same thing--
0: 
N: Anamika turns to face Kabir. She's shocked.
0: 
C:                        ANAMIKA
D:           Really?
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           But I won't let Freddy stand in my
D:           way if I'm actually starting to
D:           fall for this person.
E:                (beat)
D:           And it's not just because my dad is
D:           pressuring me into it.
0: 
N: Anamika's eyes go wide in bewilderment.

D:              Thank you. This was truly
D:              enlightening.
0: 
N: And Kabir walks off, leaving Anamika more confused than ever.
0: 
N: ACROSS THE PARTY: Freddy and Dev speak in hushed tones.
0: 
N: Until Freddy spots Kabir approaches and instantly peps up:
0: 
C:                        FREDDY
D:              So a building engineer is an expert
D:              in the design, construction, and
D:              maintenance of built environments.
0: 
C:                        DEV
D:              Wow, that definition sounds very
D:              accurate.
0: 
N: Kabir joins the two of them - facing Freddy directly.
0: 
C:                           FREDDY
D:              Hey Kabir.
0: 
C:                        KABIR
D:              Freddy. Listen, we need to talk--
0: 
N: But Kabir PAUSES as Sandeep walks up next to Freddy.
0: 
C:                        SANDEEP
D:              Hello boys!
E:                   (to Dev)
D:              Dev. Time for the speech.
0: 
C:                        DEV
D:              Papa, I'm not giving a speech.

C:                        SANDEEP
D:              This party is in your honor.
D:              Everyone’s here to celebrate you
D:              and... where’s Anamika anyway?
0: 
N: The four men turn toward the tables.
0: 
N: They spot Anamika sitting alone.
0: 
N: Dev waves.
0: 
N: She waves back - her face blank and her eyes wide.
0: 
C:                        SANDEEP
D:              Dev, someone needs to thank me for
D:              my party. I can't thank myself for
D:              my party.

0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           Let me say a few words. Introduce
D:           you and the happy couple. I truly
D:           don't mind.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           That's very thoughtful, my boy.
0: 
N: Not to be outdone, Freddy also throws his hand on Sandeep's
N: shoulder.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           And I'll speak too. See, this boy's
D:           pretty thoughtful as well.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           Right.
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           Sure. And then after I speak, I'll
D:           get the music started. Maybe show
D:           off my Punjabi dance moves, yeah?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Sure. Or I could do that too.

D:           No. You're so helpful.
0: 
N: Kabir and Freddy stare each other down.
0: 
N: Meanwhile, Sandeep stands in the middle. Very confused.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           Yes. You're both so helpful.
0: 
N: ACROSS THE PARTY: Meena walks up to Priya and Basu.
0: 
C:                     PRIYA
D:           Hey Meena. I spoke with Freddy and
D:           I've had a change of heart. I think
D:           all of this is now really romantic.

0: 
C:                        MEENA
D:           Seriously?

C:                     PRIYA
E:                (to Basu)
D:           You'd never fly to India for me.
0: 
C:                     BASU
D:           Why would I? You're already here.
0: 
N: Meena shakes her head, and begins looking around the party.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Wait. Where is Freddy?
0: 
N: She spins around and sees:
0: 
N: Freddy and Kabir standing on the dance floor.
0: 
C:                        MEENA
D:           Oh shit.
0: 
N: ON THE DANCE FLOOR: Kabir turns a microphone on and steps
N: forward, facing the crowd.
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           Hello New Delhi!
E:                (cheers from the crowd)
D:           Uncles and Aunties, you all look
D:           wonderful today! Now let's give it
D:           up for Dev and Anamika!
0: 
N: The crowd CHEERS as they all turn to find Dev and Anamika
N: standing an extremely awkward distance apart.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Yes. And also, of course, we have
D:           to thank our host. Mr. Sandeep.
D:           He's so welcoming. Especially to
D:           me. So welcome and accepting and
D:           inviting.
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           Everyone, this is Freddy. He's a
D:           tourist from America and--
0: 
N: Kabir then seamlessly transitions into Hindi.
0: 
N: Freddy looks at Kabir as he monologues. In Hindi.
0: 
C:                     KABIR
E:                (looking at Freddy)
D:           Oh. That means... Well, it'd be
D:           hard to translate.
E:                     (MORE)
0: 0:                                                                 75.
0: 
C:                     KABIR (CONT’D)
E:                (to the crowd)
D:           But Freddy mentioned he wants to
D:           get the music started for us. And
D:           that he'd show us his dance moves.
E:                (to Freddy)
D:           Take it away.
0: 
N: And with that, Kabir smiles and walks off the dance floor.
0: 
N: Watching all this unfold, Meena is pissed.
0: 
C:                      MEENA
D:           Asshole.
0: 
N: Standing alone on the dance floor, Freddy looks out to the
N: crowd - as every eye stares back at him.
0: 
N: Except for Meena. She looks away. Unable to watch.
0: 
N: Freddy nods his head. Then he half-turns to the band, saying:
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Gaana bajaao.
0: 
N: Meena's eyes fly up toward Freddy - just as wind softly
N: starts to blow in her hair...
0: 
N: And the horns behind Freddy begin to play...
0: 
N: And a drummer starts beating a giant drum...
0: 
N: Freddy starts to snap his fingers in rhythm as the beat picks
N: up. And Freddy starts SINGING-- in Hindi!
0: 
N: He sings about how sometimes you have to take risks.
N: Sometimes you have to shake things up. Jump to the front of a
N: crowd. And sometimes, you have to be the Life Of The Party.
0: 
N: Meena is in shock and cannot believe what's happening.
0: 
N: And, frankly, neither can Freddy. He wears a giddy, wide
N: smile as he suddenly starts dancing.
0: 
N: Background dancers jump onto the dance floor, but Freddy goes
N: beat for beat alongside them. He's jumping, sliding, and
N: pumping his shoulders like any great Indian dancer.
0: 
N: Soon, Freddy races forward - dancing into the crowd. As he
N: moves, the crowd jumps on their feet around him.
0: 
N: Freddy keeps the energy up, dancing on top of tables - and
N: jumping from one table to the next.
0: 
N: Meena is in a state of blissful disbelief.
0: 0:                                                                 76.
0: 
0: 
N: Freddy, meanwhile, has danced his way up onto the bar. The
N: BARTENDER lobs a bottle of whiskey up to him. Freddy catches
N: it and immediately starts pouring drinks for nearby guests.
0: 
N: Sandeep, holding his own bottle of whiskey, is lifted up onto
N: the bar. As Freddy keeps singing, the two men clink their
N: bottles together and take a swig!
0: 
N: Jumping off the bar, Freddy discovers THE ENTIRE PARTY IS NOW
N: DANCING!
0: 
N: Guests. Drummers. Waiters. Young kids and uncles and aunties.
0: 
N: Freddy dances through the crowd, passing by Meena...
0: 
N: She's dancing too, headed in the other direction...
0: 
N: Meena spins back toward Freddy, and they criss-cross again...
0: 
N: Finally, Freddy and Meena circle one another, and the moment
N: seems to slow in time. Their eyes locked on one another.
0: 
N: And as Freddy dances off toward the dance floor for the BIG
N: FINALE FINISH, Meena watches him go with a smile on her face.
0: 
N: Meena is in love.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. EVENT CENTER - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: The song has finished. The party is lively.
0: 
N: NEAR THE DANCE FLOOR, Freddy speaks with a GUEST - but his
N: gaze is elsewhere.
0: 
N: He spots Meena, standing across the party.
0: 
N: Freddy nods to the guest, and moves off - toward Meena.
0: 
N: When he's stopped--
0: 
N: Shree and two AUNTIES circle around Freddy.
0: 
C:                     SHREE
D:           Freddy! What wonderful dancing!
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Oh, thanks. Yeah I was just--
0: 
C:                     AUNTIE
D:           Are you single?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I'm sorry. Am I--? ... Yes.
0: 0:                                                               77.
0: 
0: 
C:                      AUNTIE
D:            My husband's business partner is
D:            American and he has a daughter...
0: 
C:                      FREDDY
D:            Oh. How nice.
0: 
N: Shree, noticing the air of awkwardness, cuts in.
0: 
C:                      SHREE
D:            Well, it was wonderful. Freddy, you
D:            had such joy inside. Really, you're
D:            such a good kid.
0: 
N: Shree lightly pats Freddy's cheek.
0: 
N: Freddy smiles. He turns to face--
0: 
N: Anamika.
0: 
N: She shyly looks up at Freddy.
0: 
C:                       ANAMIKA
E:                  (softly)
D:            I know your secret. And why you're
D:            here.
0: 
N: Freddy leans in nervously.
0: 
C:                      FREDDY
D:            You do?
0: 
C:                      ANAMIKA
D:            Yes. But I will not stand in the
D:            way of true love. Good luck to you.
0: 
N: Instantly overcome with emotion, Anamika throws her hands
N: over her face and rushes away.
0: 
N: Freddy stands alone - considering the previous exchange:
0: 
C:                       FREDDY
D:            Cool girl.
E:                 (beat)
D:            Bit dramatic.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. EVENT CENTER - LATER
0: 
N: Finally through the gauntlet of well-wishing guests, Freddy
N: and Meena meet at the center of the party.
0: 
N: They almost embrace, but with guests continually swirling
N: around them, they catch themselves.
0: 0:                                                                 78.
0: 
0: 
N: Instead, with a smile, Freddy walks up and stands next to
N: Meena. They stand side by side, looking out toward the crowd.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Why didn't you tell me you learned
D:           Hindi?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I wanted it to be a surprise.
E:                (beat)
D:           Surprise.
E:                (beat)
D:           I can be the kind of man you want.
D:           I could even be the kind of man
D:           your parents want.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           You honestly don't have to be
D:           anything you're not.
0: 
N: She turns to face him, and Freddy and Meena's eyes meet.
0: 
N: Their hands fall side by side, and her finger ever so
N: slightly touches his, before separating again.
0: 
N: She smiles.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Come with me.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. EVENT CENTER - LATER
0: 
N: Off to the side, Meena holds the hand of a woman in her 70s.
0: 
N: This is her grandmother. Her NANI.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Nani, Freddy mera dost hai.
0: 
N: Meena turns and introduces her Nani to Freddy.
0: 
N: Freddy steps up toward her, putting his hands together to
N: greet her.
0: 
C:                      FREDDY
D:           Nani. Namaste. Apse milker bahut
D:           acha laga.
0: 
N: Meena takes a half step back as Freddy and Nani begin their
N: simple, yet very sweet, conversation.
0: 
N: Watching this seemingly impossible event unfold, Meena is
N: overwhelmed.
0: 0:                                                                 79.

S: EXT. WEDDING LOCATION - EVENING
0: 
N: Barefoot CONSTRUCTION WORKERS climb incredibly strong bamboo
N: shafts, fastening together the outer framework of a tent.
0: 
N: Nearby, Sandeep sits alone on a bench - silently watching as
N: they construct his son's wedding venue.
0: 
N: From behind, Freddy walks up to the bench. Before Sandeep can
N: acknowledge him, he sits.
0: 
N: Neither man immediately speaks. Instead, they just watch the
N: workmen build the tent from the ground up.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           What can I help you with my boy?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I wanted to thank you again for
D:           your hospitality.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           No thank you necessary.
E:                (beat)
D:           But may I ask you something.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Of course. Anything.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           Does this tent look safe to you?
E:                (beat)
D:           In your professional opinion?
0: 
N: Freddy sheepishly looks off toward the tent.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           As a building engineer, I'd say...
D:           yes. But I would get a second
D:           opinion from a tent engineer.
0: 
N: Sandeep, confused, nods slowly and looks off toward the tent.
0: 
N: Slowly, Sandeep puts his head in his hands. He looks tired.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           You OK? Anything I can help with?
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           No. It's just Dev. I planned that
D:           event for him, and he didn't care.
D:           I planned this wedding for him, and
D:           he's dragging his feet.
0: 0:                                                             80.
0: 
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Maybe he doesn't want things
D:           planned out for him. Like, say, an
D:           arranged marriage. Maybe he wants
D:           more.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           More than what? Love? Because if
D:           you're with the right person, you
D:           will grow to love one another. And
D:           not just romantic love, which
D:           fades. But married love. Family
D:           love. Which is forever.
0: 
N: Sandeep turns and faces Freddy, fully engaging with him.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           You know, it was much stricter in
D:           my day. You barely met the bride.
D:           With my son, I let him go on dates
D:           with the girls. Hell, I was just
D:           the matchmaker. But I guess he
D:           resented even that.
E:                (beat)
D:           He's so modern. Both of my kids.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Is that bad?
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           No. It's amazing. It was my goal.
D:           To give them the life I never had.
D:           But I don't know how to find the
D:           balance between passing along my
D:           traditions and giving them their
D:           own future. I don't know.
0: 
N: Freddy nods, thinking hard before responding.
0: 
N: He pulls out his phone, pulls up his app, and hands it to
N: Sandeep.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I've developed my own app. It's
D:           about architecture and history
D:           and... it's my passion.
E:                (beat)
D:           But I couldn't have done if...
D:           certain people didn't support me to
D:           make something on my own.
0: 
N: Sandeep scrolls through the app's features.
0: 
N: Freddy sheepishly looks down.
0: 0:                                                                 81.

D:           Follow me.

N: Sandeep stands.

N: A moment later, Freddy follows.

0: 
S: EXT. QUTB MINAR - DAY
0: 
N: A massively tall minaret tower stands in the center of Delhi.
0: 
N: And Freddy stands below it - in complete awe.
0: 
N: He stumbles as he walks around it. Sandeep walks behind him.
0: 
C:                      SANDEEP
D:           Built in 1199, Qutb Minar is 240
D:           feet tall.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           It's incredible.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           You know Delhi has the maximum
D:           number of historical buildings in
D:           the world. Number one! Humayan's
D:           Tomb. India Gate.
0: 
N: Freddy comes to a stop, looking up at the tower.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Yeah. And I should probably see
D:           them all before that Kabir guy
D:           knocks them down.
0: 
N: Freddy looks over to Sandeep for his response, but Sandeep
N: remains stoic.
0: 
N: Until he eventually breaks, and CHUCKLES.
0: 
N: Freddy and Sandeep look back up at the tower. LAUGHING.

S: INT. ANAMIKA'S CAR - AFTERNOON
0: 
N: Anamika and her mother ride in the backseat of their family
N: car.
0: 
N: Lost in thought, Anamika looks out the window.
0: 
C:                     ANAMIKA
D:           Mummy, there's something you need
D:           to know.

S: INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - MEENA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
0: 
N: Meena enters her room, casually closing the door behind her.
0: 
N: But as soon as it shuts, she falls against the door, putting
N: her head in her hands and stomping her feet.
0: 
N: She works out every emotion. Shock. Passion. Excitement.
N: Giddiness. Literally everything plays out before our eyes.
0: 
N: But this is Meena. Calm. Collected. Logical.
0: 
N: So she slows her breath, and speaks softly to herself:
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Yes, he flew to India. And yes, he
D:           learned Hindi. And yes, everyone
D:           likes him. And yes, that includes
D:           Nani. And she doesn't like anyone.
0: 
N: Meena paces around the room.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           And yes he's sweet and charming and
D:           can dance. And yes, he takes my
D:           breath away. And yes, I missed him.
D:           And yes, I love him.
0: 
N: Meena stops in her tracks, but keeps speaking to herself.
0:

S: INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
0: 
N: Meena BURSTS out from her room. HORNS blare. Her hair
N: dramatically BLOWS in the wind.
0: 
N: Now she's the one under the spell, dancing down her hallway
N: and around the upstairs of her house.
0: 
N: Her SONG is classic old-school Bollywood. Her previous
N: rationality has given way to lyrics full of poetic hyperbole
N: expressing her deep undying love for Freddy.

0: 
S: EXT. FIELD - DAY
0: 
N: Meena looks around, no longer in her home.
0: 
N: Her daydream has taken her to a field of yellow flowers,
N: straight out of her favorite movie: Dilwale Dulhania Le
N: Jayenge.
0: 
N: She looks off in the distance. A man stands, turned away from
N: her. But it's not Shah Rukh Khan. It's FREDDY.
0: 
N: She runs toward him, and they embrace among the flowers...
0: 
0: 
S: INT. PALACE - NIGHT
0: 
N: But when they separate, they're no longer in the field. In
N: fact, they're no longer in color.
0: 
N: Meena has daydreamed herself into a 1940's Bollywood epic. In
N: full traditional outfits from centuries prior, Freddy and
N: Meena dance through the ornately decorated palace halls.
0: 
N: Freddy takes her by the hand, and spins her around...
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. FOREST POND - NIGHT
0: 
N: And now Meena finds herself near a moonlit pond. The
N: reflected lights sparkle in her eyes, like a heroine from a
N: Sanjay Leela Bhansali film.
0: 
N: Meena and Freddy stand at the edge of the pond. She looks
N: ahead, eyeing rocks in the water. Meena gracefully jumps from
N: one to the next. Following behind her, Freddy does the same.
0: 
N: Meena takes a leap from the final rock to shore...
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. TRAIN - DAY
0: 
N: Meena lands on a hard surface, barely able to balance

0:

0: 
0: 
N: Turning around, she finds Freddy. And without missing a beat,
N: the two start dancing on top of the train as it moves through
N: the Indian countryside
0: 
N: They dance CLOSER and CLOSER to one another...
0: 
N: They arrive face to face...
0: 
N: And as the SMOKE from the train's engine envelopes around
N: them...

S: INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - MEENA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
0:

0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           I just want to say... I'm proud of
D:           you. And the work you've been
D:           doing. And I know you want to run
D:           the business... so let's start now.
0: 
N: Meena can't believe what she's hearing.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           Modernize. Digitize. Globalize!
D:           Hell, we're an export company. We
D:           should have branches around the
D:           world. And you should start one.
E:                (beat)
D:           What about Chicago?
0: 
N: Caught off guard, Meena nods her head.

C:                     SANDEEP
D:           Anyway. Think about it.
0:

S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
0: 
N: As cars and taxis WHIZZ by, Freddy stands with Meena's family
N: near a pani puri cart.
0: 
N: The PANI PURI VENDOR takes a crisp, hollow fried ball and
N: uses his thumb to poke a hole in it.

C:                     FREDDY
D:           Is this sanitary?
0: 
C:                     SHREE
D:           You'll be fine.
0: 
N: The vendor fills up the ball with spicy flavored water and
N: chaat masala and hands it over to Freddy.
0: 
C:                     DEV
D:           Just plop it right in your mouth.
0: 
N: Freddy does - rather in-eloquently - and the juice runs all
N: down his shirt.
0: 
N: Just then, a car pulls in behind the family. Its headlights
N: draw their attention.
0: 
N: The car door opens. Anamika's Mother exits. Anamika follows.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           Ah hello! You didn't have to come
D:           here. We could've spoken at home.
0: 
C:                     ANAMIKA'S MOTHER
D:           This couldn't wait. I'm sorry...
0: 
N: Anamika's Mother searches for her words.
0: 
N: Anamika, meanwhile, stands quietly behind her.
0: 
C:                     ANAMIKA'S MOTHER
D:           You see. Marriage is like a
D:           retainer. If it doesn't fit
D:           properly after molding--
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           What's this about?
0: 
C:                     ANAMIKA'S MOTHER
D:           The wedding is off.
0: 
N: The group goes SILENT. Sandeep and Shree share a worried
N: glance. Dev looks to Anamika, who looks down at her feet.

D:           We have a difference in family
D:           values. And... and... and because
D:           of Freddy.
0: 
N: All eyes land on Freddy - who is quite shocked and confused.
0: 
C:                     ANAMIKA'S MOTHER
D:           He's been lying to you about why
D:           he's here. Making a fool of you.
0:

D:           You... you know why I'm here?
0:

D:           What? I'm-- no. No no no. I like

E:                (smiling)
D:           With Dev? Are you mad?
0: 
N: Shree, however, does not find any of this amusing.
0: 
C:                     SHREE
D:           Freddy. What were you going to say?
D:           Why are you here?
0: 
N: Everyone once again turns to face Freddy.
0: 
N: He gathers his thoughts. Does he lie? Tell the truth?
0: 
N: But it's Meena who closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Enough.
E:                (beat)
D:           He came here for me. Freddy and I
D:           dated back in America. We were in
D:           love. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
0: 
N: The sounds of TAXIS and BUSES fill the deep SILENCE.

D:           Freddy. I'll kindly ask you to not

0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           No. Let's discuss this. Is it

0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           It's not. No. No, it's because--
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Because he's different? And doesn't
D:           have the approval of your friends
D:           and cousins and business partners.
E:                (beat)
D:           And because you didn't pick him!

D:           And you're literally the only other
D:           people I know here.

N: Sitting across from Freddy are Priya and Basu.

D:           It's fine. We're happy to talk.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I-- I don't know what to do. I feel
D:           like I have nothing. No Meena. No
D:           sense of direction. No wallet. No
D:           battery in my freaking phone!
0: 
N: Freddy frantically pulls a charging cable from his pocket.

C:                     FREDDY
D:           My charger won't fit in any plugs!
0: 
N: Completely exhausted, Freddy puts his head in his hands.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           You know Meena. You know what she's
D:           going through. What should I do?
D:           Should I stay here? Maybe like a
D:           big, giant, grand gesture thing?
0: 
C:                     PRIYA
D:           Do you want to stay here?
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I want to be wherever she is.
0: 
N: Priya PAUSES - his words mirroring Meena's.
0: 
C:                     PRIYA
D:           ... then maybe ...
0: 
N: As Priya thinks of what to say, Basu looks up from his phone
N: and right at Freddy.
0: 
C:                     BASU
D:           Why did you learn Hindi and fly to
D:           India? Why do you want her family’s
D:           approval? Because the hard thing to
D:           do was the right thing to do.
0: 
N: Freddy nods his head.
0: 
N: Priya is in shock at the sheer eloquence of her husband.
0: 
C:                     BASU
D:           But now. Meena knows how you feel.
D:           And leaving and giving her space...
D:           that might be the hardest thing to
D:           do. But it would also be the right
D:           thing to do.

D:           But yeah, bro. You can have some.

S: INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - DEV'S ROOM - DAY
0: 
N: Dev sits alone on the edge of his bed.
0: 
N: Sultan jumps up on the bed, and the dog snuggles in beside
N: him. Dev pets Sultan, but even this offers no respite to the
N: pain he feels.
0: 
N: In the doorway, Meena watches.
0: 
N: Heartbroken, she walks in and sits beside him.
0: 
N: Staring off toward a far wall, he barely acknowledges her.

C:                     MEENA
D:           Dev. You're amazing. I mean that.
0: 
N: He looks up at her.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           And... I think I always suspected.
D:           Or thought. But anyway. I'm really
D:           happy I know.
0: 
N: She takes his hand in hers.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Now. Show me a picture of him.
0: 
N: He hesitates briefly, before pulling out his phone.
0: 
N: He opens a picture, and hands the phone to Meena.

D:             Then be with him. And tell everyone
D:             to go to hell. And--
0: 
C:                        DEV
D:             And be a hero? Love conquers all?
D:             Like in the songs?
E:                  (singing)
D:             Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya
E:                  (translating)
D:             If I'm in love, then why should I
D:             be afraid?
E:                  (beat)
D:             I'm afraid because I saw how they
D:             looked at me. They'll never, ever
D:             accept it.
0: 
N: Meena looks away, hoping - for several reasons - that what
N: he's saying is not true.
0: 
C:                       DEV
D:             I wish I thought otherwise. But I

0: 
N: Workers, standing atop the canvas roof towering 30 feet above
N: the ground, slowly deconstruct the wedding tent.
0: 
N: Sandeep watches from the same bench as before. He looks
N: exhausted. Worried.
0: 
N: He notices someone approaching, and momentarily looks off,
N: before returning his gaze back to the tent.
0: 
N: Freddy stands next to him.
0: 
N: Freddy takes a moment to gather his courage, and sits.
0: 
N: And for a few seconds, the two men sit in SILENCE.

C:                       FREDDY
D:             I'm sorry I lied. I truly am.
E:                  (beat)
D:             So here's the truth. I'm not a

0: 
0: 
N: Freddy looks for a reaction from Sandeep.
0: 
N: Sandeep keeps staring ahead.
0: 
N: So Freddy continues:
0: 
C:                      FREDDY
D:            There's a few more things. I may
D:            not come from a rich, well
D:            connected family, but you'd like
D:            them a lot.
E:                 (beat)
D:            My mom and dad wanted to call you.
D:            Sort everything out. I said it's a
D:            bit more complicated than that.
0: 
N: SILENCE.
0: 
C:                      FREDDY
D:            And... I'm not Indian. Obviously.
E:                 (beat)
D:            So you're disappointed that things
D:            haven't gone the way you imagined.
D:            That the life you gave your kids
D:            seems so unrecognizable.
0: 
N: Sandeep takes a pained breath, but-- still says nothing.
0: 
C:                      FREDDY
D:            But, for what it's worth, you
D:            raised good kids. Good Indian kids.
D:            Loving. Caring. Family-oriented.
D:            Who want to be with loving, caring,
D:            family-oriented people.
0: 
N: Freddy takes a deep breath. His confidence now regained.
0: 
C:                      FREDDY
D:            And I want to marry her...
0: 
N: Freddy stands, preparing to leave.
0: 
N: Sandeep barely acknowledges him.
0: 
C:                      FREDDY
D:            Can you do me a favor? Cause I know
D:            I've done enough intruding. And I
D:            wanna leave any decisions to her.
0: 
N: Finally, Sandeep turns and faces Freddy.
0: 
C:                      FREDDY

0: 
C:                     FREDDY (CONT’D)
D:           And tell her I hope I'll see again.
E:                (beat)
D:           Anyway. Bye Sandeep.
0: 
N: And with that, Freddy walks away.

D:           Open the gate.
0:

C:                     SHREE (O.S.)
D:           Close the gate.
0: 
N: Meena flips around and faces her mother. Shocked and pissed,

0: 
C:                     MEENA
E:                (to the guard)
D:           Don't.
E:                (to Shree)
D:           What is your problem?
0: 
C:                     SHREE

D:           please explain it to me!
0: 
N: Shree, taken a back by her daughter's tone, steps toward her.
0: 
C:                     SHREE
D:           I don't know him. I don't know his

D:           Who cares about culture?

0: 
0: 
C:                     SHREE
D:           Culture is tradition! And tradition
D:           is what I followed to have the life
D:           I love. To have you. Now, would I
D:           prefer if he were Indian? Of
D:           course! Because then I would know
D:           his values.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Oh, because Americans don't have
D:           values.
0:

E:                (motioning to the gate)
D:           You're literally trying to trap me
D:           behind a gate!
0: 
N: In control of the conversation, Meena steps toward Shree.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Growing up, I loved watching movies
D:           with you. And cheering on the
D:           heroes to fall in love.
E:                (beat)
D:           And it didn't matter if he was from

N: Beside her, Sandeep, Shree, and Dev all appear in various
N: stages of shock and exhaustion from the previous 24 hours.
0: 
N: Across from them, KABIR'S FATHER holds court - proudly
N: discussing his own achievements.
0: 
N: On one side of him, Kabir nods his head as his father speaks.
N: On the other side, KABIR'S MOTHER smiles dutifully.

C:                     KABIR'S FATHER
D:           They said it couldn't be done. Said
D:           it was impossible. But I did it. By
D:           God I did it. I created the largest
D:           plastic bottling plant for sodas
D:           and mineral water in the state!
0: 
N: Kabir proudly turns to Meena - who is completely checked out.
0: 
N: Shree and Dev, meanwhile, politely pick at their food.
0: 
N: Kabir's mother maintains the exact same smile as before.
0: 
N: So with no real reaction, Kabir's father keeps monologue-ing.
0: 
C:                     KABIR'S FATHER
D:           And when we expanded--
E:                (to Sandeep)
D:           Sandeep, you'll love this!
0: 
N: Sandeep forces an interested smile onto his face.
0: 
C:                     KABIR'S FATHER
D:           When we expanded, there was some
D:           little temple next door--
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           Oh, I already told them, Papa.
0: 
C:                        KABIR'S FATHER
D:           Boom!

0: 
C:                     KABIR'S FATHER (CONT’D)
D:           I mean, it wasn't really a
D:           temple... Well, it was. But you
D:           know these religious types.
D:           Beggars, all of them. So... BOOM!
0: 
N: Kabir and his father turn and LAUGH with one another.
0: 
N: But when Kabir turns back to Meena: still no reaction.
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           So, Meena. Did your buddy leave for
D:           America yet?
0: 
N: Meena looks up at Kabir - speechless.
0: 
C:                     KABIR'S FATHER
D:           Who's this?
0: 
C:                     KABIR
D:           Some American tourist friend.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           He's leaving tonight.
0: 
N: Meena, surprised, turns to Sandeep.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
E:                (softly, to Meena)
D:           He spoke with me.
E:                (beat)
D:           But he's probably already gone.
0: 
N: Meena nods. Accepting the inevitable.
0: 
N: Oblivious, Kabir's Father continues his endless one-man-show.
0: 
C:                     KABIR'S FATHER
D:           Americans. I've worked with them
D:           all. Extreme lack of culture.
D:           Barely speak to their families. No
D:           values whatsoever.
0: 
N: Shree looks up, hearing her own words tossed back at her.
0: 
C:                     KABIR'S FATHER
D:           But we Indians have our traditions.
D:           Our culture's intact.
E:                (to Sandeep)
D:           You and I, Sandeep, we can pass
D:           along these values because our
D:           children listen and do what we say.
0: 
N: Sandeep nods, continuing to bear this unbearable man.

D:           Meena? Meena?

N: stares at her.
0: 
C:                     KABIR'S FATHER
D:           I said, what do you think of that?
0: 
N: Meena looks around the table.
0: 
N: Kabir. Kabir's Father. Kabir's Mother.
0: 
N: Meena looks to Sandeep. To Dev. To Shree.
0: 
N: She nods her head, as if to answer, and--
0: 0:                                                              103.

0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           There's someone I need to see.
0: 
N: Meena turns to leave when--
0: 
N: Shree GRABS her wrist.
0: 
N: Meena looks down at Shree's hand wrapped around her arm.
0: 
N: And as quickly as she grabbed her wrist--
0: 
N: Shree releases it.
0: 
C:                     SHREE
D:           Ja, beta. Ja.
0: 
N: Every emotion hits Meena simultaneously. Joy. Shock. Love.
0: 
N: Unable to take her eyes off her mother, Meena stumbles
N: backwards away from the table.
0: 
N: She smiles toward Shree, and finally turns and RUNS.
0: 
N: From his seat, Sandeep watches Meena leave the restaurant.
0: 
N: He then takes his napkin, wipes his mouth, lays it on the
N: table, and stands.
0: 
C:                     SANDEEP
D:           I better go with her. Too late to
D:           take a taxi alone.
E:                (beat)
D:           Also, the deal's off. I believe we
D:           may have a difference of values.
E:                (beat)
D:           And your bottles are cheap.

0: 
N: She shrugs and stands.

C:                     SHREE
D:           Well, I suppose I better join them.

D:              Take a right, you bloody fool.

0: 
C:                        SANDEEP
D:              If he went straight to the airport,

0: 
N: Meena perks up, and turns to Sandeep.
0: 
C:                        MEENA
D:              He wouldn't go straight to the

E:                   (to the driver)

S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
0: 
N: As the taxi SCREECHES to a halt, Meena jumps out.
0: 
N: She's surrounded by people. Walking around. Taking pictures.
0: 
N: Meena wades through the crowd, looking for Freddy everywhere.
0: 
N: She pushes through a crowd of people, when she sees it:
0: 
N: INDIA GATE
0: 
N: A sandstone arch monument in the heart of New Delhi. Yes,
N: it's a little tourist-y. It's also incredibly beautiful.
0: 0:                                                             105.
0: 
0: 
N: But Meena looks everywhere. And cannot find Freddy.
0: 
N: Dwarfed below the massive arch, Meena hangs her head. She
N: closes her eyes, feeling the loss all over again.
0: 
N: When--
0: 
C:                     FREDDY (O.S.)
D:           Meena?
0: 
N: For a moment, she doesn't believe it.
0: 
N: But she turns, and there he is.
0: 
N: Freddy motions up to the massive monument.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I had to see it before I left.
E:                (beat)
D:           You were right. It's special.
0: 
N: With a big smile, Freddy steps toward Meena--
0: 
N: But she holds up a hand.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           No songs. No dances. No big
D:           speeches. Just... talk to me.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           OK. Let's talk.
0: 
N: Meena pauses a BEAT, collecting her thoughts.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I shouldn't have left America
D:           without fighting for us.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I shouldn't have come to India
D:           unannounced.
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I should have said so many things

0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           I should listened better--

C:                     MEENA
D:           I know things have been difficult--
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           It's only made me more certain--
0: 0:                                                               106.
0: 
0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           That I want to spend the rest of my
D:           life with you.
0: 
N: Freddy takes a step forward.
0: 
C:                     FREDDY
D:           Well, I want to marry you.

0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           I want to marry you too.
0: 
N: Inches apart, Freddy looks into her eyes. He leans in...
0: 
N: Meena tilts her head to kiss him before--
0: 
N: Her eyes slowly open, and she looks off to the side.
0: 
C:                       MEENA
D:           Freddy.
0: 
N: She motions to her right.
0: 
N: As her ENTIRE FAMILY watches from the nearby taxi.
0: 
N: Freddy waves to them.

C:                     FREDDY
D:           You brought your family?

C:                     MEENA
D:           Get used to it.

0: 
C:                     MEENA
D:           Papa, we want to get married. And I
D:           know that not everyone will accept
D:           this, but--
0: 
C:                       SANDEEP
D:           Nonsense!

C:                     SANDEEP
D:           Freddy. You're part of the family
D:           now. Which means you're Indian now.
D:           Which means we're not going to let
D:           anyone give you any shit for not
D:           being Indian. You understand?

C:                     SANDEEP
D:           ... since my son's not getting
D:           married this week.

C:                     DEV
E:                (smiling)
D:           Yeah... And you did essentially
D:           plan the whole wedding.
0: 
N: Meena, still freaking out (but also potentially weighing this
N: new, insane option in her mind), turns to Freddy.

E:                (beat)
D:           So you know my miles allowance?
E:                (a painful beat)

N: She takes a deep breath, and smiles back.
0: 
N: Drums. Horns. And MUSIC.
0: 
N: The song: WE ARE FAMILY by Sister Sledge - the greatest
