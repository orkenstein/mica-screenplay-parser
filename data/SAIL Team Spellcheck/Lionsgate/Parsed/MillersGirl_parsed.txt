S: INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - 5:30 AM
N: A cursor blinks on a blank computer screen. Text appears. I have nothing to say. The words are deleted. CAIRO SWEET, 17 and plain in a dark hooded sweatshirt, sits alone at a table in a large kitchen. It’s dark - the only lights coming from her computer screen, a dim bulb above a massive chef’s stove, and an expensive television hanging on the wall, playing NOW, VOYAGER on mute. She shuts the laptop and stares at the TV a moment. Grainy * black and white flickers cast shadows across her impassive * face. Behind her, the sun is just starting to rise gray-pink * in a winter sky. She unmutes the television just as Paul Henreid asks Bette Davis if they should “just have a cigarette on it” in the final scene of the film. Bette Davis and Paul Henreid are reflected in Cairo’s pupils. * Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 2. MILLER’S GIRL Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 3.
S: EXT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
N: The house is a massive white Greek Revival hidden in the * trees. A haunted place. A forgotten tomb in the woods. * Cairo shuts a glass door behind her. * We follow her down a long path overgrown with thorny plants * and dead leaves toward the porte corchere.
S: EXT. WOODS - EARLY MORNING
N: Cairo walks through the pathless trees. Mist hangs low and blue over the ground. Kudzu vines creep over everything. Eventually, she breaks through the tree line. Ahead of her is a brick building surrounded by dilapidated sports fields.
S: INT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MORNING
N: Cairo walks down the empty hallway of an old school that hasn’t been updated to the more industrial prison aesthetic of modern institutions.
S: INT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY -MORNING
N: Cairo passes several wooden doors to different rooms, finally stopping at one at the end of the corridor. ROOM 416 - MR. MILLER, CREATIVE WRITING Soft classical wafts from the open door.
S: INT. JONATHAN MILLER’S CLASSROOM - MORNING
N: SYMPHONY NO 6. in A Minor: 3 by MAHLER Thick oriental rugs over the floors. Lamps are used in place of overhead lights. Floor to ceiling bookshelves and portraits of famous artists cover the walls. Desks spread out in concentric circles around a large, mid-century wooden desk at the front of the room. A VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY banner hangs above a classic green chalkboard, on which is written MR. MILLER - CREATIVE WRITING in beautiful, cursive handwriting. Beneath that, a list of authors - Nabakov, Twain, DeSade, Vonnegut. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 4. Cairo chooses a seat in front and takes a stack of books from her bag, opening her library copy of James Joyce’s FINNEGANS WAKE. JONATHAN MILLER (elegant, warm, 30s) enters carrying a stack of freshly printed pages. He wears a uniform of camel and olive. He isn’t expecting a student this early in his class.
C: JONATHAN
D: Good morning.
N: She looks up.
C: CAIRO
D: Good morning.
C: JONATHAN
D: Class doesn’t start for another hour.
C: CAIRO I know.
D: I don’t like crowds.
C: JONATHAN
D: Do you live very far?
C: CAIRO
D: Just down the road, in Lovell Hills.
C: JONATHAN
D: Wow, nice.
C: CAIRO
D: My parents are lawyers.
E: shrugging
C: JONATHAN
D: What kind?
C: CAIRO
D: The expensive kind.
C: JONATHAN
D: Do you want to be a lawyer?
C: CAIRO
D: About as much as I want to be a high school student.
N: He considers her. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 5.
C: JONATHAN
D: What’s your name?
C: CAIRO
D: Cairo Sweet.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’m Mr. Miller.
C: CAIRO
D: I know.
N: He hands her the reading list for the semester.
C: JONATHAN
D: I assume you got this before the holidays - have you had a chance to look it over?
C: CAIRO
D: I’ve read it.
C: JONATHAN
D: I know it seems like a lot but I promise we’ll move through them quick enough.
C: CAIRO
D: I mean I read the whole list.
C: JONATHAN
D: You read these books?
C: CAIRO
D: Yes.
C: JONATHAN
D: There are eighteen books on this list.
C: CAIRO
D: I party hard.
N: WINNIE BLACK (17) enters as she would her own home. Every space is hers. She sheds bags and coats and food and paper until finally she is revealed - glorious, fleshy, femme. She pauses after her performance to give Jon a once over.
C: JONATHAN
D: Winnie.
C: WINNIE
D: D’ja miss me?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 6.
C: JONATHAN
D: No.
C: WINNIE
D: That’s too bad. Is J.Crew endorsing you for this?
E: re: his outfit
C: JONATHAN
D: Nice feathers.
E: re: her hair
C: WINNIE
D: You like? They’re sewn in.
C: JONATHAN
D: How do you wash it?
C: WINNIE
D: You don’t.
C: JONATHAN
D: Cool.
N: Winnie leans on Jonathan’s desk, facing Cairo. Jonathan writes the definitions for CENSORSHIP and SUPPRESSION on the chalkboard.
C: WINNIE
D: You’re overdressed as usual, I see.
E: to Cairo
C: CAIRO
D: Your underwear as usual, I see.
N: Winnie smiles and spreads her legs wider for Cairo.
C: WINNIE
D: What’s on the agenda today, Killer Miller?
C: JONATHAN
D: Nothing that will interest you, I’m sure.
C: WINNIE
D: Try me.
C: JONATHAN
D: Censorship.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 7.
C: WINNIE
D: Boring. Censorship is dead. It can’t exist with the accessibility of today’s technology.
C: JONATHAN
D: It’s not just the banning of books, Winnie. It’s the banning of ideas. And without ideas, what are we?
C: WINNIE
D: Instafamous.
C: JONATHAN
D: You’re not wrong. Do you know why?
C: WINNIE
D: Yeah, do you?
C: CAIRO
D: The ease of discovery puts the responsibility on the learner - ignorance is a product of laziness, not limitation.
C: JONATHAN
D: Perhaps you two should lead class today.
C: WINNIE
D: Or perhaps you could come up with something more interesting to teach, Teach.
C: JONATHAN
D: If you find my class so tedious, why did you elect to take it again?
C: WINNIE
D: I like your outfits.
N: Winnie sits on Cairo’s desk and her stomach growls, loud. She rubs her belly.
C: WINNIE
D: What’s that you say? You need a chicken biscuit? And a Coke? You heard the boss. It’s chickybisky Coke-y time. Let’s go.
E: CONT'D to her tummy it growls again to Cairo
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 8.
C: CAIRO
D: You know chicken biscuits are made of chicken, right?
C: WINNIE
D: So?
C: CAIRO
D: So I thought you were vegan.
C: WINNIE
D: New semester, new me.
C: JONATHAN
D: Let’s hope.
C: CAIRO
D: You want anything Mr. Miller?
C: JONATHAN
D: No thanks, Cairo. Sweet of you to ask.
C: WINNIE
D: I see what you did there.
N: Cairo and Winnie exit. Jonathan surveys the room and looks at the stack of books on Cairo’s desk. Finnegans Wake. The Paris Review. And UNDER THE ROOFS OF PARIS by Henry Miller. This surprises him. He takes the book and opens it. BORIS FILLMORE (30s, charming, smarter than he looks) enters with a pastry box and two coffees.
C: BORIS
D: Pretty suggestive for seniors, don’t you think?
N: Jonathan shuts the book. Boris sets his stuff on Cairo’s desk.
C: JONATHAN
D: It’s a student’s.
C: BORIS
D: What’s her name?
C: JONATHAN
D: How do you know it’s a girl?
C: BORIS
D: Boys are too lazy to read porn.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 9.
C: JONATHAN
D: It’s not porn. It’s not just porn.
C: BORIS
D: Every other word in that book is peen, poon, pee in the poon, pussy play peen poon and also anal. Gimme that.
N: He snatches the book from Jonathan and walks around the room, reciting. Jonathan follows him.
C: BORIS
D: “Marcelle wants me to fuck her. She leaps onto the couch and pushes herself between the girl and me...there’s something so fascinatingly horrible about her that I can’t move-”
E: CONT'D reciting
C: JONATHAN
D: Okay.
C: BORIS
D: “-I turn my back to get away from her when I feel her bald cuntlet touching the end of my dick-”
E: still reading
C: JONATHAN
D: OKAY.
C: BORIS
D: Tell me her name.
C: JONATHAN
D: Cairo Sweet.
N: Boris grins.
C: JONATHAN
D: What’s funny?
E: CONT'D
C: BORIS
D: She’s gonna be Valedictorian. Talk about porn.
C: JONATHAN
D: We’re not having this conversation.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 10.
C: BORIS
D: “Marcelle stretches her tiny split fig, holds it open and pushes it down against-”
E: resuming his recitation
N: Jonathan snatches the book back from Boris and returns it to Cairo’s desk.
C: JONATHAN
D: And that is quite enough of your elocution.
C: BORIS
D: Split fig is fucking poetry.
C: JONATHAN
D: Is that coffee for me?
C: BORIS
D: And a muffin too, if you want.
N: Jonathan takes a muffin from the pastry box. Boris goes through Cairo’s bag.
C: JONATHAN
D: Oh man, these smell - What are you doing?
E: he looks up
N: Boris holds a university press paperback with DDC numbers on the spine.
C: BORIS
D: Welly well well, what have we here - Apostrophes and Ampersands, six gruellingly romantic short stories by Jonathan Albert Miller. You’ve got a fan.
C: JONATHAN
D: She has my book?
C: BORIS
D: No one else could come up with a title like that. And she’s the only one who’s ever checked it out. That’s sweet.
E: he looks at the library card in the back
N: Jonathan takes this book from Boris as well and returns it to Cairo’s desk. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 11.
C: JONATHAN
D: Don’t you have a class to teach?
C: BORIS
D: I’ve got an assignment up on the television.
C: JONATHAN
D: That doesn’t count.
C: BORIS
D: Carl Sagan counts.
N: Boris finishes his coffee and free throws it into the trash.
C: BORIS
D: Those muffins are fresh AF, by the way. Made them this morning.
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: You have time to bake but not to teach?
C: BORIS
D: I have priorities.
N: Boris backs out of the room as Cairo enters. They bump into one another.
C: CAIRO
D: Excuse me, Coach Fillmore. Good morning.
C: BORIS
D: Morning, Cairo. Later, Brofessor.
N: Boris mouths “split fig” behind Cairo’s back.
C: CAIRO
D: Forgot my wallet.
S: EXT. JONATHAN’S BACKYARD - DUSK
N: Jonathan’s car pulls into the driveway of a modest craftsman home. He gets out and we follow him to a small enclosed backyard of unraked leaves. Off the side of the house is small, white shed. Kudzu curls over the top and around the sides in a slow, verdant smother. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 12.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S OFFICE/SHED - DUSK
N: The space is small and well appointed. Rugs cover the rough hewn floor. Shelves of worn books stack to the ceiling. Jonathan sets his bag on a built-in desk beneath a small paned window - its view obscured by a veil of green tendrils. Several vintage liquors line the windowsill. He takes a look through them and, grinning, grabs a Pappy Van Winkle.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - THAT EVENING
N: Jonathan walks in with the bottle and a single low ball glass. Sitting at a table is his wife BEATRICE (30s, rapier wit, minimal empathy). She types furiously on her laptop, a corona of Chinese food cartons spread around her. He sits down at the table and, with a touch of ceremony, pours himself a glass and looks up expectantly at Beatrice. She doesn’t notice. He takes a savoring sip.
C: JONATHAN
D: Are you gonna talk to me tonight or shall I continue contemplating my reflection in the back of your laptop?
C: BEATRICE
D: Sorry, I’ve been back and forth all day with the Nashville office who can’t seem to articulate what they want to my useless agent and think they can somehow articulate it to me, which is pretty ambitious considering they think articulate is a Danish cheese. So I’m gonna start scooping my fucking teeth out with a baby spoon, as that seems the most reasonable way to exorcise this day’s lunacy.
E: still typing
C: JONATHAN
D: You want a massage?
C: BEATRICE
D: I want a lobotomy.
N: She finally looks up at him. Notes the Pappy. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 13.
C: BEATRICE
D: Red letter day. Did Benson finally get computers?
E: CONT'D
N: He laughs.
C: JONATHAN
D: It got a writer. And she’s reading Finnegans Wake on her own, can you believe that?
C: BEATRICE
D: I’m forever stunned that the children in that backwater shanty can read.
C: JONATHAN
D: And guess what else?
C: BEATRICE
D: Infinite Jest.
C: JONATHAN
D: Apostrophes and Ampersands.
N: He grins.
C: BEATRICE
D: Look how proud you are, you’re so cute.
C: JONATHAN
D: She checked it out of the library.
C: BEATRICE
D: They carry your book at the library?
N: Her phone rings. She looks at it in dismay.
C: BEATRICE
D: Hark. A confederacy of dunces.
E: CONT'D
N: The conversation is over.
C: JONATHAN
D: Deep breaths. Happy place.
C: BEATRICE
D: My happy place has all of their heads impaled on Montblanc pens. Share your riches?
E: re: Pappy
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 14.
C: JONATHAN
D: Sure.
N: She answers the phone.
C: BEATRICE
D: Hello, Amy. What is it?
S: INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - EVENING
N: We follow Jon through the hallway of his house toward the kitchen. It’s an older home with books and art and dead plants crammed into every available space. He stops at a bookshelf and pulls down a well worn copy of Apostrophes and Ampersands. He opens it to the inside cover, where a dedication reads: For Beatrice June Harker. Every last word.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING
N: Jonathan puts some of the food cartons in the fridge and the others in the trash. Empty bottles of beer and literary magazines litter the counters. A record player sits on a table with another dead plant. He turns it on. SMOKES LIKE LIGHTNING by LIGHTNIN’ HOPKINS. His voice floats around the room like a ghost. He dances himself to a cabinet filled with liquor, chooses a bottle of Four Roses Bourbon and pours a couple fingers into a lowball glass. Beatrice comes to the doorway. He holds the partially filled glass out to her.
C: BEATRICE
D: You forgot the liquor.
C: JONATHAN
D: Liquor? I don’t even know her.
N: He pours a bigger glass. She smiles and saunters in the room, a drunk python.
C: JONATHAN
D: You ever read Under the Roofs of Paris?
E: CONT'D
C: BEATRICE
D: Honey I had to throw my first copy away, it got so sticky.
E: MORE
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 15.
C: BEATRICE
D: That beginning bit with the daddy and the prostitute and the cum money is filthy filthy fuego.
E: CONT'D
N: He hands her the filled glass and kisses her neck.
C: JONATHAN
D: I take the first bill I find in my pockets, wipe my cock on it, and lay it crumpled on her bare belly weighted with a coin.
E: reciting from memory
C: BEATRICE
D: There it is.
C: JONATHAN
D: You want to reenact? I can papier-mâché you with cum and money.
C: BEATRICE
D: Gross.
E: laughing
C: JONATHAN
D: We can crack you open like a pinata after you dry.
N: He unbuttons her blouse.
C: BEATRICE
D: You’re expecting a heavy load then?
C: JONATHAN
D: A full body of work. I’m the Kandinsky of Cum. The Brecht of the Boom Boom.
N: She laughs. He picks her up in his arms and starts to slow dance her around the room, singing along. She wraps her legs around him and they make out in the middle of the kitchen. Her phone rings.
C: BEATRICE
D: Oh for fuck’s sake.
N: Jonathan sighs into her neck.
C: BEATRICE
D: Take care of these dishes and I’ll give you a handy later.
E: CONT'D
N: She kisses him on the nose and slides out of his arms. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 16.
C: BEATRICE
D: It’s Pushkin not Pollyfuckinanna, Amy. I’m not changing the ending.
E: CONT'D answering
N: She walks back to the dining room, drink in hand, blouse unbuttoned. Jonathan adjusts himself in his trousers and turns to the sink.
S: EXT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - A WEEK LATER - MORNING
N: The sun is rising. Jonathan sits on the side of a brick building, smoking a cigarette. Boris sits down next to him with two coffees and a pastry box, which he opens to Jonathan.
C: JONATHAN
D: This is the best part of my morning.
N: They cheer one another with a muffin.
C: BORIS
D: Winnie Black’s the best part of mine. I like to play drinking games with her outfits. Cooter shot? Drink. Nipple slip? Drink. It’s a wonder I make it through my day.
C: JONATHAN
D: Without getting arrested?
C: BORIS
D: Without getting blasted. But I guess that too.
C: JONATHAN
D: Why do you always have to hold my coffee hostage?
C: BORIS
D: Because you’re a fucking puritan and I feel it’s my duty to punish the goodness out of you.
C: JONATHAN
D: You’re a sadist.
C: BORIS
D: I’m a public school teacher.
N: They both look out at the sun rising over the vine choked forest. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 17.
C: BORIS
D: Do you think there are ghosts in there?
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: Why don’t you go see?
C: BORIS
D: I don’t go in the kudzu.
C: JONATHAN
D: My granny told me to keep my windows shut tight so it couldn’t get me.
C: BORIS
D: It feeds on the souls of the dead. That’s how it moves so fast.
C: JONATHAN
D: Something about the verdancy of cemetery trees...
C: BORIS
D: It’s a Wallflowers song.
N: As they watch, Cairo emerges from the forest like a wraith. She listens to headphones. From Cairo’s POV, Jonathan and Boris cut figures of Vladimir and Estragon against the backdrop of the old school. She can see their mouths moving, little puffs of air evaporating in front of them. She approaches.
C: CAIRO
D: Good morning.
C: BORIS
D: Do you always walk alone through the woods?
C: CAIRO
D: That’s a peculiar question to ask a young lady, Coach Fillmore.
C: BORIS
D: I realize that, but do you actually? It’s dangerous in there.
C: CAIRO
D: Not for me. I’m a witch.
E: sotto
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 18. Boris squints, considering her.
C: JONATHAN
D: What are you listening to?
C: CAIRO
D: Celine Dion.
C: JONATHAN
D: Really?
C: CAIRO
D: Really.
C: BORIS
D: But...why?
E: horrified
C: CAIRO
D: Why not?
C: JONATHAN
D: Ignore him. He wept openly, aloud, to the Titanic theme song at our senior prom.
C: BORIS
D: Do vows of secrecy mean nothing to you? To the grave, man!
C: CAIRO
D: No judgement.
C: BORIS
D: I didn’t cry.
C: JONATHAN
D: You were disconsolate.
C: BORIS
D: Traitor.
E: butt-hurt
C: JONATHAN
D: Hypocrite.
C: BORIS
D: You want a muffin?
E: to Cairo
C: CAIRO
D: A what?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 19.
C: BORIS
D: Did I stutter?
N: She takes one and bites into it.
C: CAIRO
D: You made these?
E: impressed
C: BORIS
D: Yeah, but don’t tell.
C: CAIRO
D: Why not?
C: BORIS
D: You know.
C: CAIRO
D: I don’t.
C: BORIS
D: You’ll figure it out.
C: CAIRO
D: I won’t.
C: JONATHAN
D: Can’t have the baseball team knowing he bakes muffins and cries to Celine Dion.
C: BORIS
D: Well. Fuck me, right? You’re an asshole.
E: to Cairo to Jon
C: JONATHAN
D: I love you.
C: BORIS
D: This isn’t love, you monster.
C: JONATHAN
D: LOVE WAS WHEN I LOVED YOU...ONE TRUE TIME I HOLD TO...IN MY LIFE WE’LL ALWAYS GO ON...
E: singing
N: Boris flips him a double bird as he walks away.
C: CAIRO
D: Y’all are sweet.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 20.
C: JONATHAN
D: Something like that. Do you really walk through the woods alone?
C: CAIRO
D: Yes.
C: JONATHAN
D: Audacious.
C: CAIRO
D: Is it?
N: Jonathan finishes his cigarette.
C: JONATHAN
D: Yes.
S: INT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS
N: LATER Boris walks down an almost empty hall, checking his phone, humming the Titanic theme song to himself. He walks right past Winnie Black, standing at her open locker. She drops a stack of books. Boris turns.
C: WINNIE
D: Oops.
C: BORIS
D: Oldest trick in the book, Winnie.
C: WINNIE
D: It worked, didn’t it?
N: He eyes her. She grins.
C: WINNIE
D: Aren’tcha gonna say something? I dressed up just for you.
E: CONT'D
C: BORIS
D: If only that were true and legal. What do you want?
C: WINNIE
D: I wanna get into your physics class.
C: BORIS
D: Why?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 21.
C: WINNIE
D: I love electricity and neurons and stuff.
C: BORIS
D: You’re bored.
C: WINNIE
D: Ease my suffering.
N: Students and teachers begin to crowd the halls.
C: BORIS
D: You’ll be too many tests behind.
C: WINNIE
D: Don’t you tutor?
C: BORIS
D: You don’t need lessons.
C: WINNIE
D: Then what do I need?
C: BORIS A better education system.
D: I’ll see what I can do.
E: sighing
C: WINNIE
D: You won’t regret it.
C: BORIS
D: You might.
N: Cairo watches Winnie and Boris from the shadow of a doorway. They could be any teacher talking to any student. Boris walks away from a blushing Winnie and Cairo goes to her.
C: CAIRO
D: Whatcha doin.
C: WINNIE
D: I think I’m seducing Coach Fillmore.
C: CAIRO
D: Why?
C: WINNIE
D: He’s hot. And he’s nice.
N: Winnie closes her locker and they move down the hallway. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 22. A group of baseball players walks toward them in the opposite direction. One of them whistles at Winnie.
C: JOCK
D: What’s your going rate, baby girl? Been saving up my lunch money.
C: WINNIE
D: Hit me up when you finish growing out your vagina.
E: not missing a beat
N: The other jocks laugh at Winnie’s retort and continue on their way. Cairo barely notices. This is old hat to her.
C: CAIRO
D: You’re a lesbian.
C: WINNIE
D: I’m an equal-opportunist. Are you jealous?
C: CAIRO
D: If I say yes, will you lay off him?
C: WINNIE
D: If I say yes, will you lay on me?
C: CAIRO
D: You’re giving me mixed signals, Winnie.
C: WINNIE
D: We gotta lean in, you know? It’s how you build character.
N: They’ve come to the cafeteria.
C: WINNIE
D: Chicky bisky?
E: CONT'D
N: They turn and walk inside.
S: INT. JONATHAN MILLER’S CLASSROOM - MORNING
N: Cairo sits at the front of a full classroom, listening to a student stumble through a piece of text. Jonathan watches her. She feels his gaze on her and turns, coolly and openly meeting his eyes a moment before turning back to the recitation. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 23. Class goes on and Cairo watches Jonathan speak in front of the class. His eyes don’t meet hers again. Winnie watches them both. At the end of class, he passes out graded papers. A sticky note attached to hers reads: See me after school? Class lets out and she and Winnie walk out the door together. Cairo shows her the note and then folds it into her pocket.
S: INT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - OTHER CLASSES
N: We watch Cairo sitting in a series of different classrooms. She folds the note between her fingers as she listens.
S: INT. JONATHAN MILLER’S CLASSROOM - END OF THE SCHOOL DAY -
N: AFTERNOON Jonathan is attempting to grade papers while simultaneously having a conversation with Boris, who sits on Cairo’s desk, eating a power bar.
C: BORIS
D: This is nasty.
N: He tosses the rest of the bar out the open window. From below we hear student yell “the fuck?”
C: BORIS
D: How’s the book coming?
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: It’s not.
C: BORIS
D: You mean you’re not.
C: JONATHAN
D: No. Yes. No. She’s preoccupied.
C: BORIS
D: With how good I deep-dicked her in her dreams last night.
C: JONATHAN
D: I think you mean well and that’s revolting.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 24.
C: BORIS
D: What time is dinner?
C: JONATHAN
D: Seven. Please take a shower first.
C: BORIS
D: What, you worried Bea’s gonna get hot for this? This luscious sweaty man-meat?
E: he stands and rubs his body
C: JONATHAN
D: Top three worst nightmares.
N: Boris Roger Rabbits out of the room.
C: BORIS
D: I got moves. I got skills.
C: JONATHAN
D: You’ve got brain damage.
C: BORIS
D: Iiiiiiiiif you want my body AND you think it’s sexy come on darling let me know-
E: singing
N: Once alone, Jonathan sings along to himself and resumes grading papers. He dances a little in his seat. He looks up and immediately stops mid-lyric. Cairo stands in the doorway watching him.
C: JONATHAN
D: Hey.
N: She stifles a grin. He tries to be cool.
C: JONATHAN
D: Hi. Hello. Well that’s embarrassing, isn’t it?
E: CONT'D
C: CAIRO
D: I won’t tell.
C: JONATHAN
D: Generous. Thanks for coming by, I hope I’m not keeping you from anything.
C: CAIRO
D: Nah, I’m just waiting for Winnie.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 25.
C: JONATHAN
D: Seems like you’re always waiting for Winnie.
C: CAIRO
D: Waiting for Winnie. Sounds like a Gin Blossoms album.
C: JONATHAN
D: Gin Blossoms. What’s she doing?
C: CAIRO
D: Applying to Vandy, you’ll be pleased to know.
C: JONATHAN
D: Are you?
C: CAIRO
D: God no. Tennessee is a fucking tar pit. No offense.
C: JONATHAN
D: I think you’ll come to appreciate it when you’re older.
C: CAIRO
D: Maybe. From afar. As it burns. Like Nero.
C: JONATHAN
D: How far?
C: CAIRO
D: Stanford far.
C: JONATHAN
D: Because you wanna eat pot brownies and read Joan Didion all day?
C: CAIRO
D: Because I hear the literacy rate is high.
C: JONATHAN
D: Have you been to the Scroll Sessions at Mollie Fontaine’s?
C: CAIRO
D: What’s that?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 26.
C: JONATHAN
D: Poetry slam every third Saturday of the month down in Victorian Village.
C: CAIRO
D: What’s that?
C: JONATHAN
D: How can you disdain of Tennessee without having done a thorough cultural investigation?
C: CAIRO
D: Educated judgement.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’ve heard things there that haunt me.
C: CAIRO
D: Because they’re bad?
C: JONATHAN
D: Because they’re beautiful. Maybe you should go this weekend. I think you might be surprised.
N: She smiles.
C: JONATHAN
D: Let’s chat about this week’s assignment.
E: CONT'D
C: CAIRO
D: Okay.
C: JONATHAN
D: I asked for a first person short story from a social perspective different than your own. Your peers wrote varying articles about social hierarchies - some attempted a comment on classism, Miss Black delivered a scathing satire on popularity - and you wrote about a reluctant spider.
N: They look at one another. Then he recites her work to her. From memory.
C: JONATHAN
D: ‘Survival and desire amalgamated and turned an aphotic eye inward.
E: CONT'D MORE
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 27.
C: JONATHAN
D: I saw my expectations dismantled and dismembered by those harsh and starving dogs of reality - -the truths that sit in the vacuity of space like a hypergiant-star, burning to ash all elements too weak to withstand the awesome heat. We are what we are. And all creatures must eat.’
E: CONT'D
C: CAIRO
D: She’s not reluctant. She’s resigned.
C: JONATHAN
D: To her death?
C: CAIRO
D: To the order of things. She eats and also waits to be eaten.
C: JONATHAN
D: Is she you?
C: CAIRO
D: All fiction is confession.
C: JONATHAN
D: And what does your spider confess?
C: CAIRO
D: That the weak are made to be devoured by the strong.
C: JONATHAN
D: That’s dark.
C: CAIRO
D: That’s nature.
C: JONATHAN
D: That’s right.
C: CAIRO
D: You memorized it.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’m eidetic.
N: She laughs.
C: CAIRO
D: Are you really?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 28.
C: JONATHAN
D: It’s a good party trick.
C: CAIRO
D: I’ll say. Spider confession?
C: JONATHAN
D: I’m all ears.
C: CAIRO
D: I read your book.
N: Beat.
C: JONATHAN
D: Reviewers, of which there were three, found my work...overreaching. Ambitious without direction, to quote.
N: She thinks a moment.
C: CAIRO
D: I would describe it as grand and tragic. Romantic horror.
N: She looks into his face. CU on the wrinkles of skin around his surprised smile. He looks at her beneath his lashes. FLASH TO:
S: INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - CAIRO’S BATHROOM - FLASHBACK
N: Cairo sits in a clawfoot bathtub filled with pillows, reading the plastic sheathed library version of APOSTROPHE’S & AMPERSANDS. We look up at her from the page of the book. The text appears projected on her face. She recites his work aloud.
C: CAIRO
D: She was an electric white, noon- shadow moon casting cold light like water over the flat earth of my face - don’t look into the sun, they say, but the moon, the moon - I stared until I was nothing but a bleached bone monument beneath her, human ruins of a madman’s love.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 29.
S: INT. JONATHAN MILLER’S CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON
C: CAIRO
D: It’s the tickle boundary.
C: JONATHAN
D: The what?
C: CAIRO
D: Tickling is technically painful, but our brain tricks us into laughing as it tries to navigate the sensation of pain coming from someone we trust. How fucked is that?
C: JONATHAN
D: Is that true?
C: CAIRO
D: You know it is. You wrote about it. The horror of loving. The elation and the anguish. It’s why I wanted to take your class.
N: He stares at her, unsure what to say.
C: CAIRO
D: Too much? Is that weird?
E: CONT'D
N: He laughs.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’m flattered. It was the first thing I’d ever written that felt tangible. Like I’d touched something.
E: sincere
N: A moment passes between them - a silent thing that smiles and knows without question or answer.
C: CAIRO
D: Is there more?
C: JONATHAN
D: I haven’t written in a long time.
C: CAIRO
D: Why not?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 30.
C: JONATHAN
D: I don’t know. I got married. I started teaching. I didn’t have anything else to say.
C: CAIRO
D: You’re uninspired.
C: JONATHAN
D: Are you judging me?
E: teasing
C: CAIRO
D: No way. More like...challenge accepted.
C: JONATHAN
D: That’s my job. Speaking of which - You want a jump-start on the midterm?
E: beat
C: CAIRO
D: Yes.
C: JONATHAN
D: I want you to write a short story in the style of your favorite author. I think it could be the highlight of your portfolio submission to Stanford.
C: CAIRO
D: I think that’s a terrific idea.
C: JONATHAN
D: I hoped you would.
N: Winnie enters the room, dramatically dropping her bags to the floor. She’s got a thick painter’s portfolio under her arm, stuffed with loose canvasses. She drapes herself over a desk.
C: WINNIE
D: She wants me to have four new pieces in OIL. Four. Do I look like fucking Time Lord to you?
C: No. I don’t.
D: My shift starts in like an hour and a half and mama needs some snickity snackities, let’s roll.
C: JONATHAN
D: Hi, Winnie.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 31.
C: WINNIE
D: Mr. Miller? Is that you? I’m blind with hunger.
N: Cairo grabs her things.
C: CAIRO
D: I’ll see you tomorrow, Mr. Miller.
C: JONATHAN
D: Goodbye, girls. Make good choices.
N: They leave. Jonathan smiles to himself.
S: INT. WINNIE’S CAR - AFTERNOON
N: HEARTBEATS by THE KNIFE Winnie’s car is filled with crumpled paper, used books, and candy wrappers. Almost every available space of the interior - the ceiling, the doors, the console - is covered in art and language - an ever evolving art piece by the two of them. Cairo sits cross-legged in the passenger seat, paintbrushes and more food wrappers beneath her.
S: EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON
N: Winnie’s car pulls into a small country gas station.
S: INT. WINNIE’S CAR - AFTERNOON
N: Winnie leaves the car running.
C: WINNIE
D: You want anything?
C: CAIRO
D: A pack of Marlboros.
C: WINNIE
D: Okay, do you want anything for real?
C: CAIRO
D: That’s what I want.
C: WINNIE
D: Cigarettes.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 32.
C: CAIRO
D: Yeah.
C: WINNIE
D: Cigarettes.
C: CAIRO
D: ...Cigarettes, Winnie.
C: WINNIE
D: Okay.
S: INT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON
N: The Jock is behind the counter - not nearly as cool out of uniform. Winnie goes to the refrigerator and grabs a vanilla Coke, then to the candy for a Zero bar and a bag of jerky. She sits everything on the counter. Outside of school, Winnie and the Jock are different with one another. Kinder.
C: WINNIE
D: Hey.
C: JOCK
D: Hey Winnie. You want anything else?
N: He starts ringing everything up.
C: WINNIE
D: Can I get a pack of Marlboros?
C: JOCK
D: You smoke?
C: WINNIE
D: I might.
C: JOCK
D: You’re too pretty to smoke. My mom’s skin looks like a handbag.
C: WINNIE
D: It’s for a project. I promise not to inhale.
N: The jock grabs a pack of menthols and sets them on the counter. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 33.
C: JOCK
D: Show me your ID. Just for the cameras.
N: She does. He checks it and smiles at her.
C: JOCK
D: Good picture. It’ll be ten eighty.
E: CONT'D
N: She sets a ten and a five on the counter.
C: WINNIE
D: Keep the change. Buy yourself something pretty.
C: JOCK
D: See you at school tomorrow?
C: WINNIE
D: Game on.
N: She leaves.
S: INT. WINNIE’S CAR - AFTERNOON
N: Winnie drives and eats a candy bar. Cairo is doodling on the dashboard with a silver sharpie - a Henry Miller quote that reads: Everything we deny serves to defeat us in the end
S: INT. LOCAL RESTAURANT - EVENING
N: Beatrice, Jonathan and Boris sit at a table in the back of a family restaurant. An empty lowball glass sits in front of Beatrice, and various beers in front of Boris and Jonathan, who pick at chips in a basket. Winnie, wearing a her own very tight version of what the other waitresses are wearing, talks to the table. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 34.
C: BEATRICE
D: I don’t see any Michelin stars here, honey - what is the hold up?
E: annoyed
N: Her attitude doesn’t faze Winnie. She’s a pro.
C: WINNIE
D: Some stupid fuck up in the kitchen that was entirely preventable. Can I get y’all anything else while you wait?
C: BEATRICE
D: Another Makers.
C: WINNIE
D: You got it. Coach?
C: BORIS
D: Coors Light. Working late on a school night, aren’t you?
C: WINNIE
D: Drinking late on a school night, aren’t you?
C: BORIS
D: You think sassing me will get you a better tip?
C: WINNIE
D: It gets me a better grade. Another for you Mr. Miller?
C: JONATHAN
D: I’m good, Winnie. Designated driver.
C: WINNIE
D: Why can’t you be a nice, boring teacher like Mr. Miller?
E: to Boris
C: JONATHAN
D: Boring?
C: BORIS
D: And let my students make their grades on scholastic merit? Never.
C: JONATHAN
D: You think I’m boring?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 35.
C: WINNIE
D: In a good way. You’re like a nice pastoral.
N: She goes back to the kitchen.
C: BEATRICE
D: She’s cute.
C: BORIS
D: And a 4.0 student. And a talented painter.
C: BEATRICE
D: You like her.
C: BORIS
D: So do you.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’ve got her in my morning class. She’s a good kid.
C: BEATRICE
D: Oh oh - is this the last scion of Joyce?
C: JONATHAN
D: No, that’s Cairo. They’re best friends.
C: BEATRICE
D: Popular?
C: BORIS
D: Winnie is. Cairo’s a nerd.
C: BEATRICE
D: What a lovely departure she must be from the Future Farmers of America.
C: BORIS
D: Did he tell you Cairo read his book?
C: BEATRICE
D: He sure did. Is she pretty?
C: JONATHAN
D: She’s talented.
C: BEATRICE
D: Even worse.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 36.
C: BORIS
D: He’s prepping her to be his transcendence into the annals of academic glory.
C: JONATHAN
D: I feel like I’m finally getting to enjoy my job. It’s exhilarating to be so engaged, so -
C: BORIS
D: Worshipped?
C: JONATHAN
D: I can be meaningful in the career of a person who has something that matters.
C: BEATRICE
D: That’s nice, baby. I’m happy for you.
C: BORIS
D: Enjoy it while you can. Pickings are slim in the PS system.
C: BEATRICE
D: Rural education not as romantic as you thought it’d be, huh?
C: BORIS
D: I thought it was gonna be Friday Night Lights. Maybe even a little Legends of the Fall. But it’s just fucking bureaucracy. Red tape and homogenization and standardizing that leaves us sitting around with our dicks in our hands, regurgitating under-funded, outdated programs that do fuck-all for nothing and no one while the private schools are learning meditation and oat rolling and getting bonuses.
C: JONATHAN
D: I had no idea you had so many feelings.
C: BORIS
D: I wanted to be a teacher. I wanted to make a difference. But this is the public school system. We don’t grow presidents and peacemakers.
E: MORE
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 37.
C: BORIS
D: We grow celebrities and domestic abusers. You wanna make a difference? Grow a fucking tree.
E: CONT'D
C: BEATRICE
D: Cheers, Boris.
N: They cheer each other with the remainder of their drinks. Jonathan makes a face.
C: BORIS
D: The professor disapproves of my cynicism.
C: BEATRICE
D: He’s judging you.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’m not.
C: BEATRICE
D: Are too.
C: JONATHAN
D: The teacher who is attempting to teach without inspiring the pupil with a desire to learn is hammering on cold iron.
C: BEATRICE
D: Horace Mann?
C: JONATHAN
D: Ten points to Slytherin.
C: BORIS
D: You think I’ve given up.
C: JONATHAN
D: I think you’re placing the burden of inspiration on your students rather than being that engine for them. You have nothing to rise to, so you have nothing to earn.
C: BORIS
D: That’s rich coming from you. I wanted to be a teacher. You fell back on it.
C: JONATHAN
D: I love teaching.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 38.
C: BEATRICE
D: You’re much better suited for it, I think.
C: JONATHAN
D: Than what?
C: BEATRICE
D: Writing.
C: JONATHAN
D: What does that mean?
C: BEATRICE
D: You don’t have brain damage, we don’t have kids. You stopped writing because, I imagine, it wasn’t for you. Or, you weren’t for it. Otherwise you’d still be doing it.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’m a writer.
C: BEATRICE
D: You haven’t put pen to page since we were in grad school. You’re not a writer.
N: Jonathan is incredulous.
C: BEATRICE
D: I’ve hurt your feelings.
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: I didn’t realize you saw me that way.
C: BEATRICE
D: It’s not that you can’t write. It’s that you don’t. You chose to be a teacher, why would I see you as anything else?
C: JONATHAN
D: Because you married a writer.
N: She looks at him.
C: BEATRICE
D: I did, didn’t I?
N: She goes off to find the bathroom. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 39.
S: INT. CAIRO’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT EVENING
N: The bedroom is a cavernous, Gothic wet dream. All dark blue and green velvet, black painted hardwood floors, dripping candles. Cairo is staring her laptop, smoking a cigarette and ashing into a coke can. Winnie lays on a plush king size bed eating a popsicle. Her tongue is purple. Her work uniform is crumpled on the floor. She’s in her underwear and an oversized tee shirt.
C: WINNIE
D: So you’re a smoker now?
C: CAIRO
D: I’m smoking now. No plans for it to define me yet.
C: WINNIE
D: You like it?
C: CAIRO
D: It feels like something I never knew I was missing.
C: WINNIE
D: What do you want to do this weekend? I traded all my shifts.
C: CAIRO
D: You wanna come to a poetry reading with me?
C: WINNIE
D: I’d rather get fucked in a dumpster. Let’s go shopping.
C: CAIRO
D: I’d rather lick a city bus tire.
C: WINNIE
D: Let me dress you up.
C: CAIRO
D: I don’t give a fuck about being hot, Winnie. I give a fuck about being smart.
C: WINNIE
D: You can be both. What are you doing?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 40.
C: CAIRO
D: Willing my cursor to blink itself into my Stanford essay.
C: WINNIE
D: You dry?
C: CAIRO
D: Unqualified.
C: WINNIE
D: What’s the subject?
C: CAIRO
D: What has been your greatest adversity to date, and how have you overcome? The only legitimate adversity I’ve experienced was stomaching the grainy fois gras at Daddy’s forty-fifth birthday.
C: WINNIE
D: Don’t diminish it, your life is rife with adversity! Awesome absent parents and being an only child holed up in your mansion with your books and all. A hard knock life, indeed.
C: CAIRO
D: I imagine it’s about as hard as it is for you to wake up every morning looking like Fuck-Me Barbie.
C: WINNIE
D: It’s not that hard.
C: CAIRO
D: But it is. I have no interest in getting legacied into Yale and I’m sure as fuck not going to a state school and for double fuck not in this state. Which means I have to get in on my merit. But is a 4.2 GPA enough? Fuck to the no. Because we’re like, so super fortunate to grow up in a post 90’s politically correct clusterfuck, where hard work isn’t the winning ticket - tragedy is. They don’t give a shit if you’re smart, they give a shit if you’re sad.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 41.
C: WINNIE
D: You’re clever. You’ll invent something.
C: CAIRO
D: About what? On paper I am the most boring of all borings. I bore me.
C: WINNIE
D: You could write a treatise on teacher-student affairs.
C: CAIRO
D: Only if I made it first person. You’re not seriously gonna fuck him are you?
C: WINNIE
D: Haven’t decided. What’s it to you?
C: CAIRO
D: You really want Coach Fillmore to swipe your V card? He’s like twenty years older than you.
C: WINNIE
D: He’s only fourteen years older than me and so what? Older men have been harvesting virginity since the dawn of time.
C: CAIRO
D: So it doesn’t mean anything to you?
C: WINNIE
D: What?
C: CAIRO
D: Your virginity.
C: WINNIE
D: I mean, it’s meaningful, but it’s not necessarily romantic. I just want it to feel so hella good.
C: CAIRO
D: Then why not drop it for any of the rando plebes at school?
C: WINNIE
D: Why settle for lunch meat when you can have Kobe beef?
E: beat MORE
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 42.
C: WINNIE
D: We’re like, the fucking American wet dream. Young girls with ambivalent sexuality, pheromones steaming off our bodies - I don’t want some little jock-twat whose sexual standards are mandated by the shit porn he downloads. That’s deli meat. I want a dry-aged, perfectly marbled slab of hot man meat to take me to pleasure town. Oof. I’m hungry.
E: CONT'D
C: CAIRO
D: And you think that’s Boris Fillmore?
C: WINNIE
D: Why not? He’s fine as hell. And he’d take his time to get me good and juiced. And then he’d give me aftercare. I know what I’m looking for. And I think I know what Mr. Miller’s looking for.
E: Cairo makes a face
C: CAIRO
D: What does that mean?
C: WINNIE
D: He sees you. Even though you hide in plain sight.
C: CAIRO
D: Shut up. Tell me more.
C: WINNIE
D: Like you haven’t noticed. It’s like he’s been living in gray-scale and you’re the first thing he’s seen in color.
N: Cairo smiles, just a little.
C: WINNIE
D: C’mere.
E: CONT'D
N: Winnie drags Cairo to the mirror. She undoes her knotted hair and pulls Cairo’s sweatshirt tight against her form.
C: WINNIE
D: I’d fuck you.
E: CONT'D
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 43.
C: CAIRO
D: I know.
N: Winnie and Cairo both appreciate her form in the mirror. It’s intimate.
C: WINNIE
D: Make him love you.
C: CAIRO
D: For what?
C: WINNIE
D: For sport. For love, if you like. I’ll get BFill and you get JMill. Oh my God, rhyme schemes are the best schemes.
C: CAIRO
D: I don’t want him to fuck me, I want him to respect me.
C: WINNIE
D: Guess what?
C: CAIRO
D: He can do both.
E: rolling her eyes
C: WINNIE
D: The student becomes the master.
C: CAIRO
D: I don’t have to dress up to make a man to like me.
C: WINNIE
D: You’d wear armor into battle wouldn’t you?
C: CAIRO
D: Are we going to war?
N: Winnie rests her head on Cairo’s shoulder and her arms around Cairo’s waist.
C: WINNIE
D: Join the revolution. Be smart and pretty. It’s totes the American way.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 44.
S: EXT. MOLLIE FONTAINE’S - DAY
N: The sky is bruise purple and fat with unlet rain. Cairo walks toward a large, gilded Victorian house. A sign out front says SCROLL SESSIONS: 2:00 PM. She walks up the front steps and into the house.
S: INT. MOLLIE FONTAINE’S - DAY
N: Stained glass windows kaleidoscope a wide foyer aswarm with hipsters and academics. A long table is set with wine and snacks. Cairo walks over to it and takes a glass of red. A woman in a calico dress speaks to the group. This is SUZETTE (30s).
C: SUZETTE
D: If y’all want to make your way into the parlor and grab a seat, we’ll begin in five minutes.
C: HIPSTER
D: Thank you, Five!
N: The room politely giggles.
S: INT. MOLLIE FONTAINE’S - PARLOR - DAY
N: Cairo moves into the parlor before anyone else and snags a low velvet loveseat in the back. A podium is set before a large fireplace and various chairs are smattered about the room. A baby grand is positioned in front of a bay window. Taper candles illuminate the room. And it begins to rain. People enter and take their seats. They all clearly know one another and Cairo observes their casual intimacy with casual detachment. She feels a presence behind her. A beautiful mouth leans to her ear and whispers.
C: JONATHAN
D: Her Majesty has ventured among the people.
E: O.C.
N: She turns to the familiar sound. Jonathan squats behind the couch, his face close to hers. His hair is wet. He smiles at her, all warmth and satisfaction glowing all over her.
C: CAIRO
D: Hi. You’re wet.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 45. He flips his hair at her, spraying droplets on her face.
C: JONATHAN
D: So are you. May I sit?
E: he grins
N: She nods. He does. They are close on the small couch. A few people in front of them say hello to him.
C: CAIRO
D: Do you know all of these people?
C: JONATHAN
D: Most of them. We’ve been coming here for a couple of years now.
C: CAIRO
D: What, like group therapy?
C: JONATHAN
D: Yes, exactly like that. Whatcha got there, young lady?
E: re: the wine in her hand
C: CAIRO
D: Sacramental grape juice.
C: JONATHAN
D: Said the lawyer's daughter.
N: Suzette sits at the piano.
C: CAIRO
D: Who’s that?
C: JONATHAN
D: Suzette. She’s the youngest person ever to play with the Tennessee Philharmonic.
C: CAIRO
D: Is she a writer?
C: JONATHAN
D: You’ll see.
N: The room falls silent. Suzette plays NOCTURNE NO. 2 in C MINOR by JOHN FIELD. Over the song, Cairo and Jonathan watch as various people approach the podium to speak. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 46. Both are visibly moved by whatever it is they’re hearing. Jonathan watches her...his eyes trace her eyelashes, her nose, the curve of her lips and neck. She turns to him then, eyes shining with emotion. They stare at one another the way one does a painting in a museum that resembles them - with the wonder of how someone knew their face three hundred years ago. The room erupts in applause and everyone stands but them. They are only what they are, there, on a couch together in a Victorian house in Tennessee. Two little ghosts in recognition.
S: INT. MOLLIE FONTAINE’S - PORCH - DAY
N: Heavy rain creates a cocoon of white noise. Jonathan and Cairo stand alone in a screened porch. They each have a glass of wine. They each are a little buzzed.
C: CAIRO I concede.
D: That was really something.
N: Jonathan laughs, delighted.
C: JONATHAN
D: Hotdog. You thought it was gonna be trash, didn’t you?
C: CAIRO
D: I admit, my expectations were limited.
N: She lights a cigarette.
C: JONATHAN
D: You smoke?
C: CAIRO
D: Don’t you?
N: She passes it to him. Trying on casual intimacy.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’m real glad you liked it.
C: CAIRO
D: You ever read at these?
C: JONATHAN
D: Only a couple of times, early on.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 47.
C: CAIRO
D: What a waste. You’re better than everyone I heard this afternoon and these people moved me.
C: JONATHAN
D: You’re just saying that so I don’t tell on you for drinkin’ and smokin’ and cussin’.
C: CAIRO
D: I say only what I mean.
N: They look at each other. Thunder crashes. Cairo turns to look out at the rain. Smoke haloes around her.
S: INT. BENSON HIGH SCHOOL - OUTSIDE - FRIDAY MORNING
N: Jonathan and Boris sit in their usual location. Jonathan smokes a cigarette. The sun is rising.
C: JONATHAN
D: It’s not that cold. Don’t be such a puss.
C: BORIS
D: I can see my breath.
C: JONATHAN
D: Then go inside.
C: BORIS
D: And miss Godot?
C: JONATHAN
D: Soon’t yourself.
C: BORIS
D: Did you just say ‘soon’t’?
C: JONATHAN
D: How do you say it?
C: BORIS
D: Suit. I say suit. Because one would suit oneself, not soon’t, whatever the hell that is.
C: JONATHAN
D: That’s what I said. Shut up.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 48.
S: INT. WINNIE’S CAR - MORNING
N: Cairo sits in the passenger seat, holding a tray of three coffees in her lap. Her hair is down, her make up is done. She looks...adult.
C: WINNIE
D: How do you feel?
E: admiring
N: Cairo takes a deep breath.
C: CAIRO
D: Visible.
C: WINNIE
D: Ain’t no use in keepin’ that light under a bushel. Now get out of my car so I can watch’at ass walk away.
N: Cairo grins and gets out. Winnie rolls down her window to cat call her.
C: WINNIE
D: Tryna get to yoooooou and dat booty-
E: CONT'D singing
S: EXT. BENSON HIGH SCHOOL - OUTSIDE - MORNING
N: Cairo rounds the corner of the building.
C: CAIRO
D: Gifts for the wallflowers.
N: She offers them the tray.
C: BORIS
D: What’s this?
C: CAIRO
D: It’s coffee.
C: BORIS
D: No, no. What is this I see before me? You look like a girl.
C: CAIRO
D: Like a big girl?
E: cheeky
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 49.
C: BORIS
D: Yes ma’am, you clean up good. Got a big date?
C: CAIRO
D: Nope.
C: BORIS
D: Presentation in class?
C: CAIRO
D: Nope.
C: BORIS
D: Get laid?
C: JONATHAN
D: OKAY.
C: BORIS
D: I like it.
C: JONATHAN
D: Thank you for this. It’s very generous.
E: re: coffee
C: CAIRO
D: No one should have to suffer cafeteria coffee.
C: BORIS
D: Muffin, muffin?
N: Boris opens a white pastry box to her.
C: CAIRO
D: Oh my God, these smell incredible. What flavor?
C: BORIS
D: Split fig.
N: Jonathan chokes on his coffee. Cairo stifles a grin.
C: CAIRO
D: You should get a logo and sell these to raise money for the team. Don’t you laugh! You’d buy some, wouldn’t you Mr. Miller?
E: Boris laughs
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 50.
C: JONATHAN
D: I can’t resist a cute boy with a muffin.
C: CAIRO
D: Winnie could design it for you, you know. She’s great at that stuff. Coach. You could call yourself the Muffin Man.
E: inspired beat
C: JONATHAN
D: Nice.
C: CAIRO
D: Winnie and I could help you get it off the ground.
C: BORIS
D: What’s in it for you?
C: CAIRO
D: Work experience on our college apps.
C: BORIS
D: Would you really buy my muffins?
C: JONATHAN
D: Why pay for what I already get for free?
C: CAIRO
D: I would. All the girls would.
N: He thinks a moment.
C: BORIS
D: I’m the Muffin Man.
C: CAIRO
D: Once more with pride!
C: BORIS
D: I’m the motherfucking Muffin Man!
N: She throws up a hand for a high-five and he returns it.
C: CAIRO
D: Go live your dreams, Coach.
C: BORIS
D: Good goddamn you’re smart.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 51. Cairo shrugs and smiles. Boris jumps up and down a little in the cold.
C: BORIS
D: It’s colder’n wearin’ a brass bra on the shady side of an iceberg out here. Y’all coming in?
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: Nah, I’m gonna have one more. You go ahead.
C: BORIS
D: Soon’t yourself, Brohan. Thanks again. For the all the pick- me-ups you brought this morning.
E: to Cairo
N: Boris leaves.
C: JONATHAN
D: You’re sweet.
C: CAIRO
D: When it suits.
N: Jonathan opens his pack of Camels to her. She opens her pack to him.
C: CAIRO
D: Set higher standards, Mr. Miller. Have a menthol.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. BENSON HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER
N: Jonathan is exiting the teacher’s lounge with a sludgy cup of coffee when his phone dings with a text from Beatrice: B: Weekend getaway? xxx His face registers happy surprise. He responds: J: For real? B: Amy’s been fucking me long enough. Your turn. Hurry home. Jon is interrupted by the sound of high heels approaching. He looks up to see JOYCE MANNER, VICE PRINCIPAL (sharp, 50s).
C: JOYCE
D: Texting in the halls is a punishable offense, Mr. Miller.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 52.
C: JONATHAN
D: Oh excuse me, Vice Principal Manner.
C: JOYCE
D: I hope it was worth it.
N: He blushes.
C: JOYCE
D: It was. I won’t tell the Principal.
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: How’re you settling into the new gig? Better than 10th grade English?
C: JOYCE
D: I only get to talk to people who are in trouble. I think this job may have been a lateral move.
C: JONATHAN
D: Bummer. Well you look great.
C: JOYCE
D: Thanks, I bathe in the blood of underachievers. How’s the magical world of an elective class? Must be charming what with your kids choosing to take your course and all.
C: JONATHAN
D: Yeah, it’s strong this year.
C: JOYCE
D: Your student reviews were outstanding. Are you giving them weed?
C: JONATHAN
D: Say nope to dope, Joyce.
C: JOYCE
D: I say a friend with weed is a friend indeed.
C: JONATHAN
D: Do you?
C: JOYCE
D: No. But I like that it rhymes. Who’s manning your class right now?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 53.
C: JONATHAN
D: Ah, the tools of the future.
C: JOYCE
D: You’re streaming a movie, aren’t you?
C: JONATHAN
D: Dead Poet’s Society.
C: JOYCE
D: O Captain, my Captain, your class is probably sleeping.
C: JONATHAN
D: Yeah, I should get back. Catch you around, boss.
C: JOYCE
D: Only if you fuck up.
S: INT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - THAT
N: AFTERNOON School has let out and kids are shouting in the hallways, ready for the weekend. Cairo is putting books away in her locker. Winnie stands next to her, playing on her phone.
C: WINNIE
D: What did he say?
C: CAIRO
D: He didn’t have to say anything.
E: smiling
N: The baseball player entourage walks past the girls. The JOCK smiles at Winnie.
C: JOCK
D: Coming to the game, ladies? I’ll let you hold my bat.
C: WINNIE
D: If I wanted to hold a tampon, I’d just pull it out of your pussy.
C: JOCK
D: Fuck you, Winnie.
C: WINNIE
D: Omigod, your whole vocabulary in one sentence! Come fuck me with that big nasty rhetoric, jock-twat.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 54. Winnie humps the air. The JOCK flips her off and continues on his way.
C: WINNIE
D: You ready?
E: CONT'D
C: CAIRO
D: I’ve got to run by Mr. Miller’s room first.
C: WINNIE
D: Can I watch?
N: Cairo shuts her locker.
C: CAIRO
D: With pleasure.
S: INT. JONATHAN MILLER’S CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Winnie is on her phone by the door, keeping a watchful eye on the scene. Cairo enters the room. Jonathan packs his bag and shuts down his computer. He’s happy to see her, but hurried.
C: JONATHAN
D: Hey, kid. How are you?
N: She sets her things on her desk.
C: CAIRO
D: Hey. You in a hurry?
C: JONATHAN
D: Headed on a little weekend vacation with my wife.
C: CAIRO
D: What do writers do on vacation?
C: JONATHAN
D: Pretend to write in a different location, I guess.
N: Winnie’s in the door. It’s a dance for them to be alone together.
C: CAIRO
D: Can we talk about the midterm?
C: JONATHAN
D: Of course. What’s on your mind?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 55. He has all of his things in order. He comes around and sets his stuff on Cairo’s desk. They stand close.
C: CAIRO
D: I want your approval on my author before I start.
C: JONATHAN
D: Okay, who is it?
C: CAIRO
D: Henry Miller.
C: JONATHAN
D: Provocative.
C: CAIRO
D: I can justify him.
C: JONATHAN
D: His structure is challenging to emulate.
C: CAIRO
D: It’s not just structural though, it’s everything - his decadence, his total disregard for literary etiquette, his destruction of convention. You know. The good stuff.
N: He raises an eyebrow at her.
C: CAIRO
D: You don’t think I can do it.
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: Miller is public enemy no. 1 to the censors - he’s top of the list we discussed at the start of the semester. He’s controversial.
C: CAIRO
D: Yeah, and I’m applying to Stanford. If it’s not controversial, it’s not interesting.
C: JONATHAN
D: Okay.
C: CAIRO
D: Okay yes?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 56.
C: JONATHAN
D: I trust you.
N: A moment of suspension passes between them - Cairo smiles and he returns it a moment before remembering himself. He gathers his stuff.
C: JONATHAN
D: I gotta go.
E: CONT'D
C: CAIRO
D: I know.
C: JONATHAN
D: Try and do something fun this weekend, okay? Take a recess.
C: CAIRO
D: I’ll rest if you write.
N: He walks to the door, then stops. Winnie is still on the phone.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’ll see you Monday. Bye Winnie.
N: He exits. Winnie drops her phone (that she wasn’t even on) and runs over to Cairo.
C: WINNIE
D: But like...omigod. Y’all are...on.
C: CAIRO
D: Don’t be gross.
N: Winnie hikes up her skirt and bends over Jonathan’s desk suggestively.
C: WINNIE
D: Oh Mr. Miller...I just love the decadence and the words and breaking all the rules.
N: She throws herself on the desk like a naughty school girl. Boris comes to the door but they don’t see him.
C: CAIRO
D: I didn’t say it like that.
C: WINNIE
D: You thought it like that. We make a good double-team-team, huh? Seduction game ON POINT.
E: Cairo rolls her eyes
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 57.
C: CAIRO
D: I am not trying to seduce Mr. Miller. I’m trying to get into college.
C: BORIS
D: Am I interrupting?
N: Winnie slowly gets off the desk and pulls down her skirt. The action is not lost on Boris.
C: CAIRO
D: We were just leaving.
C: BORIS
D: Cairo - I think your idea is whiz- bang. And I’d love your help too, Winnie.
C: WINNIE
D: With what?
C: BORIS
D: Can you keep a secret?
C: WINNIE
D: Sure can’t.
N: Beat.
C: BORIS
D: I bake muffins.
C: CAIRO
D: And he’s going to have the baseball team sell them to raise money and they’re going to call themselves the Muffin Men and he wants you to design the logo.
N: Winnie takes a moment.
C: WINNIE
D: I think that’s really cool.
C: BORIS
D: You do?
E: surprised
C: WINNIE
D: It’s fun to be good at something. I’d love to help.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 58.
C: BORIS
D: Cool. Well. I guess I’ll call you girls out on your lunch and we can go over the specs-
E: grinning
C: WINNIE
D: Here. Give me your phone and I’ll put myself in. It’ll be a lot faster if I can just text you ideas.
N: He hands Winnie his phone. Cairo digs through her bag looking for her own.
C: BORIS
D: Great. Thank you.
C: CAIRO
D: Can you call me?
N: Winnie punches on his phone.
C: WINNIE
D: And now you’ll have Cairo’s number as well. It’s going to voicemail.
E: she listens a moment
C: CAIRO
D: Shit.
N: Winnie hangs up and stuffs Boris’s phone in her bra.
C: WINNIE
D: Whatever, I’m sure it’s in the bottom of your bag.
C: CAIRO
D: I just had it a minute ago.
C: WINNIE
D: It’s Friday and we’re still here. Let’s a-fucking go.
N: She starts to haul Cairo out of the room.
C: BORIS
D: Uh, Winnie?
C: WINNIE
D: Uh, Boris.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 59.
C: BORIS
D: My phone?
C: WINNIE
D: My phone?
C: BORIS
D: Your phone?
C: WINNIE
D: Your phone? Your phone.
N: She pulls his phone from her bra.
C: WINNIE
D: Right. Sorry.
E: CONT'D
N: She hands it to him and it shocks him.
C: WINNIE
D: Danger danger high voltage.
E: CONT'D
N: He smirks.
C: BORIS
D: See you later girls.
N: Winnie and Cairo leave, arm in arm. Once out of ear shot:
C: CAIRO
D: You’re unbelievable.
C: WINNIE
D: I’m practically a professional.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
N: Suitcases are packed and ready to go by the back door. Jonathan reads ON WRITING by STEPHEN KING. Beatrice is on her phone.
C: BEATRICE
E: On the phone
C: Yeah, I fucking know.
D: I’m sorry, just a few more minutes.
E: to Jon
C: JONATHAN
D: We were supposed to leave forty minutes ago.
N: Beatrice walks away. Jonathan goes back to his book. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 60. The intro to POPPIN MY COLLAR by THREE 6 MAFIA emanates from his bag. He stares at it. It stops. It starts again. Jonathan sticks his hand inside and retrieves a cell phone.
C: JONATHAN
D: Hello?
E: CONT'D answering
N: INTERCUT between CAIRO’S HOUSE and JONATHAN’S KITCHEN. Cairo sits outside on a terrace overgrown with ivy and covered in leaves. A stack of books sit in front of her on a wrought iron table, where she has her feet propped. She talks on a house phone.
C: CAIRO
D: Hi. You have my phone.
C: JONATHAN
D: And whose phone do I have?
C: CAIRO
D: Cairo Sweet’s.
C: JONATHAN
D: Cairo. It’s Jonath-, Mr. Miller.
C: CAIRO
D: Sticky Fingers Miller.
C: JONATHAN
D: How are you?
C: CAIRO
D: Tethered to a landline. Are you already gone?
C: JONATHAN
D: I should be.
N: Beatrice enters to pour herself another drink.
C: BEATRICE
D: I don’t give a flying backwards fuck, Amy. Give them the first draft, they’ll think it’s new.
N: Jon waves at Bea to get her attention.
C: JONATHAN
D: I need to drop something off at a student’s house.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 61.
C: BEATRICE
D: Great. Take care of it.
N: Beatrice pours four fingers of bourbon neat.
C: BEATRICE
D: It’s not enough, Amy.
E: CONT'D to Amy
N: A dark, shining beetle crawls across Cairo’s foot.
C: BEATRICE
D: Can you grab me some tampons, please? The organic ones if you can find them. Not you, Amy, obviously. Get me a better deal and you can plug my pussy.
E: CONT'D to Amy
N: The beetle makes its way up Cairo’s leg.
C: JONATHAN
D: You big-time, road-head owe me.
N: Cairo looks up. Silver maples above her are turning their leaves up to the promising rain.
C: JONATHAN
D: Sorry, honey. You still there?
E: CONT'D
C: CAIRO
D: Still here.
C: JONATHAN
D: You live over in Lovell Hills, right?
C: CAIRO
D: How did you remember that?
C: JONATHAN
D: Eidetic, remember?
C: CAIRO
D: Show-off.
C: JONATHAN
D: And Mensa.
C: CAIRO
D: Shut up.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 62.
C: JONATHAN
D: My mom is really proud.
N: Jonathan watches Beatrice down her entire glass of bourbon in one go.
C: JONATHAN
D: What’s your address? I’ll come drop it off before we leave, if that’s okay.
E: CONT'D
N: The wind picks up. Cairo’s long hair moves around her like a curtain.
S: EXT. LOVELL HILLS - AFTERNOON
N: LOVER YOU SHOULD HAVE COME OVER by JEFF BUCKLEY Thick dark clouds hang low over the horizon. We pass massive estates on rolling acres. The houses are separated by thick groves of oak and magnolia.
C: CAIRO
D: 400 Huxley. Might be hard to see for the trees, but it’s there.
E: V.O.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’ll see you soon.
E: V.O.
C: CAIRO
D: Hurry. It’s gonna rain.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
N: Cairo walks toward us down a dark, vast hallway of windows.
S: EXT. LOVELL HILLS - AFTERNOON
N: Jonathan drives toward us, one arm out the window. The reflection of the storm on the windshield obscures our view of him.
S: EXT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - THE TERRACE - AFTERNOON
N: Thunder rolls. Rain drops smack against the books on the table. On top, is APOSTROPHES AND AMPERSANDS. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 63.
S: INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - LOWER GALLERY - AFTERNOON
N: We follow Cairo past enormous original Egon Schiele paintings. Her face is luminous. Not smiling exactly, but bright.
S: INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - STAIRWELL - AFTERNOON
N: Her fingers trail up the bannister. Her bare feet pad on the steps. Up and up she goes, past hallways of countless rooms.
S: INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
N: We follow her into her bedroom, then into her bathroom.
S: INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - BATHROOM
N: Smooth walls into soaring ceilings. Clawfoot bathtub. Cathedral windows. She looks at herself in the mirror. Rain shadows streak down her face. She puts a little perfume behind her ears. Finger brushes through her hair.
S: EXT. CAIRO’S DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON
N: Jonathan’s car moves through the overgrown trees. As he comes upon it, we see Cairo’s house in full.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S CAR - AFTERNOON
N: Jonathan sits in the driveway, idling his car. He turns Cairo’s phone over in his hand. He looks up at her house. The view is blurred by rain. Her ghost stands at a second story window. Then it moves away. He opens the car door.
S: INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - PORCH - AFTERNOON
N: Cairo opens the front door. The house is dark and vast behind her. Jonathan stands in the rain. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 64. A long moment passes between them - the curtain of rain the only thing separating them.
C: CAIRO
D: Come here.
N: Jonathan makes a decision.
C: JONATHAN
D: No. You come here.
N: Without hesitation, Cairo steps off the porch into the rain. BLACK.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT
N: Beatrice types at lightning speed on her laptop. She is surrounded by paper. A bourbon rocks sweats in a glass next to her. Jonathan is across from her, also on his laptop. CU on the screen - a blank word document with a blinking cursor. He stares at it. His beautiful hands hover above the keys. FLASH TO:
S: EXT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - EARLIER THAT AFTERNOON
N: Slow motion rain waterfalls off the second story porch. Behind the water - a white form, a ghost.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jonathan looks up. Beatrice is staring daggers into him.
C: JONATHAN
D: What?
C: BEATRICE
D: What are you doing?
C: JONATHAN
D: I’m working.
C: BEATRICE
D: On what?
C: JONATHAN
D: I don’t know yet.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 65. Beatrice pinches her nose between her fingers.
C: BEATRICE
D: Baby...I know we were supposed to have this weekend together and I’m sorry that my team is the fucking tasteless worst and I promise to fire them the moment this gets to press, but I can’t work like this.
C: JONATHAN
D: Like what?
C: BEATRICE
D: I can’t work with you sitting there across from me sucking all the inspiration out of the room. I can feel you trying to conjure it from the air and it’s fucking my flow.
N: He blinks at her.
C: JONATHAN
D: Are you serious?
C: BEATRICE
D: Please go away.
E: dead serious
N: He shuts his computer and gets up.
C: BEATRICE
D: Thank you. I’ll be nicer when it’s over.
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: I’ll be outside.
C: BEATRICE
D: You gonna cut down that kudzu before it eats our home?
C: JONATHAN
D: I think it’s pretty.
N: She looks at him a moment before returning to her laptop. He leaves.
S: EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: Jonathan walks across the yard. A curtain of kudzu has grown across the door to his shed. He maneuvers under it to get inside. He doesn’t close the door behind him. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 66.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S OFFICE/SHED - NIGHT
N: Jonathan sits at his desk, pulls down a bottle of bourbon and pours himself a tall glass. Wet night sounds whisper through the open door. He looks at the blank document on his laptop. He closes his eyes. FLASH TO:
S: EXT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - EALIER
N: The rain slows and the ghost is revealed. Cairo looks different in his memory - still and shining, a penny wish in a fountain.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S OFFICE/SHED - NIGHT
N: He opens his eyes. Leaves crowd the window, hundreds of little peeping toms. A single vine has broken through the rotted wood of the sill. He reaches out a hand to touch it - thinks better of it, and pulls his hand away. He leans back in his chair. FLASH TO:
S: EXT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - EARLIER
N: Jonathan looks at Cairo. She looks amused. She looks at his mouth.
C: CAIRO
D: Come here.
N: The sound of rain turns to white noise.
C: JONATHAN
D: No. You come here.
N: We see them in profile. A suspended moment of her in the dry space and him in the wet. Then she crosses that barrier. She moves into the rain. Her hands reach for his face. Her lips press to his mouth. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 67. He gives, just a little. Just enough. She slides her tongue inside him. He closes his eyes. She doesn’t.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S OFFICE/SHED - NIGHT
N: DING. A chime pulls Jonathan from the memory. NEW MAIL. He reduces the document. His email is behind it - amid various promotions is a new message from SALTYSWEET@GMAIL.COM. He smiles. The subject title: FOR JONATHAN, LOVE CAIRO He opens it.
S: EXT. JONATHAN’S OFFICE/SHED - NIGHT
N: Gold light within illuminates the little room, turning it bottle glass green against the vines. A jewel box in the overgrown yard. It begins to rain. BLACK.
S: EXT. THE WOODS - THE FOLLOWING MONDAY - MORNING
N: ADAGIO FOR STRINGS AND ORGAN IN G MINOR - RESPIGHI (SUITE III/ BOCCHERINI: QUINTETTINO) Cairo looks like Jonathan’s dream version of her, only all in black. Her hair is done. She wears makeup. She walks alone through the misty woods. A pink dawn glows above her. We follow her through the trees to the back of the school...
S: EXT. BENSON AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING
N: Cairo breaks through the tree line. We follow her to the school, into... Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 68.
S: INT. JONATHAN MILLER’S CLASSROOM - MORNING
N: ...Jonathan’s room. It’s empty and dark. The clock ticks. She goes around the room turning on the lamps and then over to the window to watch the sun rise through the trees. Eventually, Jonathan enters and freezes. They stare at one another in the reflection of the window a moment before she turns to him, smiling.
C: CAIRO
D: Good morning.
N: He walks to his desk and sits without saying hello. He pulls a stack of papers from his bag. She watches him but says nothing. He’s got his hand on her short story.
C: CAIRO
D: Are you okay?
E: CONT'D
N: He starts to say something. Stops. Reconsiders.
C: CAIRO
D: What’s wrong?
E: CONT'D
N: He looks like he’s bracing for impact.
C: JONATHAN
D: Your story.
C: CAIRO
D: Oh. You didn’t like it?
C: JONATHAN
D: You need to choose another author.
C: CAIRO
D: Why?
C: JONATHAN
D: This is inappropriate.
N: She repeats the word back to him as though she’s never heard it.
C: CAIRO
D: Inappropriate. What do you mean?
C: JONATHAN
D: Why did you write this?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 69.
C: CAIRO
D: You asked me to.
C: JONATHAN
D: Why did you choose this content?
C: CAIRO
D: You said to write what you know.
C: JONATHAN
D: This is what you know?
C: CAIRO
D: This is. Us.
N: Beat.
C: JONATHAN
D: No Cairo, this is you. I can’t...understand it.
N: She stares at him a moment.
C: CAIRO
D: It’s about two like-people abnegating social convention. It’s a comment on the sexual anesthetization of a culture super- saturated with pornography. It’s about the inefficacy of said culture’s romantic dogmas on young people’s expectations. It’s about inexorable attraction. It’s layered.
C: JONATHAN
D: You deliberately misinterpreted the assignment.
C: CAIRO
D: I was clear about how I intended to write it.
C: JONATHAN
D: This is pornography.
C: CAIRO
D: Yes.
C: JONATHAN
D: So then put it in your diary and not on my fucking desk.
E: beat MORE
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 70.
C: JONATHAN
D: Write a new story with a new author. I won’t indulge this.
E: CONT'D
C: CAIRO
D: The story or us?
C: JONATHAN
D: Both.
N: His mouth is sticky.
C: CAIRO
D: But you already have. You inspired it.
C: JONATHAN
D: I can’t accept it.
C: CAIRO
D: Can’t or won’t? Because it sounds like you’re scared. And it looks like you’re measuring. Stop talking to me like a stranger and say what you mean.
C: JONATHAN
D: What did you expect me to do with this?
C: CAIRO
D: Read it. Grade it.
C: JONATHAN
D: You can’t be serious.
C: CAIRO
D: I assure you I am.
C: JONATHAN
D: Rewrite it.
C: CAIRO
D: Why?
C: JONATHAN
D: You know why.
C: CAIRO
D: Tell me. Say it.
C: JONATHAN
D: If you don’t rewrite this, I’ll have to fail you for the midterm.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 71.
C: CAIRO
D: Tell me why.
C: JONATHAN
D: I don’t have to tell you anything.
C: CAIRO
D: You’re afraid, aren’t you? It made you feel something that scared you.
C: JONATHAN
D: Don’t put words in my mouth.
C: CAIRO
D: Then say them yourself. Tell me what it made you feel.
C: JONATHAN
D: Incredibly foolish for having trusted this material to a child.
C: CAIRO
D: A child. And what was I before you read it?
C: JONATHAN
D: My student.
C: CAIRO
D: You’re lying.
C: JONATHAN
D: We’re done here.
C: CAIRO
D: Did it get too real for you? You built the world, you built the fantasy but it wasn’t on the page it was in real life and now that it has flesh you can’t bear the weight of it.
C: JONATHAN
D: This conversation is over.
C: CAIRO
D: You can’t blur the lines and expect me to see a boundary when I suddenly cross it.
N: Beat. They stare at each other. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 72.
C: JONATHAN
D: Let me be very, very clear with you; You are my student and I am your teacher and that is all. Any misconceptions of that are, regrettably, something you shoulder alone.
N: Cairo’s face shifts backwards on her skull.
C: CAIRO
D: Write what you know, is what you said.
C: JONATHAN
D: I know what I said.
C: CAIRO
D: You don’t know anything you say. This is good. You know it is. So let’s examine the real issue, which is not my writing, but yours.
E: beat. Then, slowly
C: JONATHAN
D: Excuse me?
C: CAIRO
D: You thought you were gonna be hot shit, didn’t you? You thought you were gonna be somebody, didn’t you? “Overreaching without ambition.” Do you know what that means? It means you weren’t brave enough to be better. It means you’re deliberately impotent. It means you are mediocre. You wanna fail me?
C: I fucking dare you.
D: But you better make it mean something to you and you better know what it means because the cost is high, Mr. Miller. And if you’re not very, very careful...this banality, this falsity you wallow in will devour you until you are as small as you pretend to be. And then you will disappear and no one will give any more thought to you than they do an unread cookie fortune.
N: She moves toward him. A viper. His pupils dilate. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 73.
C: CAIRO
D: How disappointing you must be to those who believed you’d be more. No wonder you’re a public school teacher.
E: CONT'D venomous
N: She leaves. He watches her go. He is still. So still as to be inanimate. Then he stands and turns to the chalkboard. He raises the chalk, makes a short stroke - then presses his forehead to the board. Anguish shatters his face. His arm drops and the chalk streaks against it like the trail of a falling star.
S: EXT. BENSON HIGH SCHOOL - OUTSIDE - MORNING
N: Sleepy students are starting to arrive. Cairo walks through an outside corridor, into the parking lot and out into the field behind the school, where she disappears back into the choked trees.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT EVENING
N: Jonathan enters, exhausted. Beatrice is cross-legged on the couch, all of her electronics lit up in a corona around her. She wears pair high waisted knickers and a tee shirt. A sweating glass of bourbon rests between her legs. She looks up at him and smiles, buzzed. He sets his bag down and slumps in a chair next to the couch. A large window is behind him.
C: BEATRICE
D: How you doing over there, Professor?
C: JONATHAN
D: I’ve had a very bad day.
C: BEATRICE
D: You want a drink?
N: She hands him her bourbon. He drinks it in one go.
C: BEATRICE
D: They make you plough a field or something?
E: CONT'D
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 74.
C: JONATHAN
D: I had a very unpleasant conversation with a student about the midterm assignment.
C: BEATRICE
D: Juicy. More info.
C: JONATHAN
D: Don’t make fun of me.
C: BEATRICE
D: I’m not. I’ve been a cave troll for weeks - I long for experiences of the outside world. Tell me. Oh. Was it with her? Your acolyte?
E: off his look beat teasing
N: He looks at her. She can see he’s torn up about it.
C: BEATRICE
D: What happened?
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: She drafted something that makes Henry Miller look like Dr. Seuss.
C: BEATRICE
D: You let a teenager run with Miller and you’re surprised it was vulgar?
C: JONATHAN
D: She was supposed to use his literary technique not his subject matter.
C: BEATRICE
D: Go on.
N: She unfolds her legs and moves closer to him. Her cheeks are liquor flushed. She engages fully.
C: BEATRICE
D: What’s the subject matter?
E: CONT'D
N: He’s reluctant. She’s expectant. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 75.
C: JONATHAN
D: An English teacher and a student who have an illicit affair, complete with pre-cum and cherry popping. Those words exactly.
C: BEATRICE
D: Show me right now.
N: Jonathan considers her - skeptical of her interest and starving for her attention. She crawls over the couch and onto his lap, surprising him.
C: BEATRICE
D: I wanna know what shocked you.
E: CONT'D
N: He reaches into his bag and retrieves the story. Hands it to her. She reads it right there in his lap, in his face.
C: BEATRICE
D: For Jonathan, Love Cairo. Oh baby, it’s a love letter.
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: It’s pornography.
C: BEATRICE
D: Shh. No disclaimers.
N: She settles herself into his lap. Jonathan looks over his wife as she reads. Her breasts beneath her shirt. The way her eyes shimmer over the words. His hands rest on her thighs. She moves forward on him, in approval. She smiles. Then she laughs. She’s enthralled. The quoted text appears on the screen as she recites.
C: BEATRICE
D: “Alice sat back against the soft down of her pillows, her sex split and sore, and imagined herself as a pitted peach, with bruised and open flesh. The sanguine testament of her virginity lay heavy like an oil slick in the cream lace of her Tuesdays.”
E: CONT'D
N: Beatrice looks at him like this is the cleverest punchline she’s ever heard. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 76.
C: BEATRICE
D: Her Tuesdays. Like her Tuesday panties.
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: Yes.
N: She whistles.
C: BEATRICE
D: She’s got it bad.
N: She sets down the pages, looks into his eyes.
C: BEATRICE
D: Tell me what else happens.
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: You can read it right there.
C: BEATRICE
D: No. You tell me. Because I know you remember it word for word and I want you to do the thing. Tell me how she describes you.
N: She moves against him again. Encouraging him. His hands slide over her skin. She looks down at him through heavy lids as he speaks.
C: JONATHAN
D: ”Mr. Murphy, tall and carelessly attractive, kept his thoughts to himself and his blue eyes at half- mast. One might assume his drowsy appearance to be symptom of a vague institutional ennui, but Alice saw it mostly to hide the shock of indecency he felt when he lay his eyes on the young unripened bodies of his female students.
E: reciting from memory
N: Beatrice slowly presses herself into him until he is practically saying the words into her mouth.
C: JONATHAN
D: He licked his chapped lips, imagining his tongue instead sliding into the cleft between each of their legs. Imagining himself as the first. As the standard.
E: CONT'D MORE
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 77.
C: JONATHAN
D: None were exempt from his salacious reveries. All cunts were created equal and magnificent in his mind.”
E: CONT'D
C: BEATRICE
D: Are they?
N: She grinds against him.
C: BEATRICE
D: Or are some cunts remarkable?
E: CONT'D
N: He resists her. Torturing himself.
C: JONATHAN
D: Stop.
E: half-hearted
N: She doesn’t. She intensifies. He’s losing focus.
C: JONATHAN
D: You’re drunk.
E: CONT'D
C: BEATRICE
D: I’m indecent.
N: He pulls her tight against him. They grind into one another. They breathe together. He slips his hand inside her panties and she sucks in a breath of air. Through the window behind Jonathan, a pair of headlights illuminate the yard. She gasps again and cums against his fingers - she arches back and issues a hearty laughs. She kisses him. Reaches a hand to his cock and gives it a squeeze. Then she leans into his ear.
C: BEATRICE
D: We’ve got company.
E: CONT'D
N: He looks at her with anguish. The front door bangs open.
C: BORIS
D: Y’all shouldn’t leave the damn door unlocked.
E: O.C.
N: Beatrice dismounts her husband and grins at him before walking into the foyer, just as she is. Shameless.
C: BEATRICE
D: What up, player?
E: O.C. warm, to Boris
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 78. Jonathan teeters on the edge of too many feelings.
S: INT. CAIRO’S BEDROOM - THAT EVENING
N: Cairo and Winnie sit on Cairo’s bed, passing back and forth an expensive bottle of vodka.
C: WINNIE
D: What, so he was offended?
C: CAIRO
D: He was affected.
C: WINNIE
D: You still into him?
C: CAIRO
D: NO. Are you kidding? He’s a pretender. At least with Boris what you see is what you get. Jonathan Miller is like fucking imitation crab meat in gas station sushi.
C: WINNIE
D: Savage.
C: CAIRO
D: You fuck Fillmore yet?
C: WINNIE
D: You know I’d tell you.
C: CAIRO
D: If I knew I wouldn’t be asking.
C: WINNIE
D: You know when I’m in my luteal phase. I tell you everything.
C: CAIRO
D: Distract me.
C: WINNIE
D: What would the lady have?
E: down
C: CAIRO
D: Bloodsport. Text Boris. Say you’re drunk texting him - that way he’ll imagine you drunk and what you might be doing drunkenly.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 79.
C: WINNIE
D: For real?
N: She is. Winnie starts to draft a text to B_FILL.
C: CAIRO
D: Ask him what he’s up to.
N: Winnie types the text and sends it.
C: WINNIE
D: What do you think he’s doing?
C: CAIRO
D: Masturbating.
N: DING. B_FILL: I was just thinking about you.
C: CAIRO
D: Ask him what he’s thinking about you.
E: CONT'D
N: She does.
C: WINNIE
D: Do you think he likes me?
C: CAIRO
D: Do you want to be liked or fucked because those things are different for girls who look like you.
C: WINNIE
D: I want both.
C: CAIRO
D: You’re better than him.
C: WINNIE
D: I like him.
C: CAIRO
D: Well beggars can’t be fucking choosers, can they?
N: DING. B_FILL: What are you doing?
C: CAIRO
D: Tell him you’re with me and we’re doing what all girls do alone at night.
E: CONT'D
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 80. She types. DING. B_FILL: And what might that be?
C: CAIRO
D: Tell him we’re measuring the depths of our sexuality within the safe confines of BFF-dom.
E: CONT'D
N: Winnie types.
C: WINNIE
D: Sick. You should just seduce admissions. You got mad skill, son.
N: DING. B_FILL: What does that entail? They share a look.
C: CAIRO
D: Take off your shirt.
N: Cairo hops off the bed and walks to her wardrobe.
C: WINNIE
D: What are we gonna do?
C: CAIRO
D: We’re gonna make out. For them. Not for you.
C: WINNIE
D: It can be a little for me.
N: Cairo undresses in front of Winnie. She puts on a lace bra and takes her hair down.
C: CAIRO
D: How’s this?
C: WINNIE
D: Yeah. Good.
N: Cairo gets back on the bed and faces Winnie.
C: CAIRO
D: Well?
N: Winnie pulls off her shirt. Cairo scans her - making her feel self-conscious and aroused all together. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 81.
C: CAIRO
D: Give me your phone. Sit on your knees and face me. Closer.
E: CONT'D
N: Winnie bends at the waist.
C: CAIRO
D: What are you, a dutch clock? Come get right up on me.
E: CONT'D
N: Winnie does, leaning in to the moment. Their bellies touch. Cairo sets the phone to face them, framing them in the shot.
C: CAIRO
D: Ready?
E: CONT'D
N: They kiss. Soft at first, then more urgent. Cairo snaps the picture and a flash bleaches them in white light. The kiss doesn’t end with the flash. Winnie’s hands are on Cairo’s back, in her hair. Cairo bites Winnie’s lip. Hard enough to force her to pull away. They stare at one another a moment. Cairo hands Winnie the phone.
C: CAIRO
D: Send it.
E: CONT'D
C: WINNIE
D: What do I say?
C: CAIRO
D: Nothing. Just send it.
N: She does. FLASH TO: Earlier that day: Cairo walks through students like a ghost, making her way to her locker.
C: WINNIE
D: Are you gonna text Jonathan?
C: CAIRO
D: No.
C: WINNIE
D: You have his number don’t you?
N: FLASH TO: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 82. She grabs her things, among them an UNLABELED MANILA FOLDER, into which she stuffs a copy of her essay.
C: CAIRO
D: All warfare is based on deception. Move your enemy but don’t be moved by him.
E: V.O.
N: FLASH TO: Cairo drops the essay into an INBOX outside the door of JOYCE MANNER, ASST. PRINCIPAL’S office. Winnie stares at Cairo.
C: CAIRO
D: Any tool is a weapon if you hold it right.
C: WINNIE
D: How do you just come up with this shit?
C: CAIRO
D: Do you listen to anything I give you?
C: WINNIE
D: Only the compliments.
C: CAIRO
D: It’s Ani DiFranco. Do yourself a favor and have a listen through the canon. And have a cig with me.
C: WINNIE
D: Okay. No. Okay. No. I’m just going to lay right down here and die.
N: Cairo digs through Winnie’s bag and pulls out the Muffin Men logo.
C: CAIRO
D: I’m gonna draw this on you.
C: WINNIE
D: What?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 83.
C: CAIRO
D: The logo. On your tits.
N: Winnie grins at her.
C: WINNIE
D: Do it, you nasty bitch.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME NIGHT
N: Beatrice and Boris sit in the kitchen. Cartons of fried food and several beer bottles are spread over the table. Beatrice and Boris are drunk-ish. They laugh.
C: BEATRICE
D: ...and anyway, I’m almost finished. Gonna fire the lot of them once it gets to publishing.
C: BORIS
D: Did you come up with a title?
C: BEATRICE
D: Yeah, but they hate it. Said it sounded like a sad love song. I told them it is.
C: BORIS
D: What’s it called?
C: BEATRICE
D: Lesser Expectations of a Greater Love.
N: The phone rings. Beatrice gets up to answer it. Boris texts on his phone.
C: BEATRICE
D: Hello? This is his wife, who’s this? Uh huh, just a second.
E: CONT'D on the phone
S: INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Jonathan stares at himself in the mirror. He looks sick. FLASH TO: Jon’s POV. Cairo sits on the desk across from him, laughing at something he’s said. Beatrice pops her head in. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 84.
C: BEATRICE
D: Jon?
N: He watches her mouth move.
C: BEATRICE
D: It’s ah, Joyce? Want me to tell her you’ll call her back from prison?
E: CONT'D covering the receiver, drunk
N: She guffaws. He focuses on her tongue behind her teeth.
C: BEATRICE
D: Too soon?
E: CONT'D
N: He snaps to.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’ll take it.
N: He takes the phone and Beatrice leaves. He takes a breath.
C: JONATHAN
D: Hey Joyce, what’s up?
E: CONT'D on the phone
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Beatrice sits on the couch with Boris, who finishes his text and puts his phone back in his pocket.
C: BEATRICE
D: Who is she?
C: BORIS
D: Not telling.
C: BEATRICE
D: Becky? Tara? Tiffany. A stripper, naturally.
C: BORIS
D: Why are you so mean?
C: BEATRICE
D: Can I help it if every girl you’ve ever dated owns a pair of five inch lucite heels and is named after a character from the Babysitter’s
C: Club? No I can’t.
D: Your life, your choices.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 85.
C: BORIS
D: You’re a snob. Kristy was great.
C: BEATRICE
D: She had one leg.
C: BORIS
D: Shoulda seen the way that nub could work a pole.
C: BEATRICE
D: That’ll do, Pig.
C: BORIS
D: Pigs have thirty minute orgasms. Alright baby girl, I gotta run.
E: he downs his beer
C: BEATRICE
D: Don’t go.
C: BORIS
D: I’ve got forty-five pop-quizzes on thermodynamics to grade. Or fail. We haven’t even reached fractals - fucking hopeless youth of America. Tell Jon I had to run?
C: BEATRICE
D: You got it.
C: BORIS
D: Thanks kiddo. I’ll see ya.
N: He leans down to kiss her and she turns her head so he kisses her mouth. It’s a millisecond too long.
C: BEATRICE
D: Gotcha.
N: Beat.
C: BORIS
D: I gotta go.
C: BEATRICE
D: So go.
N: He looks at her a moment longer and then leaves. Jonathan enters, visibly shaken. Beatrice swivels her head at him.
C: JONATHAN
D: Joyce got the story.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 86.
C: BEATRICE
D: What?
C: JONATHAN
D: Well, it had “For Jonathan from Cairo” written at the top, so you know, no mistaking. She’d like to speak with me formally to go through the necessary paperwork.
C: BEATRICE
D: Paperwork for what?
C: JONATHAN
D: An incident report. I think she did it.
C: BEATRICE
D: Think who did what?
C: JONATHAN
D: Cairo. Cairo turned it in.
C: BEATRICE
D: It’s a short story, Jon. Not a communist manifesto.
C: JONATHAN
D: It’s the implication - if she convinces them that something happened between us, I could lose my job.
C: BEATRICE
D: That’s not all you could lose. Did something happen between you?
C: JONATHAN
D: Nothing I invited.
N: She stands. Sways a little.
C: BEATRICE
D: Teenage girls are dangerous, Jonathan. I hope you know what you’re doing.
N: She walks past him into the kitchen. He stares at nothing.
S: INT. BENSON CITY REC CLUB - OUTSIDE - FOLLOWING MORNING
N: Various people in work out gear run around a track surrounded by metal bleachers. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 87. Jonathan, also in running gear, sits alone watching the runners and smoking. He’s hungover. Boris enters the track and jogs over to him with a spring in his step.
C: BORIS
D: Sorry for bailing last night. You know how I feel about shitting in other people’s homes.
C: JONATHAN
D: What’s with all the sunshine? You’re effervescent.
N: Boris pulls out his cellphone.
C: BORIS
D: You won’t believe me if I tell you, so I’m just gonna show you. Don’t be judge-y.
C: JONATHAN
D: Oh God. Okay. Show me.
N: He shows Jonathan a picture on his phone.
C: BORIS
D: Take a look at that, my brother.
C: JONATHAN
D: Woah. Woah. Who’s that?
C: BORIS
D: You don’t recognize them?
C: JONATHAN Should I? Damn.
D: Is that...is that the Muffin Men logo?
E: Boris flips the picture
C: BORIS
D: On perfectly pert perky tatas, painted to look like muffins. It’s genius.
C: JONATHAN
D: Where do you find these girls?
N: Boris swipes to another picture, this one of Cairo and Winnie kissing. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 88.
C: BORIS
D: That’s the beauty and the brain, brother. Being beautiful and not so smart.
N: Jonathan launches the phone back at Boris.
C: JONATHAN
D: Boris - You have to delete that.
E: horrified
C: BORIS
D: Like hell I do.
C: JONATHAN
D: Neither of those girls are eighteen. That’s child pornography.
C: BORIS
D: Two girls making out in what could easily be bathing suits is not child pornography, it’s a beautiful statement about equal rights.
C: JONATHAN
D: You don’t think this is deliberate? They’re fucking with you man, can’t you see that?
C: BORIS
D: Calm down. I can like it enough for both of us.
C: JONATHAN
D: Does this idiocy come naturally to you or is it an active effort?
C: BORIS
D: Mostly natural. What’s your damage?
C: JONATHAN
D: Cairo turned in her midterm and...I mean, I’ve read some prurient stuff before but she wrote some shameless, Marquis De Sade shit for me, man. Like a love letter. Like, she told me she did.
E: MORE
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 89.
C: JONATHAN
D: And in a classic character foible reserved for schmucks like me, I mishandled her feelings and she admitted the goddamn thing to administration and I know how this will sound, but I think she did it to punish me because I didn’t ...because - I don’t know. And now I have to meet with Joyce because it was fucking dedicated to me and I have to explain why and what it means.
E: CONT'D
C: BORIS
D: You couldn’t have known what she was going to write.
C: JONATHAN
D: I approved Henry Miller as her author. I gave her the assignment early. She said it was inspired by me and her. Fuck, this is so bad.
C: BORIS
D: Was it?
C: JONATHAN
D: Was it what?
C: BORIS
D: Inspired by the two of you.
C: JONATHAN
D: You can’t be serious.
C: BORIS
D: Look, I know you’ve been marooned on the Island of Sexless Toys and then along comes this attractive, intelligent girl who thinks you invented the Oxford comma, who worships you...you give her your time, your attention, your effort - I mean, you like her. I wouldn’t blame you if you had a little thing.
C: JONATHAN
D: You think I could have a little thing? She’s only seventeen.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 90.
C: BORIS
D: Not that different from eighteen.
E: shrugging
C: JONATHAN
D: Yes the hell it is. One is legal and one is not.
C: BORIS
D: Don’t tell me you haven’t thought about it.
N: FLASH TO: Cairo’s lips wrap around a cigarette. She laughs with it between her teeth.
C: JONATHAN
D: I haven’t.
C: BORIS
D: You’re a fucking liar.
C: JONATHAN
D: What do you want me to say? That I think she’s ideal - that I fantasize about being with her?
C: BORIS
D: Do you?
C: JONATHAN
D: What difference does it make?
C: BORIS
D: It’s not exactly a mystery how you both have been feeling.
N: FLASH TO: Cairo and Jonathan talk with Boris in the morning.
C: JONATHAN
D: Come on.
C: BORIS
D: She’s special to you. You don’t have to be ashamed of it.
N: FLASH TO: Cairo and Jonathan on the porch at Mollie Fonatine’s. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 91.
C: JONATHAN
D: It was never my intention to blur the line.
C: BORIS
D: Yeah but did you have any intention to clarify it?
C: JONATHAN
D: But clarify what, exactly? We got on. We enjoy each other’s company. I’m her teacher, she’s my student. How could it be any clearer?
C: BORIS
D: Oh, I don’t know...maybe without the special treatment, the socializing, the preemptive assignments, the clear favoritism... I just think you have to examine your own actions before you accuse a kid of going after you.
N: FLASH TO: Cairo smiles. What once was sweet is now sinister.
C: JONATHAN
D: The story is fetishistic. It’s filth. The fact that she has that kind of stuff rolling around in her brain is unsettling at best. The idea that she wrote it about us, that she told me she did, is beyond perception.
C: BORIS
D: I think it turns you on.
N: FLASH TO: Cairo brings a cigarette to her lips.
C: BORIS
D: That’s why you’re so riled and why you can’t stop obsessing over it.
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: Quit telling me what the fuck you think I think.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 92.
C: BORIS
D: You want me to lie to you? You know I’m right.
C: JONATHAN
D: This isn’t about how I feel it’s about what she implies - you realize people get crucified for shit like this while people like you are looking at naked pictures of your students.
C: BORIS
D: Oh, I’m shaking in my boots. You know what your problem is? You’re just not fucking cool enough to be honest with yourself about anything that doesn’t fit your narrative. So what? You wanted to fuck her. Maybe you even loved her. You didn’t need to humiliate her to capture the moral high ground. It’s not a war.
N: FLASH TO: Jonathan leans over Cairo’s desk to look over something she’s written. Their faces are close.
C: JONATHAN
D: No, it’s a witch hunt.
C: BORIS
D: You’re the adult. Take some responsibility.
C: JONATHAN
D: Fuck you.
C: BORIS
D: Cool, Jon.
N: Boris leaves Jonathan sitting on the bleachers.
S: INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - LIBRARY - MORNING - SAME DAY
N: Morning light cuts into a vast and dark library through partially drawn velvet curtains on floor to ceiling windows. Shapes are hard to make out in the dimness of the room. Everything is still. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 93. Then, we see her. And only because she moves to light a cigarette. Cairo sits in the shadow of the window, looking out. Smoke billows above her.
S: INT. JONATHAN MILLER’S CLASSROOM - MORNING
N: Jonathan sits at his desk, head in his hand as he grades with the other. The classroom is full, save for one desk in the front. Cairo’s. The class is watching GOOD MORNING, MISS DOVE. The bell rings and everyone leaves but Winnie. He looks up at her briefly, then back down at his papers.
C: WINNIE
D: Have you seen Cairo?
C: JONATHAN
D: I haven’t.
C: WINNIE
D: I’m surprised she hasn’t come by.
N: Jonathan’s pen hesitates, only a moment.
C: WINNIE
D: I haven’t seen her in a few days. I thought maybe...you had.
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: I haven’t.
C: WINNIE
D: You don’t text or anything?
N: He looks at her.
C: JONATHAN
D: Did she tell you we do?
N: Beat.
C: WINNIE
D: Well, you know, Cairo’s good at saying everything and nothing.
N: He’s at a loss. So is she.
C: WINNIE I don’t understand what’s
D: happening.
E: CONT'D
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 94. His eyes flash with gentle accusation.
C: JONATHAN
D: Don’t you, Winnie?
N: They both look at one another. Desperation separates and unifies them.
S: INT. JOYCE MANNER’S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY
N: JOYCE MANNER, 40s, Assistant Principal at Benson High School, sits behind her desk. Her educational diplomas from Northwestern and a framed photo of her, her wife, and two teenage daughters hangs on the wall. INTERCUT between JONATHAN and JOYCE and CAIRO and JOYCE - two separate conversations that feel like one.
C: JOYCE
D: How did it start, in your own words?
C: CAIRO
D: It was sort of like we recognized each other.
C: JONATHAN
D: She’s exceptionally talented. Singular in that, at this school.
C: JOYCE
D: Did you exhibit favoritism? Give special mentor-ship?
C: JONATHAN
D: Of course.
C: CAIRO
D: He was excited to give me the midterm assignment in advance.
C: JOYCE
D: And the mid-term is what percentage of the final grade?
C: JONATHAN
D: Twenty-five percent.
C: CAIRO
D: Enough to destroy my GPA and ruin my shot at Stanford.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 95.
C: JOYCE
D: You do know that Henry Miller is not an approved author for public school studies, right?
C: JONATHAN
D: She’s better than the curriculum, Joyce. You know that. I wanted to help her stand out.
C: CAIRO
D: I think he was impressed that I knew who he was. Have you read his work?
C: JOYCE
D: How often did you see one another beyond classroom time?
C: CAIRO
D: Before school, and in class, of course. Sometimes after.
C: JOYCE
D: What would you do?
C: CAIRO
D: Talk about literature, things we care about. Sometimes we’d share a cigarette.
C: JONATHAN
D: We just happened to be in the same place, smoking a cigarette. That’s how it started, I guess. Not that there’s anything - I mean that’s how we started smoking together.
C: JOYCE
D: Do you see each other socially?
C: CAIRO
D: We went to a poetry reading together.
C: JONATHAN
D: Absolutely not.
C: JOYCE
D: Would you have considered yourselves friends?
C: CAIRO
D: Without question.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 96.
C: JONATHAN
D: I think we are as close as would be appropriate for a student and a teacher.
C: JOYCE
D: Have you ever seen each other alone outside of school?
C: CAIRO
D: Only the one time.
C: JONATHAN
D: Yes. Sort of. I mistakenly picked up her phone on my way out of class and I went to return it right away before my wife and I left for a business trip in Nashville.
C: CAIRO
D: He came to my house.
C: JOYCE
D: Were you alone?
C: JONATHAN
D: Yes.
C: CAIRO
D: My parents were out of town.
C: JOYCE
D: And what happened?
C: JONATHAN
D: Did she tell you something happened?
C: CAIRO
D: Nothing that didn’t seem okay at the time...
C: JONATHAN
D: I returned her phone.
C: JOYCE
D: Did you go in the house?
C: CAIRO
D: He told me to come outside to him.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 97.
C: JONATHAN
D: I was brief.
C: CAIRO
D: Mr. Miller always took the time to validate me.
C: JOYCE
D: And what happened when you went outside?
C: CAIRO
D: We kissed.
C: JONATHAN
D: I didn’t touch her. And when she sent me the story, I told her it wasn’t appropriate for school. Listen, I think this is a teenage crush that took a hard leap sideways...I feel like there’s nothing I can say to defend my position.
E: beat
C: JOYCE
D: Because there isn’t.
N: Cairo leaves Joyce’s office. She’s not smiling. Not exactly.
S: INT. LOCAL RESTAURANT - EVENING
N: Jonathan walks into Winnie’s restaurant. Boris is already seated at the bar. Jonathan sits down next to him.
C: JONATHAN
D: Hey.
C: BORIS
D: You want a drink?
C: JONATHAN
D: Yes.
C: BORIS
D: I thought you might.
N: Boris passes him a draught of beer. Jonathan takes a long pull of it.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’ve been suspended.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 98. Boris holds up four fingers to the bartender.
C: BORIS
D: On what grounds?
C: JONATHAN
D: Hers.
N: The bartender sets down two doubles. Boris looks at Jonathan.
C: BORIS
D: Did you love her?
N: Jonathan’s face crumples. Boris squeezes his hand and lets Jonathan feel everything he’s feeling.
C: BORIS
D: To the grave, man.
E: CONT'D
N: Jonathan does his best to collect himself.
C: BORIS
D: What can I do?
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: Don’t leave me.
C: BORIS
D: You’re my best friend, Jon. I won’t leave you.
C: JONATHAN
D: Everything is falling. It didn’t have to be this way.
E: beat
C: BORIS
D: Maybe it did.
N: Jonathan looks at him with bleary eyes. He’s tired. Lost.
C: BORIS
D: You fall in love with things that diminish you because...I dunno, maybe you don’t think you deserve more. But you’re not a ladder, man. And you’ve made yourself into one. So...maybe make yourself into something else.
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: Like what?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 99.
C: BORIS
D: Something that can’t be climbed or crushed.
N: Jonathan tips the glass to his mouth and swallows the liquor in one go.
C: JONATHAN
D: My wife is gonna put me in the ground.
C: BORIS
D: Beatrice is a reptile. Take the lashing and let it go.
C: JONATHAN
D: This will hurt.
C: BORIS
D: Like the goddamn devil.
N: Jonathan moves to pull out his wallet.
C: BORIS
D: It’s on me.
E: CONT'D
N: Jonathan stands. Boris gets up and hugs him, tight.
C: BORIS
D: Go with God, Jon. I’ll still be here.
E: CONT'D
N: Jonathan leaves. Boris sits back down at the bar. Winnie comes over.
C: BORIS
D: Hey, sweetheart. Where you been?
E: CONT'D
C: WINNIE
D: I didn’t want to bother you.
C: BORIS
D: You okay?
C: WINNIE
D: I’m...I dunno. How’s Mr. Miller?
C: BORIS
D: Fucked six ways to Sunday. How’s Cairo?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 100.
C: WINNIE
D: She dumped me.
E: heartbroken
N: Not giving a damn who sees, he puts his hand on her face.
C: BORIS
D: Natural disasters are bound to occur, baby. You’re gonna be alright.
N: She looks at him. True tenderness exists between them. He drops his hand.
C: WINNIE
D: I gotta get back.
C: BORIS
D: I’ll see you.
N: She leaves. He takes a slow drink.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Jonathan leans against the sink. Beatrice stands in the doorway. She’s drunk. He’s drowning.
C: BEATRICE
D: Did you fuck her?
C: JONATHAN
D: No.
C: BEATRICE
D: What happened?
C: JONATHAN
D: I don’t know.
C: BEATRICE
D: You were there, weren’t you?
N: Beat.
C: JONATHAN
D: She impressed me and I gave her preference. She turned in this story, which I obviously couldn’t accept - her feelings were hurt and she lashed out. That’s how I understand it.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 101.
C: BEATRICE
D: You flirted with her and then you rejected her.
C: JONATHAN
D: It wasn’t flirting.
C: BEATRICE
D: What was it, then?
C: JONATHAN
D: Affection.
C: BEATRICE
D: Are you attracted to her?
N: He can’t answer her.
C: BEATRICE
D: I’ll tell you, then. This is about a girl who flattered you, who read your little book and your inevitable surrender to adulation. You fucking fell for it. Finally, finally someone gave your reductive little short stories a second glance and you can’t help but get hard for it because you suddenly feel worth something?
E: CONT'D
C: JONATHAN
D: Yes, she made me feel worth something. What does that tell you?
N: She sways into the room and walks right up to him, pressing her hips into his. She puts a hand on his face as though she might kiss him.
C: BEATRICE
D: Did her sycophancy get you hard or was it the smell of teen spirit?
C: JONATHAN
D: Fuck you.
C: BEATRICE
D: Be my guest.
N: She tilts her head up to him - their mouths almost touch. Then she smiles. It’s awful. He jerks away from her.
C: JONATHAN
D: Stop.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 102.
C: BEATRICE
D: Why should I? Did you?
C: JONATHAN
D: I didn’t fuck her.
C: BEATRICE
D: Then I guess you should try not to look so guilty.
C: JONATHAN
D: I didn’t do anything wrong.
C: BEATRICE
D: Didn’t you?
N: He looks around at his kitchen. At his beautiful, cold wife.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’m in a futility myth.
C: BEATRICE
D: How romantic.
C: JONATHAN
D: Why are you so punishing?
N: A ragged, raging annoyance washes over her face.
C: BEATRICE
D: You wanted her. I can read it all over you.
C: JONATHAN
D: How can you read anything in this state, you fucking alcoholic. Jesus Christ.
C: BEATRICE
D: It’s the only thing that makes you bearable.
N: She cuts him deep. He sucks in a sword of air through his teeth.
C: JONATHAN
D: You’re a monster.
C: BEATRICE
D: And you’re a liar. You’re the banner boy of mediocrity, waving your flag of spotless virtue like some kind of middling American Hero.
E: MORE
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 103.
C: BEATRICE
D: But Jon...you’re the villain. And you can’t even see it, can you? God, you are insufferably pedestrian. You abused your power. You manufactured all of this with your refusal to accept your fucking privilege.
E: CONT'D
N: They stare each other down. Truly looking into one another’s eyes for the first time in longer than either can remember.
C: JONATHAN
D: I love you.
C: BEATRICE
D: What?
C: JONATHAN
D: I don’t understand how you can say such things to me when I love you.
C: BEATRICE
D: You think that exempts you from the truth?
C: JONATHAN
D: From cruelty.
N: She laughs.
C: BEATRICE
D: Honesty isn’t cruelty, you fragile fuck.
N: She walks right past him and pours a drink. To the brim. She takes a long, slow gulp. He watches her.
C: JONATHAN
D: Don’t you worry for me at all?
E: anguished
C: BEATRICE
D: What would I possibly worry about other than dying of boredom having to listen to your inventions of conflict?
N: Beat.
C: JONATHAN
D: You are vile.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 104.
C: BEATRICE
D: But you’ve always known that, haven’t you? Why don’t you write about it?
E: beat
N: She saunters out of the bloodbath, leaving him alone and entirely defeated.
S: EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: Jonathan walks out of the house and faces the shed. The kudzu almost reaches the ground and covers most of the windows. Jonathan stares at it a moment, then, with his bare hands, begins to rip the vines away. They are tough and tear his skin. He cries and sweats and bleeds until it is all down. Then he goes inside and shuts the door.
S: INT. CAIRO’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT EVENING
N: Cairo is sitting on her bed, leaning against the headboard, hand writing on a legal pad in red ink. She smokes and ashes into a coke can. Winnie enters without knocking. Cairo pays her no attention. Winnie stands there - mirroring them in a happier time. She’s upset, nervous.
C: CAIRO
D: Spit it out, Winnie.
E: not looking up
C: WINNIE
D: What are you doing?
C: CAIRO
D: Completing my Stanford admissions essay.
C: WINNIE
D: Is that all?
C: CAIRO
D: I’m smoking a cigarette too, if you wish to be very literal.
C: WINNIE
D: Why are you avoiding me?
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 105.
C: CAIRO
D: Because I don’t want to talk to you.
N: This hurts. Winnie is in uncharted waters.
C: WINNIE
D: Cairo.
C: CAIRO
D: What?
E: savage
C: WINNIE
D: ...What are you doing to Mr. Miller?
N: Cairo sets her notebook down and gives Winnie her full, withering attention.
C: CAIRO
D: I’m testifying against him.
C: WINNIE
D: Why?
C: CAIRO
D: He underestimated me. I overestimated him.
N: Winnie softens. Unsure what to believe.
C: WINNIE
D: Are you okay?
C: CAIRO
D: Of course. I’m inspired.
C: WINNIE
D: That’s not funny.
C: CAIRO
D: It is, a little.
C: WINNIE
D: Please don’t do this.
C: CAIRO
D: Why?
C: WINNIE
D: People go to hell for things like this.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 106.
C: CAIRO
D: No, Winnie. They go to Stanford.
N: They stare at one another. It takes Winnie a second, but she connects the dots.
C: WINNIE
D: You created this.
E: reeling
C: CAIRO
D: No. I capitalized on it.
C: WINNIE
D: For what? To punish him because he didn’t want to fuck you?
C: CAIRO
D: He wanted to fuck me, Winnie.
N: Cairo lights another cigarette.
C: WINNIE
D: I’ll testify against you.
C: CAIRO
D: No you won’t.
C: WINNIE
D: Excuse me?
C: CAIRO
D: I’ll show them what evidence I have against you and Boris and not only will your credibility be shot to shit, but you’ll incriminate him as well. Two teachers can lose their jobs. Oh hey...we could double team.
C: WINNIE
D: This isn’t what I meant.
C: CAIRO
D: Isn’t it? Haven’t I played it out exactly like you imagined?
C: WINNIE
D: I was joking -
E: weakly
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 107.
C: CAIRO
D: You weren’t joking. You just didn’t expect me to be better than you.
C: WINNIE
D: Why are you doing this?
C: CAIRO
D: Because he didn’t stop me. Because this is chess.
C: WINNIE
D: It’s not a game.
C: CAIRO
D: You’re right. It’s adversity, and I will overcome it.
N: She turns back to her legal pad. She is in profile against the headboard. We pull back to reveal the wall behind her - Jonathan, sitting at his desk in his shed. They lean against each other in different spaces and times.
S: INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NASHVILLE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
N: Close in on Jonathan reading Cairo’s short story. We look up at him from the computer and watch the text project onto his face and in the air around him.
C: JONATHAN
D: Mr. Murphy drove with the resignation of the already dead. He imagined he felt the way Dylan Thomas did heading into the White Horse to take the drink that would kill him. He knew what they were and what they were not.
E: V.O.
N: Slow close on the blue of his eye - in the reflection of his pupil we see the story playing out - the slow drizzle of rain and a dark haired girl standing at an open window. Closer and closer until we’re there...
S: INT. CAIRO’S BEDROOM - SHORT STORY - FANTASY
N: The dark haired girl looks out the window. Behind her, the room glows faintly with the soft diffused gray light of a rainy afternoon. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 108. The window is open and fat rain drops smack against the sill. We hear a car pull into the driveway. Rain splashes her hand. Her cell phone rings and she answers. Bold text appears on the screen, with a blinking cursor.
C: CAIRO
D: “Hello”, she said.
C: JONATHAN
D: I’m here.
E: V.O.
C: CAIRO
D: Alice thought immediately of a slaughtering lamb, though she couldn’t be certain which of them was meant for sacrifice.
E: V.O.
N: Close on a water droplet landing on the white windowsill into...
S: INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
N: A drop of water from the running bath has landed on the page Jonathan is reading. He wipes at it and the ink runs. His face is unreadable.
C: CAIRO
D: He was outside. He was inside.
E: V.O.
N: Jonathan blinks.
S: INT. CAIRO’S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - SHORT STORY/FANTASY
N: When his eyes open, he stands before her in her bedroom. The text floats over what we see, a reenactment of the story. She puts a cigarette to her lips.
C: CAIRO
D: You want one?
N: The flame and Cairo are reflected in Jonathan’s pupils.
C: CAIRO
D: Smoke drifted from her mouth with practiced, cinematic effort.
E: V.O.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 109.
C: JONATHAN
D: It excites you, doesn’t it? The surreptitiousness of it all.
C: CAIRO
D: Is it more romantic for you that way?
N: He smiles.
C: CAIRO
D: Mr. Murphy smiled wide, the lines around his mouth deepening into parentheses that framed his perfect lips into a punch line.
E: V.O.
N: Jonathan’s face fills the frame, looking right at us.
C: JONATHAN
D: This is no romance. I’m sorry to disappoint you.
N: He snatches her wrist and the cigarette falls to the floor, spewing ash and spark from its tip before being crushed with her shoe.
S: INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
N: Jonathan’s eyes scan the page. He shifts on the floor.
C: CAIRO
D: Alice opened her mouth to say something, but the words fell away. Mr. Murphy loomed over her, his Cadillac-blue eyes hungry and bored.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CAIRO’S BEDROOM - SHORT STORY - FANTASY
N: CU on Jonathan as the dialogue spells itself out of his mouth.
C: JONATHAN
D: In what peril you find yourself.
N: His face is close to Cairo’s. We don’t see their legs, but we see them shift.
C: CAIRO
D: He pressed the knee of his starched chinos into the space between her legs.
E: V.O.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 110.
C: JONATHAN
D: I want you to read to me.
C: CAIRO
D: Alice watched in slow motion as Mr. Murphy’s tongue undulated when he spoke - pink tide against the bone shore of his teeth.
E: V.O.
C: JONATHAN
D: Read it to me the way you read it to yourself.
C: CAIRO
D: Their bodies separated like a single cell splitting.
E: V.O.
N: ECU on Cairo’s sticky glossed lips separating in slow motion.
C: CAIRO
D: Alice took the tattered Henry Miller paperback off of the bedside table and spread it open on the comforter of her bed.
E: V.O.
N: CU on a large framed print of Virginia Woolf - the last portrait taken of her, smoking a cigarette. In the reflection of the glass, we watch Cairo lean over the book and bed. Jonathan stands behind her.
C: JONATHAN
D: Page thirteen he said, behind her. One hand slid up the front of Alice’s short cotton dress, as the other pointed to a sentence on the page.
E: V.O.
N: A slender finger points to the page. Another moves up her leg.
C: JONATHAN
D: Begin here.
C: CAIRO
D: It’s not because she’s a child, it’s because she’s a child with no innocence.
E: reading
S: INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
N: Jonathan slips his hand into his pajama pants. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 111.
S: INT. CAIRO’S BEDROOM - SHORT STORY - FANTASY
N: A spider crawls across a window sill.
C: JONATHAN
D: He was against her then and Alice felt a push of muscular wetness between her legs. Mr. Murphy placed his slender hand over hers and guided her to the mound at her center, pressing her fingers into the dark fold there—
E: V.O.
N: Fingers move over white fabric.
C: CAIRO
D: -just behind the damp fabric of her panties, feeling her feel herself.
E: V.O.
C: JONATHAN
D: He found his way around the elastic at her leg and slid two deft fingers into the warm darkness of her virgin cunt.
E: V.O.
N: We watch what they describe.
C: JONATHAN
D: Keep reading.
N: CU on Cairo’s mouth as she reads. CU on Jonathan’s mouth as he listens.
C: CAIRO
D: Look into her eyes and you see the monster of knowledge, the shadow of wisdom—
E: reciting
C: JONATHAN
D: She felt him shift, his weight suddenly very low. He kissed her ass through her dress, pressed his face to it.
E: V.O.
C: CAIRO
D: -the roundness and shapelessness of childhood have scarcely left her body. She is a woman in miniature, a copy as yet incomplete.
E: reciting
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 112. INTERCUT between the hotel bathroom and Cairo’s short story. Images of the real Cairo, Jonathan, Beatrice, Boris and Winnie begin to blend with what he sees. Jonathan’s hand is on her bare thigh. Cairo’s hands resting between her legs under her desk.
C: JONATHAN
D: A thousand years of violence and conquering boiled within him as he held the mouth of her pubis like a hooked fish - a thing gasping for release, for mercy, for death.
E: V.O.
N: Close on the back of Cairo’s neck and Jonathan’s open mouth against it.
C: CAIRO
D: Alice stopped reading.
E: V.O.
N: Cairo’s hands grip the comforter. CU on a half-eaten muffin. An ant picks away pieces of it.
C: JONATHAN
D: Her gullet tightened as he went deeper within — searching for the answer to a question he’d doubted—
E: V.O.
C: CAIRO
D: -but there it was—
E: V.O.
N: Jonathan is masturbating in the bathroom.
C: JONATHAN
D: -the answer and the question separated by that thin fleshy veil— the cicatrix that will never heal-
E: V.O.
N: Blots of dark red ink drop onto a thick white page. Winnie, wearing no make up, uses a fine watercolor paintbrush to thin out the ink in a long slender stroke.
C: CAIRO
D: -the serpent’s apple.
E: V.O.
N: The spider crawls onto the bed.
C: JONATHAN
D: He would renounce everything he believed in for a taste of her. He would abandon all of his burdens—
E: V.O.
N: Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 113. Beatrice sucks a raw oyster out of its shell.
C: CAIRO
D: The impassive, harpy wife, the marginalization-
E: V.O.
N: CU on Beatrice’s hands as she uses Apostrophes & Ampersands as a coaster for her bourbon.
C: JONATHAN
D: The ethics, the abstemiousness—
E: V.O.
N: Cairo watches Jonathan with his back to us, standing at a blackboard. She sits at her desk and scratches a raw mosquito bite on her ankle with her other foot.
C: CAIRO
D: All surrendered and sacrificed to the seduction of subjugation.
E: V.O.
N: Cairo’s earring is tangled in her hair. Jonathan masturbates in the shower while Beatrice brushes her teeth at the sink.
C: JONATHAN
D: He peeled the wet cotton down her legs and pressed into her from behind, the width of his face forcing her legs apart at their seam. Her cul was slick against his chin—
E: V.O.
N: Jonathan presses Cairo’s bare shoulders onto the bed, his fingers splayed wide over her blades as her hair fans out above her. The muscles in her back shiver as he moves against her.
C: CAIRO
D: Just as he imagined it was when she was alone, maybe in her bedroom—
E: V.O.
N: The spider crawls across Cairo’s pillow. Boris and Winnie pass in the hall. Neither looks at the other.
C: JONATHAN
D: Maybe in a bathroom stall at school, her own fingers knuckle deep - trying to rub out that itch-
E: V.O.
N: A pair of shoes under a bathroom stall, panties stretched around the ankles. Salmon (mm/dd/yyyy) 114.
C: CAIRO/JONATHAN
D: The ache inside.
E: V.O.
N: Jonathan’s face against Cairo’s. Wide shot of the hotel room. Jonathan with his back to us against the frosted glass bathroom door. Beatrice sits in bed, typing. Separate worlds.
C: JONATHAN
D: He saw himself burying his cock in her, brutally fucking away the exigency that swelled her clit and choked her better judgements. He would fill her up with cum.
E: V.O.
N: CU on Cairo’s eye. Reflected in it is the spider, crawling across the sheets.
S: INT. JONATHAN’S OFFICE/SHED - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
N: Jonathan cums. He sits there a moment, the computer bright before him. He closes his eyes. THE LIGHTS IN THE SHED ARE SUDDENLY BRIGHT AND AUSTERE. He opens his eyes to...
S: EXT. COURTHOUSE - MORNING
N: Jon sits alone on a bench outside. He lights a cigarette. Cairo walks toward him, her parents and Joyce in tow. She wears a skirt, sweater and keds, and looks terribly young. She waves to him. A slow, sad smile spreads across her face. Checkmate. Slow rise upward. Above the characters. Above the courthouse. Above the trees. Kudzu chokes everything. CAN’T NOBODY LOVE YOU by SOLOMON BURKE END.
