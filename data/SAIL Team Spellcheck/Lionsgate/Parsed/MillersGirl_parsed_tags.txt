N: CAIRO SWEET, 17 and plain in a dark hooded sweatshirt, sits
N: alone at a table in a large kitchen. It’s dark - the only
N: lights coming from her computer screen, a dim bulb above a
N: massive chef’s stove, and an expensive television hanging on
N: the wall, playing NOW, VOYAGER on mute.

N: She shuts the laptop and stares at the TV a moment. Grainy      *
N: black and white flickers cast shadows across her impassive      *
N: face. Behind her, the sun is just starting to rise gray-pink    *
N: in a winter sky.

0: 
N: Winnie is on her phone by the door, keeping a watchful eye on
N: the scene. Cairo enters the room. Jonathan packs his bag and

C:                     JONATHAN

D:           You in a hurry?
0: 
C:                     JONATHAN
D:           Headed on a little weekend vacation
D:           with my wife.

D:           What do writers do on vacation?
0: 
C:                     JONATHAN
D:           Pretend to write in a different
D:           location, I guess.
0: 
N: Winnie’s in the door. It’s a dance for them to be alone
N: together.
0: 
C:                     CAIRO
D:           Can we talk about the midterm?
0: 
C:                     JONATHAN

D:           Henry Miller.
0: 
C:                     JONATHAN
D:           Provocative.
0: 
C:                     CAIRO
D:           I can justify him.
0: 
C:                     JONATHAN
D:           His structure is challenging to
D:           emulate.
0: 
C:                     CAIRO
D:           It’s not just structural though,
D:           it’s everything - his decadence,
D:           his total disregard for literary
D:           etiquette, his destruction of
D:           convention. You know. The good
D:           stuff.
0: 
N: He raises an eyebrow at her.

0: 
C:                       JONATHAN
D:           Miller is   public enemy no. 1 to the
D:           censors -   he’s top of the list we
D:           discussed   at the start of the
D:           semester.   He’s controversial.
0: 
C:                     CAIRO
D:           Yeah, and I’m applying to Stanford.
D:           If it’s not controversial, it’s not
D:           interesting.
0: 
C:                       JONATHAN
D:           Okay.

D:           I trust you.
0: 
N: A moment of suspension passes between them - Cairo smiles and

C:                     WINNIE
D:           Oh Mr. Miller...I just love the
D:           decadence and the words and
D:           breaking all the rules.
0: 
N: She throws herself on the desk like a naughty school girl.
N: Boris comes to the door but they don’t see him.
0: 
C:                     CAIRO
D:           I didn’t say it like that.
0:
