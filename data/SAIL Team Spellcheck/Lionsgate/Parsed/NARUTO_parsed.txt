M: PICTURE UP ON:
S: EXT. HOKAGE SQUARE - DAY
N: A row of SCHOOLCHILDREN, wearing the school uniforms of an unfamiliar world, almost like tunics. Half the kids raise their hands at the teacher’s question. Their TEACHER is young, hardly 20, and a great storyteller.
C: TEACHER
D: Yui? Who told you the story?
C: YUI
D: My mom.
E: extreme little kid voice
C: TEACHER
D: And what kind of story is it? A happy story or a sad story?
C: YUI
D: Ummmmmm.... a sad story.
C: TEACHER
D: That’s right. It’s a very sad story. But sometimes it’s important to tell sad stories, you know why?
N: The kids blink back at her. One kid picks his nose.
C: TEACHER
D: So we never forget the people in them. Are you ready?
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. EDGES OF KONOHA - FLASHBACK
C: TEACHER
D: Seventeen years ago, on this very day, a greedy, angry man named Orochimaru unleashed the Nine- Tailed Fox to terrorize Konoha...
N: In a single frozen moment, decades ago, there stands a MAN. A man with piercing, intelligent eyes. OROCHIMARU. The man is performing deft, intricate hand gestures. In slow motion his hands make momentous sound, like crashing waves. Towering above him, a FOX MADE OF PURE FIRE RAVAGES THE CITY. The giant fox walks straight through Orochimaru, who smiles as if quenched by its flames, unharmed. It walks straight through Orochimaru... and tosses buildings together like toys. People scream and run.
S: EXT. HOKAGE SQUARE - DAY
C: TEACHER
D: Now, who protects us from people like Orochimaru? Does anyone know?
C: ASSORTED KIDS
D: The Shinobi.
C: TEACHER
D: That’s right, the Shinobi.
C: NARUTO
D: Orochimaru used to be a Shinobi but then he unfortunately turned evil.
N: The teacher’s gaze swish-pans to find NARUTO UZUMAKI, a 17- year old street kid, standing in her row of students.
C: YUI
D: Really?
C: NARUTO
D: Believe it.
C: TEACHER
D: Aren’t you a little old for this class?
N: She’s mostly amused, not annoyed. The kids giggle.
C: NARUTO
D: Na, I just love this story.
C: TEACHER
D: The Shinobi rose up to defend the city...
S: EXT. STREETS OF KONOHA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: A soaring lineup: THE SHINOBI, each with a distinct ability: A slender one who commands a wave of spinning blades, A stout one with a giant fist that grows on command, One who ripples the earth with his breath, A warrior in his 40s who fights empty-handed with iron gauntlets up to his elbows, A one-eyed finesse killer with a kusari-fundo, a diabolical chain weapon that slices the air when he spins it, And at their helm, MINATO NAMIKAZI. A still-young leader with blond hair and straight posture, a true and genuine soldier of light. Minato lets out a whoop like a bird cry. When the fox swivels to face him, he performs three intricate hand gestures. DAGGERS OF LIGHT emanate from Minato, piercing the fox in the eye, the blades of light slicing the fox’s flaming fur. The fox obliterates the building Minato stands on with a swipe of its paw, but Minato leaps away, fast as lightning.
C: TEACHER
D: They were led by Minato Namikaze, our city’s Fourth Hokage.
S: EXT. HOKAGE SQUARE - DAY
N: Now, we get a good look at the OPEN SQUARE the kids are standing in, with a view of HOKAGE ROCK. Four faces are carved into the cliffside of Hokage Rock, like presidents. The newest face, on the far right, is MINATO.
C: TEACHER
D: That’s him, see? Up there. He was the Hokage of all Konoha, so he had a special job to protect everyone.
C: YUI
D: He’s up there?
C: NARUTO
D: That’s just a statue. In real life he was a person.
E: stage whisper
S: EXT. SIDESTREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: Back to the past: SARUTOBI, the bare-knuckle fighter in gauntlets, corners Orochimaru on a sidestreet.
C: SARUTOBI
D: Orochimaru.
N: Orochimaru isn’t surprised to see Sarutobi. He makes a hand gesture and a pinwheel of wind slices the air. Sarutobi deflects with his gauntlet, and ATTACKS.
C: SARUTOBI
D: Orochimaru, what have you done?
E: CONT'D
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Why are you so afraid of power? The possibilities are right at our fingertips!
N: A WILD FLURRY OF BLOWS. Both are master fighters.
S: EXT. KONOHA SKYLINE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: The fox BAYS AT THE MOON, angrier than ever. It crumbles the city’s aqueduct with its forepaws.
C: MINATO
D: Fall back to the barricade! NOW!
S: EXT. STREETS OF KONOHA - NIGHT (TRACKING)(FLASHBACK)
N: The Shinobi retreat as the fox smashes buildings all around them, cutting them off from one another--
S: EXT. BEHIND THE BARRICADE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: Minato dives behind the barricade and looks out. His eyes go wide. He sees a BOY of no more than seven, barefoot, carrying a YOUNGER BOY of no more than two, racing away from the fox. Just as Minato sees the boys, the fox sees them too, sighting down a sidestreet, and starts towards them. It’s like a WAVE OF FIRE is flooding the street. Minato throws daggers of light as he runs to the boys-- It’s not enough, he’s not going to make it-- And just then, the fox FREEZES. Minato looks back to see KUSHINA (Minato’s age, red hair). Kushina’s red hair is unbound, stuck to her face with sweat. She wears a Shinobi headband and a flak jacket hastily thrown on over a nightgown. Her closed fists SHAKE with effort, like she’s holding invisible chains. Her HANDS are keeping the fox in place. Minato hurries the little boys to safety.
C: MINATO
D: Kushina! Go back inside!
C: KUSHINA
D: Don’t tell me what do to!
N: KAKASHI, the sly fighter with the kusari-fundo, arrives from above in a deft three-point landing. He sees Kushina’s hands, and the fox straining to move.
C: KAKASHI
D: Kushina! Are you okay?
C: KUSHINA
D: STOP ASKING ME IF I’M OK.
N: The fox strains. The invisible chains groan. Minato and Kushina realize: The bonds won’t hold. They look at each other. They know what they must do.
C: MINATO
D: The aqueduct collapsed, go help there!
E: to Kakashi
C: KAKASHI
D: I can fight it, Lord Hokage!
E: winding his weapon
C: MINATO
D: KAKASHI!
N: Minato’s sharp tone gets Kakashi’s attention, but then he says more gently:
C: MINATO
D: You’re good. But you’re not that good.
E: CONT'D
N: And Kakashi realizes: those are the last words he’ll ever hear Minato say. He bows and races off, following orders. And now, every step heavy with destiny, Minato comes to stand alongside Kushina. He looks up at the fox.
C: MINATO
D: Are you ready?
E: CONT'D to Kushina
C: KUSHINA
D: NO! YOU IDIOT. No.
N: When Kushina turns to face him, we see that she is CRYING.
C: KUSHINA
D: We were supposed to get old together.
E: CONT'D
C: MINATO
D: I am so sorry, my love.
N: And with that, Minato performs a precise series of hand gestures, his final act of faith. And THE ENERGY OF THE FOX SEEMS TO FLOW INTO MINATO. Kushina YELLS IN FURY as she holds the fox’s chains-- Minato grows brighter and brighter with the fox’s fire, filling the frame with flames and thunderous sound--
S: EXT. HOKAGE SQUARE - DAY
C: TEACHER
D: ...and they sacrificed their lives so that the city could be safe.
N: The kids stand wide-eyed, overloaded with emotion. Naruto also stands wide-eyed, just like a little kid. After a second he says, reverently:
C: NARUTO
D: So badass.
C: YUI
D: What does badass mean?
N: Okay--now the teacher’s getting a LITTLE BIT annoyed.
C: TEACHER
D: Don’t you have somewhere to be?
C: NARUTO
D: No Sensei, I’ve been tragically left behind by the system. So stay in school, little buddies. That’s right, high five.
N: Naruto gives high fives to the kids, then runs off into...
S: EXT. KONOHA MARKET DISTRICT - DAY
N: ...Konoha’s crowded MARKET DISTRICT. Stalls overflowing with bright fabric, tasty food, terrifying weapons. Overhead, hand-painted billboards, telephone poles and criss- crossing power wires create a mix of modern and mythical. The shoppers and sellers are diverse. People of all genders, predominantly East Asian, some black, white and brown. A crotchety vegetable seller barks at Naruto as he passes by.
C: VEGETABLE SELLER
D: Hey thief. Watcha stealing today?
C: NARUTO
D: A present for someone. And I’m NOT a thief. You should pay ME to eat your stinky vegetables.
N: With a fingertip, Naruto topples a pyramid of squash and runs.
C: VEGETABLE SELLER
D: ARGGH--Why would you-- My vegetables are not stinky!
E: gathering his squash
N: A laid-back old FRUIT SELLER looks up from her newspaper.
C: FRUIT SELLER
D: They’re a little stinky, friend.
C: VEGETABLE SELLER
D: Your FRUIT is stinky!
C: FRUIT SELLER
D: My fruit is DIVINE.
N: Naruto stops in his tracks. He heads for her fruit stand.
C: FRUIT SELLER
D: No no no stay away! You touch, you buy!
E: CONT'D shielding her fruit
S: EXT. FOUNTAIN - DAY
N: Naruto holds up a freshly-stolen EXOTIC FRUIT to catch the sunlight... a fruit that doesn’t exist on earth.
C: NARUTO
D: This is the PERFECT PRESENT.
E: in awe
N: Nearby, two HEIRESSES sit on the edge of a fountain, surrounded by paper-bound parcels from their day of shopping. One of them tries on a new haori (finely-stitched overcoat).
C: BORED HEIRESS
D: Father made me buy it. It’s so... practical.
N: The other heiress notices Naruto’s exotic fruit as he passes.
C: CURIOUS HEIRESS
D: Hey I’ve never seen one of those.
E: O.S.
C: BORED HEIRESS
D: Pssh! Don’t talk to him, he’s a vagrant.
C: NARUTO
D: I think it’s from the sand village.
E: approaching them
C: CURIOUS HEIRESS
D: Trade you for it. How about my sister’s new haori? She doesn’t want it.
N: Naruto unfolds the haori. He instantly forgets the fruit.
C: NARUTO
D: This is the PERFECT PRESENT.
E: in awe
C: PROSPEROUS MAN
D: You there! Get away from my daughters!
C: NARUTO
D: Aaaand that’s my cue. Thank you!
N: Naruto runs off with the haori.
S: EXT. BOOKSELLER’S STREET - DAY
N: A street just for booksellers, like the one by the Seine. Naruto tries to blend in, but the man’s voice follows him:
C: PROSPEROUS MAN
D: Stop him! Stop that thief!
E: O.S.
N: Two POLICE OFFICERS put down the books they were browsing. They’re both tall, athletic jocks, one male and one female, in uniforms like tactical samurai from the future.
C: FEMALE OFFICER
D: Stand for the law of Konoha!
N: Naruto calculates his odds--and breaks into a run.
C: MALE OFFICER
D: Stand! Stand for the law!
N: The Female Officer wings a BOLA at Naruto’s feet (a chained weapon used to trip up fleeing perps). He jumps just in time.
S: EXT. STREET WITH ROW OF TREES - DAY
N: Naruto shouts over his shoulder as he runs:
C: NARUTO
D: I’m not a thief! I traded something to get this!
C: FEMALE OFFICER
D: I arrested you last week!
C: NARUTO
D: Oh. Wait, that was you?
N: Now Naruto nimbly zig-zags through a row of trees. The officers race up either side of the row of trees-- But on one of his zig-zags, Naruto VANISHES.
C: MALE OFFICER
D: Where’d he go?
C: FEMALE OFFICER
D: Up there!
N: They spot Naruto PARKOURING ON BALCONIES.
S: EXT. BALCONIES - DAY
N: Naruto is shockingly agile at parkour, jumping between roofs and monkey-barring over balconies like it was nothing. He spots some kind of garden party on a huge outdoor terrace.
S: EXT. OUTDOOR TERRACE - DAY
N: Sudden quiet. A relaxed outdoor party for Konoha’s arty beatniks. They smoke strange cigarettes and watch as: A CALLIGRAPHER IN HER SEVENTIES paints calligraphy on a transparent silk screen stretched like a volleyball net. A MUSICIAN plays an ethereal electronic instrument, on the line between digital and analogue. And a PHOTOGRAPHER captures the performance with an elegant flashbulb camera. This scene will feel familiar to anyone who had the right kind of friends in the 1960s. Naruto skirts the edges of the outdoor terrace, comes to look over the photographer’s shoulder. The photos emerge from the camera and develop on the spot, colors blooming like watercolor.
C: NARUTO
D: You know, if you stand over here...
N: The photographer hands Naruto his camera. Naruto gives him the haori, to free up his hands.
C: NARUTO
D: ...you can get Hokage Tower in the shot.
E: CONT'D
N: Naruto clicks the shutter, and the photo emerges. The photographer takes the photo, impressed... Naruto hands over the camera in exchange for the photo...
C: NARUTO
D: Thanks!
E: CONT'D
N: ...and jumps the bannister, onto the next rooftop. It takes the photographer a second to realize he’s still holding the haori.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: Hey, wait!!
S: EXT. ALLEYWAY WITH RED DOOR - DAY
N: Smack, Naruto’s feet hit the ground in a narrow alleyway. He stares, entranced, at photograph in his hands.
C: NARUTO
D: This is the perfect present.
N: And he runs RIGHT SMACK into a very large man. The photo whips away on the wind, lost forever.
C: NARUTO
D: Hey! That was a gift!
E: CONT'D
N: The man wears a Shinobi headband loosely around his neck, but it’s been defaced. He is some kind of FALLEN NINJA.
C: FALLEN NINJA
D: You’re in the wrong part of town, leaping lizard.
N: Naruto looks: down the alleyway there’s a RED DOOR. A few women and men smoke outside the door, also in defaced Shinobi headbands. They gaze back with stony expressions. Naruto hears the footsteps of the approaching Female Officer. He says a silent prayer, and tells the Fallen Ninja:
C: NARUTO
D: Your breath smells like roadkill and your vest doesn’t go with those pants.
N: The Fallen throws him into a pile of trash and starts punching him, just as the Female Officer arrives. AND NOW: 1. The Officer drags the Fallen Ninja off of Naruto... 2. The Fallen Ninja wheels to face the Officer... 3. And Naruto is scot-free to make his escape. Naruto turns to go--but he can’t take his eyes off the fight. The Fallen Ninja makes precise hand gestures like the ones we’ve seen, only his look somehow VULGAR. IN SLOW MOTION: The GROUND CRACKS beneath the FEMALE OFFICER, but she jumps in time and fires her net gun at the Fallen. Naruto finally tears himself away, and scrambles onto...
S: EXT. INDUSTRIAL ALLEYWAY - DAY
N: Another industrial alleyway, where he is cornered by:
C: MALE OFFICER
D: Stand for the law of Konoha!
C: NARUTO
D: I didn’t DO anything!
C: MALE OFFICER
D: I arrested you last week!
C: NARUTO
D: I didn’t do anything TODAY.
N: The Male Officer shoots his net gun at Naruto. Naruto dodges, and runs STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE OFFICER. Halfway between them there’s a dumpster full of defective aluminum cans. Naruto overturns it, and scrambles to the top, into a second floor window.
S: INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY
N: It’s a FACTORY FLOOR. Big iron machines churn out identical cat-shaped cookies. Naruto bolts down the aisle, the Male Officer close behind. At the end of the aisle there’s a floor-to ceiling WINDOW that one of the workers has just, conveniently, opened. Naruto picks up speed.
C: NARUTO
D: I’ve always wanted to do this.
N: With a breath and a prayer, he JUMPS--
S: INT. ADJACENT WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: --across to the adjacent building, where he crashes through the window and stumbleskids to a stop. The Male Officer shouts from across the alleyway.
C: MALE OFFICER
D: Stand for the law!
N: Naruto JUMPS JUST IN TIME as the Male Officer wings his BOLA at Naruto’s feet. It misses, and winds around a column.
C: NARUTO
D: Hahahahaaa ya MISSED!
N: Frustrated, the officer runs off to find a different route. But now Naruto unwinds the bola from the column. It’s gorgeous, hand-wrought iron, engraved with Konoha’s seal.
C: NARUTO
D: Oh, wow. This is absolutely, without a doubt-
E: CONT'D
S: INT. RAMEN SHOP - NIGHT
C: NARUTO
D: --the PERFECT present for you, Iruka- san.
N: Gazing at the bola is IRUKA UMINO (30s), a serious young man with a scar across his nose and a formal style of speech.
C: IRUKA
D: Naruto, this is beautiful.
E: with great sincerity
N: Naruto smiles, and by God the boy is beautiful when he smiles.
C: IRUKA
D: And no, you cannot enroll in the Shinobi Academy.
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: Whhhhhat?? Who said anything about--
C: IRUKA
D: Naruto, I love you like my own son--
C: NARUTO
D: Oh come on, you’re not even that much older than me anymore!
C: IRUKA
D: --that is not how time works--
C: NARUTO
D: You know what I mean, we’re both MEN now.
C: IRUKA
D: --I love you like my own son but you have never gotten me a gift. Let alone one that was so... lovingly stolen.
C: NARUTO
D: Someone threw it at me actually, but whatever.
E: mumbling
C: IRUKA
D: I have something for you, too.
N: He nods to the shop owner, who comes over.
C: IRUKA
D: Naruto may order... anything.
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat
C: IRUKA
D: Happy birthday.
T: CUT TO:
N: Naruto is finishing his third ramen, empty bowls everywhere.
C: NARUTO
D: So, about the Academy.
C: IRUKA
D: Naruto, we’ve been through it. Ninja are born with something called chakra. Something they learn to harness, so they can do things like shoot fireballs and walk on water. Things you cannot do.
E: tensing up
C: NARUTO
D: They use JUTSU to walk on water. Here, like this:
N: Naruto imitates the hand gestures we’ve seen the Shinobi use. Iruka gently clasps his hands, stopping him.
C: IRUKA
D: Jutsu are just things you do with your hands. It is the ninja’s chakra that gives them their power.
N: Iruka touches his chest, as if that’s where chakra resides. Then he shakes it off, as if he’s said too much.
C: IRUKA
D: Besides, that place is pretentious. The faculty come into my shop sometimes. They have attitudes.
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: Because they’re heroes. Heroes get to have attitudes.
C: IRUKA
D: Please. I’m a hero. I work for a living. ...And you should too. You will be a good mechanic. If you would just listen to me every once in a while.
E: beat
C: NARUTO
D: You’re not even a good mechanic, dude.
C: IRUKA
D: I am not your dude. You need to cultivate a more respectful attitude towards your elders.
C: NARUTO
D: Well tell my elders to respect me!
C: IRUKA
D: --that is not how time works--
C: NARUTO
D: I’m serious! Everywhere I go it’s “don’t you have somewhere to be” and “stop, thief” and “get away from my daughters”--
C: IRUKA
D: WHAT did you say?
C: NARUTO
D: No, it’s-- A girl gave me a--
C: IRUKA
D: WHAT did a girl give you?
N: Naruto takes a deep breath and gets to the point:
C: NARUTO
D: I see how people look at me.
N: QUICK FLASHES OF: the faces in the marketplace--the police, the angry dad, the vegetable seller. Aggravated. Disdainful.
C: NARUTO
D: And I know I can be more. I just know it. I know it better
E: CONT'D
C: than I know anything.
D: I have to go to the Academy.
N: Iruka stops. Deeply moved by Naruto’s pain.
C: IRUKA
D: Oh, Naruto. You don’t need to be anything more than what you are...
C: NARUTO
D: That’s easy for you to say, you’re not the one who has to be it--
E: mumbling again
C: IRUKA
D: ...you just need to be a MECHANIC.
C: NARUTO
D: Uggggghhh Iruka-san!
C: IRUKA
D: Naruto, please. Your birthday is a happy day, but it is also a sad day. My entire family, our entire city, 17 years ago, wiped out.
C: NARUTO
D: But--
C: IRUKA
D: My entire. Family.
N: Naruto stops. He knows not to disrespect Iruka’s family.
C: NARUTO
D: Of course, Iruka-san.
S: EXT. RAMEN ICHIRAKU - LATER THAT NIGHT...
N: Naruto holds the door for his guardian.
C: NARUTO
D: It’s just that I’ve actually been training to be a ninja, is the thing.
C: IRUKA
D: I SAID ENOUGH.
N: And now, to prove himself, Naruto TAKES A SWING at Iruka. With lightning speed, Iruka blocks it. Another swing, another elegant block. Now 50 RAPID FIRE SWINGS AND BLOCKS. Finally, each man looks at the other, and asks in unison:
C: NARUTO IRUKA
D: Where’d you learn how to Where’d you learn how to fight? fight?
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: I told you! Some guys at the gym help me out. I even found some old books, and--
E: CONT'D
C: IRUKA
D: If you spent all that time in the shop you’d be very successful.
C: NARUTO
D: You’re hard on me.
C: IRUKA
D: You make it easy.
C: NARUTO
D: And wait, where’d YOU learn those moves?
N: Iruka takes the bola from his satchel, places it in Naruto’s hands, and closes them.
C: NARUTO
D: Wait--but it’s your present. I thought you liked it.
E: CONT'D wounded, vulnerable
C: IRUKA
D: You cannot go to the Academy. That is final.
N: With that, Iruka walks away. Naruto is left alone, cupping the bola in his hands.
S: INT. NARUTO & IRUKA’S HOME - NIGHT
N: A modest studio apartment in a low-rise apartment building. One shared room with two beds. Kitchen and bathroom right off of it. Split right down the middle: Naruto’s side is a complete mess and Iruka’s side is spotless. A tube TV plays a SOAPY DRAMA FEATURING A HANDSOME NINJA in the background... Iruka sleeps. Naruto stares at the ceiling, mind racing. With sudden impulsiveness, he leaps out of bed. BY THE DOOR Naruto pulls on his jacket. Thinks for a second. Grabs a scarf and wraps it around his face. His eyes land on a faded photo of YOUNG IRUKA AND HIS FAMILY. Next to that, a photo of Iruka and Naruto together. Naruto looks at the pictures. Looks over at Iruka, asleep. Then he takes a deep breath, and walks out.
S: EXT. ALLEYWAY WITH RED DOOR - NIGHT
N: Naruto creeps in shadow down the alleyway with the RED DOOR. FROM A DISTANCE: Fallen Ninja congregate. Spitting, sparring. Naruto looks up to the rooftops.
S: EXT. ROOFTOPS OVERLOOKING COURTYARD - NIGHT
N: Naruto’s on the roof, looking down into a rainy COURTYARD, the interior of the Fallen compound. RECRUITS stand at attention as KIDOMARU, a Fallen Ninja, paces in front of them. Naruto climbs down to listen in.
S: EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT
N: From ground level, Naruto can see that KIDOMARU HAS SIX ARMS.
C: KIDOMARU
D: Again! Pinhole, river, dragon.
N: The recruits attempt a jutsu on a practice dummy. The dummy hops a little, but nothing more.
C: KIDOMARU
D: What’s the matter, are you stupid? You sure look stupid.
E: CONT'D
N: Kidomaru’s breathing on the recruit’s cheek--VERY unsavory. He’s sloppier and drunker than any drill sergeant should be. Now Kidomaru whip-turns and does the jutsu himself-- And the WHOLE WORLD LURCHES with a stuttering, teeth-rattling buzz, like a wrench dropped in the machinery of the universe. It makes Naruto INSTANTLY PUKE. When he looks up, THE PRACTICE DUMMY is OFF-SET, its top section four inches off its bottom. An interruption in reality itself. You can imagine what that would do to a human. One of the recruits has a bloody nose and a few have thrown up, just like Naruto. Kidomaru laughs, dabs the nose blood.
C: KIDOMARU
D: That’s how you know you got it. AGAIN! Pinhole, river, dragon.
E: CONT'D
N: CLOSE ON: Kidomaru’s hands. The recruits’ hands, copying his, none of them quiet getting the hang of it. Naruto leans in for a closer look--and knocks a piece of scrap metal over. Instantly all eyes are on him.
C: KIDOMARU
D: Get him!!
E: CONT'D
N: Naruto races out the courtyard’s only exit--
S: INT. FALLEN WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
N: --taking him straight through the FALLEN WAREHOUSE. Fallen in facemasks operate giant assembly lines. What are they making here? Drugs? Explosives? Naruto runs outside--
S: EXT. ALLEYWAY WITH THE RED DOOR - NIGHT
N: --where he’s snatched up by the same Fallen from earlier.
C: FALLEN NINJA
D: I know you.
N: Kidomaru throws the door open, nearly snapping its hinges.
C: KIDOMARU
D: He was sneaking around the recruitment trials.
C: FALLEN NINJA
D: You gonna rat us out to the Shinobi?
C: NARUTO
D: It’s not like that, I promise-- I just want to learn from you!
N: Kidomaru smiles, and cracks ten of his thirty knuckles.
C: KIDOMARU
D: Oh I’m gonna teach you REAL good. Get his hands.
E: to the others
N: The Fallen mob Naruto, twist his arm, cover his mouth--
C: NARUTO
D: NO!
N: Slippery as an eel, Naruto twists loose, runs--
C: KIDOMARU
D: GET HIM!
N: Some of the younger Fallen follow the order, chasing him--
S: EXT. MIDNIGHT STREETS - NIGHT
N: --and as he runs, he desperately imitates the jutsu he saw in the courtyard, aiming over his shoulder at his pursuers.
C: NARUTO
D: Pinhole, river, dragon. Pinhole, river, dragon. Pinhole, river--
N: He arrives at a GRAFFITI MURAL illustrating the Nine-Tailed Fox attack, lit bright with klieg lights. And he happens to lock eyes with the illustration of Minato.
C: NARUTO
D: --dragon.
E: CONT'D
N: BWRG-K-K-K-K-K-K-K! This time when he does the jutsu, the world judders in that terrifying way--but TIMES A THOUSAND. Naruto’s KNOCKED off his feet. When he gets up, he sees that AN ENTIRE BUILDING HAS BEEN OFFSET, blocking the alleyway completely. Lights go on in the building. People come to the window. On the other side of the building, the Fallen STARE. Naruto has a moment to gape slack-jawed at the devastation-- Before he passes out cold.
S: INT. FALLEN WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Back at the warehouse, the Fallen crowd around the windows. The ones who chased Naruto re-enter.
C: FALLEN DOORKEEPER
D: What happened?
N: Before anyone can answer, the big red door audibly CLICKS. Someone tries the door. It’s locked.
C: FALLEN DOORKEEPER
D: Hey! Hey let us out! I don’t know what happened!
E: CONT'D banging the door turning to the rest
N: Over the doorkeeper’s shoulder, in the grain of the door, we can see THE OUTLINE OF A HUMAN FORM. Now, the body steps away from the door. It looks as though the door itself is moving. Until he’s far enough away that we see a signature blue bandana around this man’s face. And he transforms back into his true form, comes into focus. He was using Ninja Camouflage Technique. It’s KAKASHI, his Shinobi headband slanting over one eye. He’s toughened up since we last saw him. In rapid succession, Kakashi proceeds to DROP ALL THE NINJA WE JUST MET. He breaks someone’s leg, traps someone’s hands in a machine. Most are not dead. None are going anywhere. Kakashi scans the room. One left. It is Kidomaru. Who does that “come at me” hand movement, with all 6 of his hands. Kakashi LEAPS at Kidomaru, and they start SPARRING. They are evenly matched, and it is brutal. Kidomaru FLIPS KAKASHI OVER A TABLE, breaking the table in two-- But Kakashi wraps his ankle around one leg of the broken table, toes it into his hand, and swivels to a fighting stance, with broken table legs in either hand, like hatchets. Kidomaru reconsiders his odds of winning this fight.
C: KAKASHI
D: You’re gonna need more hands, bub.
N: Kidomaru throws a shuriken. Kakashi catches it--THWOCK--in table leg, and when he looks up, Kidomaru is gone. Kakashi runs to the window, peers outside... No sign of him. But there’s commotion and shouting a few blocks away.
S: EXT. IN FRONT OF GRAFFITI MURAL - NIGHT
N: From black. Naruto’s on the ground. His eyes open. Down the block, the Konoha Fire department is on site, helping citizens out of the destroyed building. No one has noticed the teenager collapsed in the shadows. Except Kakashi. Kakashi’s face slides into Naruto’s POV:
C: NARUTO
D: Hello, sir. You seem upset.
N: And with that, Naruto passes out again. Kakashi stands over the boy, troubled. Looks at the building. AND NOW, HE NOTICES A SIGIL ON NARUTO’S BELLY. A whorl around his bellybutton, glowing through his clothes. Kakashi sets his jaw. He hoists Naruto over his shoulder.
S: EXT. ROOFTOPS OF KONOHA - NIGHT
N: Even carrying Naruto, Kakashi easily sprints over rooftops, disappearing into the city as we tilt up to see the stars.
S: INT. NARUTO & IRUKA'S HOME - DAY
N: Naruto’s eyes open. He’s in bed, at home. He hears voices.
C: IRUKA KAKASHI
D: I accept your criticism--I You’ve forsaken your right to accept your criticism, but-- an opinion on the grounds of your ineptitude.
E: O.S. O.S.
C: NARUTO
D: Ir---Iruka-san?
E: groggy
N: Iruka comes in from the kitchen.
C: IRUKA
D: Thank the Spirits you’re okay. Naruto, this is Kakashi Hatake.
C: NARUTO
D: Oh. Hi. We already met. What happened?
N: Kakashi leans in the doorway, headband at its rakish angle. He has a heavy-lidded gaze and relaxed, almost bored manner.
C: KAKASHI
D: Nothing. You just used a forbidden jutsu and drained yourself of chakra.
E: shrugging
C: NARUTO
D: HAHA! Hah! See! See I have chakra!
E: at Iruka
C: IRUKA
D: SHH. You’re lucky you’re still alive. Using chakra like that is dangerous, drain it too fast and you die.
C: KAKASHI
D: I think you know what we need to do.
E: to Iruka
N: Kakashi walks away. Iruka looks grim. Naruto looks worried.
C: NARUTO
D: ...Wait, what do we need to do?
S: EXT. HOKAGE TOWER - DAY
N: The stunning, tree-lined approach to Hokage Tower, which soars into the sky. Shinobi sentinels flank the path. Naruto walks between Kakashi and Iruka, chastened and scared.
C: NARUTO
D: Do we really need to bother the literal Hokage himself about this?
E: stopping in his tracks
C: IRUKA
D: NARUTO. COME.
S: INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
N: Naruto sits between Kakashi and Iruka in the waiting room to the Hokage’s office. Civil servants in ceremonial uniform bustle in and out with stacks of paperwork. Then the door opens, and HOKAGE SARUTOBI steps out, now a powerful man in his sixties, ceremonial Omoni on his head. The men leap to their feet and bow.
C: IRUKA AND KAKASHI
D: Hokage.
N: Sarutobi bows appropriately, then looks Naruto up and down.
C: SARUTOBI
D: Naruto.
N: Iruka smacks Naruto. Naruto bows.
C: NARUTO
D: Hokage Sarutobi.
N: There’s a half-second pause, which Naruto seizes.
C: NARUTO
D: Well, we’re sure you’re very busy, so we’ll just go, and let you get back to running the city--
E: CONT'D
C: SARUTOBI
D: Stop.
N: Naruto freezes mid-sentence.
C: SARUTOBI
D: You two, enter.
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: So, like, I just...hang back?
N: The grown-ups enter Sarutobi’s office. They stand behind a big glass picture window. Naruto sneaks up to the window... But Sarutobi spots him. He performs a series of hand gestures
T: and we MATCH CUT TO:
S: EXT. IDYLLIC SITUATION - DAY
N: Naruto finds himself in a Zen garden on a perfect day.
C: NARUTO
D: ...What just happened?
S: INT. SARUTOBI’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: Iruka and Kakashi stand respectfully before Sarutobi.
C: SARUTOBI
D: Why is he here?
C: IRUKA KAKASHI
D: I can explain-- He learned a forbidden jutsu and knocked over a building.
N: Sarutobi looks to Iruka to confirm.
C: IRUKA
D: That... would seem to be true.
E: CONT'D
N: Sarutobi deflates. The weight of this news is great.
C: SARUTOBI
D: We’ve been lucky until now. If anyone finds out who Naruto really is, and what he really is... all the enemies of the past will come back to haunt us.
S: INT. OCCUPIED BAR - DAY
N: The six-armed Kidomaru limps into A BAR and slams the door. Sunlight filters through the shuttered windows of the bar. Kidomaru’s clutching a wound he got from Kakashi. Swoop back to reveal the bar’s PATRONS--thirty Fallen Ninja, drinking the day away. TAYUYA (auburn hair, 40s) shoots a BLOW-DART AT A RAT, killing it instantly. The bartender smiles weakly, afraid it’ll be him next time. This is not a good place.
S: INT. SARUTOBI’S OFFICE - DAY
N: The three men sit with this uncomfortable truth.
C: KAKASHI
D: What if we train him? Admit him to the Academy. Teach him to control what’s inside him.
C: IRUKA
D: He would love that, Lord, he’s been begging me--
C: SARUTOBI
D: Any demonstration of his power--let alone a magnification of that power- -carries enormous risk.
C: KAKASHI
D: I know. But... it’s what his parents would have wanted.
N: This argument affects Sarutobi deeply.
C: SARUTOBI
D: You know him best. Is he motivated?
E: to Iruka
C: IRUKA
D: Incredibly motivated.
C: SARUTOBI
D: And hard-working? Motivation backed by action?
C: IRUKA
D: Yes! He practices all the time.
C: SARUTOBI
D: What about focus. Impulse control. Patience.
N: Iruka freezes where he stands.
C: IRUKA
D: ...uhhhh........
C: KAKASHI
D: Either we train him, or...
E: gently
N: Iruka doesn’t like the sound of that ellipsis.
C: IRUKA
D: Train him.
N: Sarutobi nods. It’s decided.
C: SARUTOBI
D: We cannot tell him the whole truth. Unless you’re certain he can keep a secret.
C: IRUKA
D: No, Lord. He cannot.
S: EXT. IDYLLIC SITUATION - DAY
N: Naruto sits by a pond, feeding a little duck.
C: NARUTO
D: You may not be real, but you sure are cute.
T: Suddenly, we MATCH CUT TO:
S: INT. ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Naruto, in the Lord Hokage’s anteroom, on his hands and knees, feeding an imaginary duck. He looks up, to see Sarutobi, Iruka and Kakashi standing above him:
C: NARUTO Oh. OK. Hi.
D: That was a very cool trick, your Lordness. I’d love to know how to do that.
E: beat
C: SARUTOBI
D: It seems you will get your chance.
C: NARUTO
D: ...Shut up.
C: SARUTOBI
D: I’m issuing a special order. You’ll be admitted to the Academy to become a Shinobi.
C: NARUTO
D: This is the best day of my life!
N: Despite the grim situation, Iruka can’t help but smile.
C: NARUTO
D: My chakra’s off the charts, right? Like it felt like a LOT. Did you SEE that building?
E: CONT'D
N: The grown-ups glance at each other, like this is uncomfortably spot-on in a way Naruto doesn’t understand.
C: SARUTOBI
D: YOUNG MAN. You’re about to be playing catch-up with the most talented and driven young people in the entire nation. Are you prepared to take this seriously?
C: NARUTO
D: Oh I’m serious, Mister Lord Hokage. I’ve been waiting for this my whole life.
C: KAKASHI
D: Then let’s go.
C: NARUTO
D: Like, now?
N: Now, 3 NINJA in regalia enter, to escort Naruto to school.
C: KAKASHI
D: No time like the present.
C: NARUTO
D: So... you were wrong about me.
E: to Iruka
N: Iruka doesn’t quite know what to say:
C: IRUKA Yes, I guess so.
D: Stay in touch?
E: beat
N: They stare at each other. Each unable, or unwilling, to say how they feel in this moment. A beat.
C: NARUTO
D: Sure.
N: And for a moment, it almost looks like Naruto is going to tear up. Iruka sees a wisp of ORANGE ENERGY pulse from within him. His eyes FLASH RED. Iruka looks at him, concerned. And just as quickly, that foxfire disappears. ...Naruto walks off, never looking back. Iruka stares after the boy. Sarutobi puts his arm on his shoulder.
S: EXT. ACADEMY GATES - DAY
N: The three guards escort Naruto to THE GATES OF THE ACADEMY. The gates are three stories tall, a marvel of engineering. It takes four GATE SENTINELS to open them, with two big wheels on either side. The gates open to reveal...
S: EXT. ACADAMY CAMPUS - DAY
N: ...the sprawling Academy campus. Trees, paths, temples. All around, students spar, perform drills, hurry to class.
C: HEADMISTRESS KURENAI
D: Naruto Uzumaki?
N: HEADMISTRESS KURENAI YUHI is 40+, tough but fair.
C: NARUTO
D: Yes ma’am. Or--ninja. Ninja Mistress.
C: HEADMISTRESS KURENAI
D: Call me Major Yuhi. I’m in charge of the first form. You’ve got a lot of catching up to do. Sakura!
E: calling out
N: Leaning against a nearby wall and talking to her friends is SAKURA HARUNO (Naruto’s age, pink hair). She nods to her friends and trots over to Yuhi, standing at attention with near-military formality.
C: SAKURA
D: Yes, Major Yuhi.
N: Seeing Sakura’s perfect posture makes Naruto unconsciously adjust his own, trying to look taller and stronger. He has obviously formed an instantaneous crush on Sakura.
C: HEADMISTRESS KURENAI
D: So, this whole thing? This is what you’re going for. Sakura is a model student.
E: to Naruto indicating Sakura
C: SAKURA
D: Thank you, Major Yuhi.
C: HEADMISTRESS KURENAI
D: But don’t be a suck up. Can you show this guy around?
N: Sakura looks Naruto up and down.
C: SAKURA
D: Why?
C: HEADMISTRESS KURENAI
D: He is our new student.
C: SAKURA
D: ... Why ?
S: EXT. ACADEMY CAMPUS - DAY
N: Sakura and Naruto walk across campus.
C: SAKURA
D: School started five months ago. How’d you get in?
C: NARUTO
D: Special order from the Hokage. Because I’m so awesome, probably.
N: Sakura lets out a laugh.
C: SAKURA
D: Five months is a long time, everyone’s way ahead of you.
C: NARUTO
D: I’m not worried.
C: SAKURA
D: You should be.
C: NARUTO
D: So tell me about this place. I mean, I’ve read like a ton of books about it. But, like, they keep so much of it a secret--
N: Sakura begins her speech, by rote:
C: SAKURA
D: The Academy recruits students from all over the world. They search for young people with the most talent and bring them here, for the most intense training of their lives. Those who complete training will possess power most can’t begin to imagine. And the wisdom to wield it justly.
C: NARUTO
D: So badass.
C: SAKURA
D: Upon graduation, you will be an elite soldier, a Shinobi, and your life’s work will be the protection of Konoha from those who would harm it.
C: NARUTO
D: So where are you from?
C: SAKURA
D: Baisen Town, just outside the city. My parents have a dumpling shop.
C: NARUTO
D: Really scoured the globe for you.
N: She stops in her tracks, offended.
C: SAKURA
D: My parents gave everything to send me to the Academy.
C: NARUTO
D: Cool! No, that’s really cool. I love dumplings! I also REALLY love ramen but that’s more of a passion or like a lifelong obsession?
C: SAKURA
D: Just don’t expect me to take time away from studying to help you catch up.
N: Ino, a girl with a cocky attitude, has been playing catch nearby with a chakra ball. Now, Ino wings the chakra ball at Sakura’s head.
C: INO
D: Hey Sakura, catch!
N: Lightning-fast, Sakura does a jutsu that slices the ball in two halves that snuff out of existence. It’s AWESOME.
C: NARUTO
D: Whoa.
N: Ino’s a little embarrassed, but covers it with swagger.
C: INO
D: Nice one, forehead girl.
C: SAKURA
D: Nice one YOU, you... blonde girl.
N: They walk on. Naruto is even more smitten with Sakura.
C: NARUTO
D: You’re like... ninja rivals.
C: SAKURA
D: Pssh! Please. Ino wishes she could rival me.
N: But Sakura still gives Ino the death stare as they walk on.
S: INT. SCHOOL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: FLASH: Naruto gets his picture taken, throwing up the peace sign and sticking his tongue out. Sakura groans. Now, an ADMINISTRATOR drops a GIANT PILE OF BOOKS into Naruto’s lap.
C: NARUTO
D: ........ Thanks!
S: EXT. ACADEMY CAMPUS - DAY
N: Naruto and Sakura pass a figure silhouetted against the sky. We see him in CLOSEUP: Gazing into the distance like he’s in an old Western. Flowing black hair, piercing blue eyes. This is SASUKE UCHIHA. Sakura nervously smoothes her hair and keeps walking.
C: NARUTO
D: Who’s that?
C: SAKURA
D: Who? Oh, that? Sasuke Uchiha.
E: feigning nonchalance
C: NARUTO
D: Why is he just... standing there?
C: SAKURA
D: Uh, because he’s Sasuke Uchiha? The last of the great Uchiha clan? His entire people were wiped out? He’s been through so much.
E: sighs
C: NARUTO
D: So? I’ve been through... stuff.
E: instantly jealous
C: SAKURA
D: I hope he’s on my team.
N: Naruto gives Sasuke the stink eye as they walk on, a rivalry forming already.
C: NARUTO
D: So wait, there’s teams?
C: SAKURA
D: Teams train together. And fight together in the Chunin Exams, the final exam that determines who among us will become ninja. There’s a practice scrimmage in two weeks. But I wouldn’t worry about that. I don’t think you’ll make to the scrimmage. At any point prior, anyone can wash out. And even if you do make it to the Chunin Exams, only half the class passes. By the end of the year, only a third of all students will make it.
E: beat beat
C: NARUTO
D: Two thirds of us will fail?
C: SAKURA
D: Fail, quit or die, yeah. Statistically, a short-term coma followed by quitting is most likely. Scared yet?
C: NARUTO
D: Nope.
E: yep
N: Now A BELL IN A CLOCK TOWER CHIMES SEVERAL TIMES.
C: SAKURA
D: Come on. Time for class.
S: INT. CLASSROOM - LATER
N: KABUTO YAKUSHI (30s), a baby-faced instructor with prematurely silver hair and glasses, erases the board.
C: KABUTO
D: So as a refresher, the shadow clone jutsu was created by--
C: SAKURA SASUKE
D: Tobirama Senju! The Second Hokage.
E: emphatically coolly
C: KABUTO
D: Both correct. Axis of Excellence over here.
E: glancing between them
N: Naruto gazes dreamily at Sakura, impressed by her knowledge. Meanwhile Sakura glances shyly at Sasuke, exhilarated that they both knew the answer. And Sasuke stares into the middle distance, looking handsome.
C: KABUTO
D: New kid, page 20.
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: Sorry, Sensei.
C: KABUTO
D: And sit up straight. You sit like a worm.
C: NARUTO
D: This is as straight as I get, sir.
N: Kabuto performs a jutsu... which forces Naruto to sit PERFECTLY, UNCOMFORTABLY STRAIGHT.
C: NARUTO
D: What just happened?
E: CONT'D
C: KABUTO
D: Corporeal manipulation jutsu. Just one of the many tools of the ninja. You have a lot of catching up to do. Hinata?
N: HINATA, a student so gentle and hesitant she might be mistaken for an underwater anemone, steps to the front. She performs a jutsu and SUDDENLY THERE ARE TWO OF HER. Naruto’s jaw drops.
C: KABUTO
D: New kid. You’re next.
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: But THAT’S INSANE. You people have been in school for FIVE MONTHS?
C: KABUTO
D: Center your chakra and follow the illustrations.
C: NARUTO
D: Okay. I got this. Okay.
N: Naruto does the jutsu... and conjures a SPIKY-HAIRED, FREAKISH RAGDOLL VERSION OF HIMSELF! It sprawls, limply.
C: NARUTO
D: Gaaaah!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
N: Naruto stands in front of a LUNCH LADY, who doles out some noodles. And now, he turns, looks around nervously. THE LUNCH ROOM: various cliques, laughing, talking, etc. Everyone seems to be paired up with someone else. He gulps. Meanwhile, Sakura clicks her tray down next to Sasuke. Sasuke is studying from an illustrated tome of jutsu.
C: SAKURA
D: You studying through lunch? Whoa is that a fire style version of the shadow clone technique?
C: SASUKE
D: ...Yes.
N: Sakura sits there. Sasuke doesn’t say anything else.
C: SAKURA
D: I will leave you to it.
N: She picks up her tray to change seats.... ...and BAM, crashes right into...
C: SAKURA
D: NARUTO!
E: CONT'D
N: ...thus spilling her entire lunch on her outfit.
C: NARUTO
D: Sorry sorry!
C: SAKURA
D: You are SO CLUMSY!
N: Sasuke notices with annoyance that some errant drops of lunch have landed on his manuscript. He brushes them off and gets up to leave, bumping Naruto in the shoulder as he passes.
C: NARUTO
D: You could hand us a napkin.
E: to Sasuke
N: Sasuke turns on his heels and performs a quick, one-handed wind release jutsu. The blast of air gets most of the food off Sakura’s dress and significantly rearranges Naruto’s hair. Naruto angrily re-musses his hair to make it stand up again.
C: NARUTO
D: Hey what is your problem, anyway, who died and made you King Asshole?
E: CONT'D
N: The room goes quiet at Naruto’s over-loud voice. Sasuke looks at Naruto for a long moment... then stalks out of the room. Naruto looks around. Everyone is staring at him like HE’S the jerk. Especially the girls. And especially especially, Sakura.
C: INO
D: Dude. You KNOW his whole family died.
C: SAKURA
D: I want you to keep a ten foot radius from me at all times.
E: to Naruto
N: She storms off. Naruto sits. His juice box has upended into his ramen. He plucks it out and dries it off. Sitting nearby is Shikamaru, a genial wiseass.
C: SHIKAMARU
D: Ahhhh, I thought you guys were gonna fight. You would have died.
E: as a helpful aside:
C: NARUTO
D: I AM JUST TRYING TO EAT LUNCH.
S: INT. DORMITORY - NIGHT
N: A RESIDENT ADVISOR guides a bruised Naruto to his room. On a placard outside the door, 4 names: Choji Akimishi, Kiba Inusuka, Shino Aburame-- and Rando Tabata, (crossed out). Naruto enters. The other kids are studying. Naruto groans as he sits on his bed, rubs his sore knee.
C: NARUTO
D: Who woulda thought getting your ass kicked all day would be so painful?
N: He’s bunkmates with Choji, a heavy kid with a low-affect style of speech, maybe not neurotypical. (We saw Choji’s dad fight the Nine-Tailed Fox--the warrior with the giant fist.)
C: CHOJI
D: Everyone. That’s obvious.
C: NARUTO
D: ...You’re a real straight shooter, aren’t you.
C: CHOJI
D: I don’t know what that means. I just say stuff.
N: Having failed yet again to make a new friend, Naruto sighs and cracks open a book.
S: INT. DORMITORY - NIGHT
N: Later. Naruto’s light is the only one still on. He’s studying. Everyone else is asleep. Naruto closes his book, turns the light off, closes his eyes, tries to sleep. But quickly, his eyes open again. This kid, who’s felt alone a whole lot in his life, has never felt so alone. He rolls over in bed to look out at the sky.
S: EXT. ACADEMY CAMPUS - NIGHT
N: The pale window of the dormitory glows against the sky... And a HOODED FIGURE briskly walks past.
S: EXT. STREETS OF KONOHA - NIGHT
N: We can see who it is now: Kabuto Yakushi, the instructor who called Naruto a worm. He passes by the OCCUPIED BAR, that same bar Kidomaru stumbled into after Kakashi wrecked him. A throng of drunk Fallens loiter outside.
C: DRUNK FALLEN
D: They said I was derelict in my duties. What’s that even MEAN?
N: For a second, Kabuto copies the Fallens’ mannerisms, blending in perfectly as he weaves though the crowd.
C: KABUTO
D: THEY’RE the derelict ones, am I right?
N: As soon as Kabuto’s clear of the Fallens, the grin drops off his face. The man’s a survivor. Built to blend in.
S: INT. WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Kabuto sits in an imposing room. He’s startled by a sound. A WOMAN shuffles in, barefoot, in a plain smock that a patient might wear in a Victorian hospital.
C: WOMAN
D: Some. Tea?
N: She sounds unwell, or not in full control of her mind.
C: KABUTO
D: Thank you.
E: hiding his discomfort
N: A door opens in the opposite wall, and a man enters: OROCHIMARU. The man who unleashed the Nine-Tailed fox. Kabuto leaps out of his chair, nervous and respectful. For a second, the men regard each other. Then Orochimaru opens his arms.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: My BOY.
C: KABUTO
D: Orochimaru-sama.
N: Orochimaru comes over and musses Kabuto’s hair. He’s possessive and affection with Kabuto, who is nervous and submissive with him--a clear and stark power imbalance.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Are you eating? They feeding you over there? I hate it when you come back from that place, you look so skinny.
C: KABUTO
D: They’re feeding me, Senpai.
S: INT. OROCHIMARU’S STUDY - DAY
N: Kabuto eats a hot meal in Orochimaru’s study. Orochimaru looks out on the Konoha cityscape.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: When the Senju and Uchiha clans united to settle Konoha, the Senju gave the Uchiha control of the police force. And in exchange, the ninja Academy would be on the Senju side of town.
N: Kabuto looks out at the cityscape, at the Academy.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: That’s a good deal, isn’t it? You keep the Uchiha out of city politics, since the police have to be neutral. In exchange, you get the stronghold of the greatest martial artists that the world has ever known. Its walls made impregnable by generations of ninja. Tens of thousands of obscure jutsu in its libraries, waiting to be discovered. Whoever holds the Academy holds Konoha.
E: CONT'D
C: KABUTO
D: ...You’re going to take over the Academy.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: It’s my right. I used to be the school’s most favored son. I’ll rule the city from behind its walls.
C: KABUTO
D: ...what about the students?
C: OROCHIMARU
D: They’ll be my students. The ones that survive. And they can see for themselves the wealth of knowledge that’s been hidden from them.
N: Orochimaru takes a STUDENT ROSTER off his desk.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: So how is the last Uchiha?
E: CONT'D
C: KABUTO
D: Sasuke? Top of his class. Disciplined. Driven.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Strong native chakra?
C: KABUTO
D: The strongest I’ve seen. Why?
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Come with me.
E: walking out
N: Kabuto sets his meal aside and hurries after Orochimaru.
S: INT. OROCHIMARU'S DUNGEON - NIGHT
N: Kabuto follows Orochimaru through an underground lab.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Let me ask you something, what’s the newest jutsu you know?
C: KABUTO
D: I don’t know. Eight Inner Gates?
E: nervous
C: OROCHIMARU
D: The Eight Gates is 400 years old. Dai found it in a book and said he invented it. You see what I mean about library access.
N: They pass a vivisected cow. Kabuto looks a little ill.
C: KABUTO
D: I should really be getting back...
C: OROCHIMARU
D: What, are you nervous? What is this? Tense shoulders. What do you think I’ve got back there?
N: They round the corner to see an OPERATING TABLE... ... with a TEENAGE BOY strapped to it.
C: TEENAGE BOY
D: Hello? Is someone there?
E: straining to see them
C: OROCHIMARU
D: See? Just a normal boy. Nothing to be afraid of.
C: TEENAGE BOY
D: Please. Please let me go.
N: Kabuto turns to leave, but Orochimaru catches his arm.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Don’t look at him, look at me. Because the newest jutsu I know... goes something like this.
N: And he starts to do a jutsu that Kabuto has never seen.
C: KABUTO
D: What is that? What are you doing?
N: The teenage boy WRITHES in agony as some ineffable energy is leeched from his body, sucked up by Orochimaru.
C: TEENAGE BOY
D: Stop!!! STOP, PLEASE STOP!!!
C: KABUTO
D: You’re... taking his chakra??
C: TEENAGE BOY
D: STOP!! PLEASE!!
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Don’t look at him, look at me.
C: KABUTO
D: But--how is that even possible, I--
C: OROCHIMARU
D: KABUTO. LOOK AT ME.
N: And Kabuto looks at Orochimaru, until the screams end. He can’t bring himself to look at the poor boy’s body. Orochimaru’s LEFT HAND is still outstretched from stealing the teenager’s life force. He looks...refreshed. An now, he takes a big gulp of water, wipes his face with his upper sleeve, holds out his RIGHT HAND-- And RELEASES THE STOLEN CHAKRA IN A FLAMING BLAST, completely incinerating the boy’s body and charring half of the lab.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Now. Imagine I try that on someone with some REAL chakra.
E: CONT'D
N: And with those words, we soar back to the ACADMEY GROUNDS...
S: EXT. ACADEMY GROUNDS - NIGHT
N: ...to find NARUTO, outside late at night, practicing jutsu. Relentless. Dedicated. Again and again.
C: NARUTO
D: Dammit!
N: He pounds the ground with anger. Curiously, IT CATCHES FIRE. And a halo of foxfire seems to cloak his whole body.
C: NARUTO
D: What the....
E: CONT'D
N: Then, just as quickly, it disappears. ANGLE ON Minato’s statue. His stony gaze stares back. Pounding drums intensify, until we CUT TO BLACK.
S: INT. RAMEN PLACE - DAY
N: Naruto sits with Iruka, eating, quiet. Tension between them.
C: IRUKA
D: So how is school, Naruto?
C: NARUTO
D: Fine. How’re you? How’s... mechanic- ing?
C: IRUKA
D: Good, good. Have you made friends?
C: NARUTO
D: Tons. Why wouldn’t I have friends??
N: A long beat. Naruto sips his ramen.
C: IRUKA
D: Naruto... Are we OK?
C: NARUTO
D: ...Why wouldn’t we be?
N: A long beat.
C: NARUTO
D: It’s funny, though, I actually realized something the other day. I thought, like, all these things would change once I got in there. But now I get it. It’s me. I’m the issue. No matter where I go, I’m gonna be there. So, you know... I’ll probably never fit in. I’ll probably never find my place. And that’s fine. That’s OK. I’ve accepted that.
E: CONT'D beat beat
N: A silence.
C: NARUTO
D: Maybe you were right. Maybe I’m just...not that great.
E: CONT'D
N: Before our eyes, Naruto rallies, his native optimism rising.
C: NARUTO
D: I just gotta get one person to take me seriously, that’s it. Maybe this Sasuke guy who everyone thinks is so great. I make him respect me, then Sakura respects me, then bang bang bang I fit right in, I’m home- coming king, special handroll named after me, who’s that cruising across the campus? Oh, you don’t know? That’s Naruto Uzumaki, he’s the coolest guy in school!
E: CONT'D
C: IRUKA NARUTO
D: You don’t need to be the I know! I know I know I know coolest guy in school, I know I know I know I know I Naruto. You just need to be know I know I know I know-- who you are.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY
N: Instructor Asuma stands with a whistle, facing a group of STUDENTS who are lined up and serious AF. Among them, Naruto. Naruto glances at Sasuke, not taking Iruka’s words to heart.
C: INSTRUCTOR ASUMA
D: Candidates! ARE YOU READY?
N: In unison, they reply:
C: STUDENTS
D: YES, SIR, ASUMA-SENSEI!
C: INSTRUCTOR ASUMA
D: Begin!
E: blows whistle
N: Sasuke bursts out of the starting gate, crawls under barbed wire, leaps through tires, runs across a balance beam. Naruto runs close behind. Holding his own. Sasuke arrives at a wall. He scrambles up it with cat-like agility. So does Naruto. He closes in. They are side by side now. Looking at each other as they hurtle forward. Rivals. They reach water. Sasuke performs a jutsu and leaps across the divide. He jumps like 100 feet.
C: NARUTO
D: No way.
N: Naruto freezes in his tracks, looks ahead. He tries to jump, but he barely makes it to the middle of the water. Undaunted, he starts to swim. PAN OVER to Sarutobi and Instructor Asuma, who watch him:
C: SARUTOBI
D: How is the boy doing?
C: INSTRUCTOR ASUMA
D: Keen to prove himself. Behind on the fundamentals. We divide into teams next week. Who’s going to coach him?
E: beat
N: Sarutobi watches as SAKURA swims past Naruto--she’s a powerful swimmer, since she always has to swim this part. Naruto redoubles his efforts, trying to catch up to Sakura... and an aura of red chakra appears around him. Other students start to shout and vacate the water. Sarutobi strides to the edge of the water and touches it. It’s hot. Naruto heaves onto the shore and looks around. Everyone’s staring at him.
C: NARUTO
D: ...what?
N: Sarutobi’s brow knits with concern.
S: INT. SARUTOBI'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Kakashi stands with Sarutobi.
C: KAKASHI
D: Nope. No way. I’m not coming back here to train a bunch of spoiled, entitled, narcissistic--
C: SARUTOBI
D: No one else can train this boy.
C: KAKASHI
D: What makes you so sure I can?
C: SARUTOBI
D: You were close to his parents. You know the truth about him. I thought we could hide him away. I was wrong. His power is too great. You can get through to him, Kakashi. And you are one of the few that can put him down if you cannot.
E: beat
C: KAKASHI
D: The fight is out there. We’ve got Fallen Ninja all over. They’re angry. All they need is a leader.
C: SARUTOBI
D: The fight is within Naruto. And he needs help.
S: EXT. ACADEMY CAMPUS - THE NEXT DAY
N: The entire school, assembled. Headmistress Kurenai speaks.
C: HEADMISTRESS KURENAI
D: I’d like to congratulate our class on an excellent start to the year.
E: MORE
C: HEADMISTRESS KURENAI
D: At this juncture, only 30 percent of our students have washed out. A record. Now, the real work begins. No ninja fights alone. From today forward, you will work in teams of three. Your teammates will be your family. They will be the difference between success and failure. Life and death. From this day forward, if one member of a team washes out, so too does the whole team.
E: CONT'D applause
N: Instructor Asuma steps to the podium.
C: INSTRUCTOR ASUMA
D: Please stand with your team when you’re assigned.
N: ANGLE ON Kakashi, out of place amongst the faculty.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: Later. A few teams left to go. And now:
C: INSTRUCTOR ASUMA
D: Team 7, to be trained by Teacher Kakashi. Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno...
E: CONT'D
N: Sakura smiles, knowing she’s on Sasuke’s team. Until...
C: INSTRUCTOR ASUMA
D: Naruto Uzumaki.
E: CONT'D
N: Both Sakura and Sasuke’s faces fall. Naruto lights up.
C: NARUTO
D: Yes!
C: INSTRUCTOR ASUMA
D: Team 8, with Major Yuhi: Kiba Inuzuka, Hinata Hyuga and Shino Aburame.
N: Kiba, Hinata and Shino gather with Headmistress Kurenai. Kakashi moves to his team.
C: SAKURA
D: Sensei, are you sure this isn’t some kind of mistake?
C: KAKASHI
D: No mistake.
C: SAKURA
D: But why would they put us with him?
C: SASUKE
D: They always put the best with the worst. To make the teams fair.
C: NARUTO
D: Maybe you guys are the worst and I’m the best? Ever think of that?
C: SASUKE
D: Empirically impossible.
C: NARUTO
D: Empirically? Ha. That’s not even a word, dumbass!
C: KAKASHI
D: Sakura, you will be team leader.
C: SAKURA
D: Yes Sensei.
C: INSTRUCTOR ASUMA
D: And finally, team 10, with me: Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara, and Choji Akimichi.
C: INO
D: What what up top!!
N: Into leans over to high five Choji, delighted.
C: SAKURA
D: What are you so happy about? I’m stuck with Naruto but at least I got Sasuke.
C: INO
D: Yeah but we got the bomb.
E: indicating Choji
C: SAKURA
E: indistinct groan
C: KAKASHI
D: All right, get some rest, you three. Big scrimmage tomorrow.
S: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
N: Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura sit on a bench, facing their coach.
C: KAKASHI
D: Work as a team. And move the scroll. If you steal a scroll, you pass. If your teammate has the scroll, you block. And do not conjure a jutsu unless you are clear of defenders. Keep an eye out for traps and clones. And listen to Sakura. She’s the boss out there.
C: SAKURA
D: Thank you, Kakashi-sensei. Now Naruto, Since you’re mostly terrible at everything, is there anything you can do that we don’t know about?
C: NARUTO
D: Well, I’ve got my sideways justu. That I knocked over a building with.
C: KAKASHI
D: That’s a forbidden jutsu.
C: NARUTO
D: Oh so I can’t use that one?
C: SAKURA
D: Anything you’ve learned since you’ve been here?
C: NARUTO
D: Actually, there is one thing.
C: SAKURA
D: Great. Let’s see it.
N: Naruto’s eyes close. He thinks. And...
C: NARUTO
D: Sexy No Jutsu !
N: Suddenly, Naruto turns into a BEAUTIFUL, SCANTILY-CLAD WOMAN. Everyone stares at him.
C: KAKACHI
D: ...what are you doing?
C: SEXY NARUTO
D: I’m a distraction! Like in the middle of a fight, if a pretty girl comes up and says “hiiiii, boys.”
C: SASUKE
D: ...What if we’re not fighting boys?
C: KAKACHI
D: ...Why would a pretty girl do that?
C: SAKURA
D: ...Why would ANY girl do that?
N: Naruto reverts to his normal form.
C: NARUTO
D: Just--pssh. Trust me, okay, it would work.
C: SAKURA
D: Just make sure, if you get the scroll, you get it to one of us.
C: NARUTO
D: Why?
C: SAKURA
D: Because we’re better. You get the scroll, you pass.
E: off his look
S: EXT. TRIAL ARENA - DAY
N: The kids stand in formation in the Trial Arena. ANKO MITARASHI strides to the front. She has a throaty voice and dresses like she’s in the Matrix. Very eccentric.
C: ANKO
D: Wide-eyed and innocent children of circumstance, give me your attention, NOW!
C: NARUTO
D: Who’s that?
E: whispering
C: SAKURA
D: Ask someone else.
N: Naruto turns to his other side--Sasuke. No point asking him.
C: SHIKAMARU
D: That’s Anko Mitarashi, she’s in charge of the Chunin test.
C: ANKO
D: YO, what’s with the talking? Some kind of new jutsu you do just by flapping your gums?
C: SHIKAMARU
D: Sorry, Proctor.
C: NARUTO
D: She’s really intense.
C: ANKO
D: Welcome.... to the Chunin Trials Scrimmage, practice for the Chunin Exam which will determine which of you become ninja. As you know, the real trial will take place over thirty blocks of Konoha’s city streets. That day, the stakes will be life and death. Today, the stakes will ALSO be life and death. I could tell you no student has ever died in this scrimmage, but I would be lying.
E: enjoying the drama
N: Sakura and Sasuke look at each other, then Naruto. He smiles at them, gives them the thumbs up.
C: ANKO
D: Each team begins with one scroll. Your team’s goal is to get 2 scrolls and make it to the center tower. Where will you get this second scroll, you ask? You must take a scroll from an opposing team without losing your own.
E: CONT'D
N: VFX OVERLAY: a map, illustrating the Trial Arena and the various traps within. A dotted line animates to the center.
C: ANKO
D: Starting positions are designated on your maps. The competition begins with a sunburst.
E: CONT'D
C: SAKURA
D: Southeast quadrant. The farthest.
E: checking the map
C: NARUTO
D: Hey I got this, okay. Don’t worry.
C: ANKO
D: I DON’T. LIKE. KILLING. STUDENTS.
E: right at Naruto
C: NARUTO
D: Sorry, Proctor!
C: ANKO
D: Everyone to your starting circle.
S: EXT. STARTING CIRCLE - DAY
N: Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura stand together within a circle outlined on the ground in chalk. Above them, concrete walls 30 feet high. It is quiet. Sasuke grips a scroll tightly in his hand. And now, a FLARE SHOOTS UP INTO THE SKY. And Naruto BURSTS OUT OF THE GATE, running.
C: SAKURA
D: Where is he going?
N: MEANWHILE... Team 10 jogs in flank formation through the obstacle course. They step to the edge of a cliff. Beneath them, a huge gap. Shikamaru leaps over. Ino tosses the scroll to him. She leaps over as well. Choji looks down.
C: CHOJI
D: I’m not gonna make it... You guys go! I’ll find another way around.
N: Shikamaru and Ino join hands and use their free hands to execute a double jutsu, throwing a ROPE OF ENERGY across the valley to Choji. They pull him across.
C: CHOJI
D: Thanks.
E: CONT'D
N: They’re working as a team.
S: INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
N: A long echoey corridor, shrouded in darkness. Ino whispers.
C: INO
D: Everyone has to come through this cave to get to the tower. So we wait here, ambush them, and go for the steal.
N: A voice from behind them:
C: SEXY NARUTO
D: What’s happening, cuties?
N: They whip around to see a BEAUTIFUL, SCANTILY CLAD WOMAN. They are... confused. They stand there for a long moment.
C: CHOJI
D: What are you doing here?
C: SHIKAMARU
D: Do you need, like, a coat?
N: Interestingly, Ino is the only one having the expected glassy- eyed “hubba hubba” response.
C: INO
D: Hi, I’m Ino. I’m a ninja?
E: sidling up
C: SEXY NARUTO
D: See? You’re all distracted.
N: With that, Sexy Naruto snatches a SCROLL FROM SHIKAMARU! He reverts to his regular form, and runs out of the cave! MEANWHILE... Sasuke and Sakura move through the forest, scanning. They hear some commotion. They come upon ANOTHER STUDENT:
C: SASUKE
D: What happened?
C: OTHER STUDENT
D: Naruto stole a scroll from 10!
N: Sasuke and Sakura look at each other. They take off into the woods, running as fast as they can. MEANWHILE... Naruto hauls ass, everyone is in pursuit. Sasuke appears alongside him. Holding Team 7’s scroll.
C: NARUTO
D: Didn’t think I had it in me, huh?!
C: SASUKE
D: Naruto, pass!
C: NARUTO
D: You pass! I stole this one fair and square! I got this. They won’t expect me to take it all the way--
E: beat
C: SASUKE
D: We have a plan! Don’t be a scroll hog!
C: NARUTO
D: OK, I just need you to know...this is on you--
C: SASUKE
D: What are you talking about?!
N: Naruto SWIPES the scroll from his own teammate, accelerates.
C: NARUTO
D: You gave me no choice!
N: A furious Sasuke runs behind Naruto. Now, Sakura joins them:
C: SAKURA
D: What is he doing?! NARUTO, YOU SELFISH DICK! YOU’RE GONNA BLOW IT!
C: NARUTO
D: That’s not very nice! I’m taking this thing home!
C: SAKURA
D: Ugh. Fine. Sasuke, block for him!
N: Sasuke does, reluctantly. He turns, sees Choji turn into a GIANT BALL, that ROLLS TOWARD THEM BOTH. Sasuke turns, stops, performs some hand gestures:
C: SASUKE
D: Katon Goukakyuu no Jutsu!
N: He BLOWS FIRE at Choji, who rolls to evade and hits a tree. Sasuke turns around, a little winded. He sees Naruto heading toward the central tower. ANGLE ON NARUTO. SFX: in his head, he hears cheering. The crowd chanting his name. This is his moment. His time... ANGLE ON KAKASHI. Watching from the stands arena. Next to him, the rest of the faculty, including Sarutobi and Kabuto.
C: KAKASHI
D: Pass the freakin’ scroll, kid...
N: ANGLE ON NARUTO. Running. Beatific smile on his face. This is it! He’s gonna be the hero! Then he sees SHIKAMARU running alongside him.
C: SHIKAMARU
D: I hate you for making me run this fast.
N: They run onto a flat surface and now, their SHADOWS are visible, stretching out in front of them, overlapping.
C: SHIKAMARU
D: My turn to pick the activity. Shadow possession jutsu!
E: CONT'D
N: Now their shadows overlap and COMBINE INTO ONE.
C: NARUTO
D: No! What? Don’t possess my shadow!
N: Now, Shikamaru TOSSES HIS SCROLL over his shoulder, where it’s caught by INO. His shadow (and Naruto’s) does the same.
C: NARUTO
D: No no no no no!
E: CONT'D
N: Simultaneously and through no will of his own, Naruto tosses HIS scroll over HIS shoulder, where it’s caught by CHOJI.
C: INO
D: YES! Perfect co-ordination!
N: NARUTO’S POV: Everyone is laughing at him. Except Sasuke and Sakura, who glare. He runs to catch up, but it’s too late. Because Shikamaru, Choji, and Ino are headed to the end zone, passing, eluding defenders, and finally scoring. They hold the scrolls aloft, hug each other. Heroes.
C: INSTRUCTOR ASUMA
D: Team 7! You’re done for today! Shower up!
N: Naruto’s eyes glow red. And that halo of foxfire surrounds him. It happens quickly. So quickly no one on the field even notices. Their eyes are trained on Team 10. But from high atop the field, Sarutobi sees. As does Kakashi. He closes his eyes, troubled. Naruto walks away, hears Sasuke say to Sakura:
C: SASUKE
D: This kid’s gonna ruin our lives.
S: INT. NARUTO’S DORM - NIGHT
N: Naruto, wearing headphones, lies in bed with his eyes open. Dejected. Alone. And now, the door swings open. A SILHOUETTE APPEARS in his doorway.
C: NARUTO
D: Ahhh!
N: Naruto leaps into the fighting stance. The darkened figure SWEEPS HIS LEG, throws him to the ground, stands above him:
C: NARUTO
D: Are you here to kill me?
E: CONT'D
C: KAKASHI
D: You’re gonna wish I did.
S: EXT. ACADEMY - NIGHT
N: Sasuke and Sakura, bleary-eyed, stand at the gates of the Academy. Kakashi exits, holding Naruto by the scruff.
C: KAKASHI
D: Come on. Let’s go.
C: SAKURA
D: Where are we going?
C: KAKASHI
D: We don’t train for wars in a classroom. We train where wars are fought. Forests, hills, deserts. We will train out there to earn the right to come back here.
C: SAKURA
D: So it’ll be hot? Or cold? What should I pack?
N: But Kakashi’s already walking away.
C: SAKURA
D: How long will we be gone for?
E: CONT'D
C: KAKASHI
D: The Academy assigns us field missions in 2 months. Some time before then, hopefully. But it’ll be up to you.
C: NARUTO
D: 2 months!!?!?!?
S: EXT. WOODS - DAWN
N: The crew moves across rolling hills, in flaring sun.
S: EXT. WOODS - DAY
N: The crew trudges along, tired.
C: NARUTO
D: Are we almost there?
C: KAKASHI
D: You should’ve trusted your teammates and passed the scroll. We walk twice as far. As punishment.
C: SAKURA
D: But we had nothing to do with that!
C: KAKASHI
D: Yes you did. You were being dicks.
N: They walk.
C: NARUTO
D: So, uh, again...reeeally sorry about that scroll thing, guys.
N: No response.
C: NARUTO
D: You’re pissed. I get that.
E: CONT'D
C: SASUKE
D: Shut up, please.
S: EXT. RUSHING RIVER - SUNRISE
N: The kids walk, dejected. No one talks. They just push on. Until Kakashi stops at the river’s edge. A long beat. Silence. Everyone just looks at each other.
C: NARUTO
D: Uh, what’s happening?
C: SAKURA
D: We’re stopping.
N: Our team stands at the shore of a RUSHING RIVER. Without preamble, Kakashi begins, his back to them:
C: KAKASHI
D: A ninja must focus. Must tune everything out.
E: MORE
C: KAKASHI
D: This is how we access our chakra... Our spiritual energy. You can’t get too excited. But you also cannot relax. You must find that moment in between. The moment that is now.
E: CONT'D beat
N: ANGLE ON Naruto, who has no idea what the fuck Kakashi is talking about. But he watches, in awe, as Kakashi steps onto the rushing river and WALKS ON WATER.
C: KAKASHI
D: Get in.
E: CONT'D
N: They stand there, staring at Kakashi in awe.
C: KAKASHI
D: I said get in!
E: CONT'D
N: Team 7 jumps into the river, swimming out to the middle. Fighting against the current.
C: KAKASHI
D: Focus your chakra into the soles of your feet. Feel it move down through you. Brea--
E: CONT'D
N: Kakashi looks up. Sasuke is already walking on water.
C: SAKURA NARUTO
D: Oh come ON. This is ridiculous.
N: Sakura splashes water at Sasuke.
C: SASUKE
D: Did you just... splash me?
N: Naruto bobs up and down in the water.
C: NARUTO
D: I got it! No I don’t!
N: Sakura struggles to rise on the water, competing with Naruto.
C: KAKASHI
D: Sakura, don’t try so hard. Naruto, try harder.
N: Sakura closes her eyes, and almost gives up. And in giving up, she starts to float. Wobbling against the rushing water.
C: SAKURA
D: Ha! Haha!
C: KAKASHI
D: Like the flow of a battle, the surface of the water is unpredictable. You are the only thing you can control.
N: Balancing on the surface, Sakura gets a mischievous look. She splashes Sasuke again. This time, Sasuke smiles, and splashes back. Flirting. Poor Naruto’s still treading water.
C: NARUTO
D: Arrrghhnngngn....!!!
E: dying of jealousy
N: But now Sakura HEARS SOMETHING.
C: SAKURA
D: Um, guys. Do you hear that?
N: They look downstream to see a MASSIVE WATERFALL.
C: KAKASHI
D: That is today’s test.
E: O.S.
N: They turn to find Kakashi standing on the shore:
C: KAKASHI
D: Don’t go over that waterfall.
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: Wait, how?
C: KAKASHI
D: Teamwork. Or something.
E: shrugs
N: He watches impassively as they drift away on the current.
C: SAKURA
D: Everyone hold hands. Naruto, let--
C: NARUTO
D: I can do it, just give me a sec--
E: struggling, thrashing
C: SAKURA
D: No listen to me, let us lift you--
C: SASUKE
D: We’re losing ground!
C: NARUTO
D: Sasuke, can’t you create, like, a force field or something?
C: SAKURA
D: Don’t tell him what to do. You’re not team leader.
C: NARUTO
D: It was just an idea! I’m spitballing!
C: SASUKE
D: You’re both acting like children!
N: For a second Sakura STARES at Sasuke, outraged to be included. Then she STARTS WAILING ON NARUTO.
C: NARUTO
D: Hey! I was trying to do teamwork!
C: SAKURA NARUTO
D: TEAM. WORK. MEANS. DO. WHAT. Hey I--ouch--stop hitting me! I. SAY!
E: CONT'D
N: ...And with that they go over the falls, disappearing into the roar of pounding water and boulders below.
S: EXT. LOWER RIVER - DAY
N: Sasuke, Sakura, and Naruto drag themselves up onto the river bank, half-drowned and exhausted, bleeding from numerous
T: scrapes and cuts.
N: Kakashi sits under a tree nearby, reading a novel called “Savage Lust”, which features a hot Ninja couple on the cover, making out.
C: KAKASHI
D: What was the point of today’s mission?
N: Sasuke looks disdainfully at his teammates.
C: SASUKE
D: To shut out distractions.
C: KAKASHI
D: No. I placed you in an impossible situation: none of you possess the chakra to overcome the current. You were destined to fail.
C: NARUTO
D: So what was the point?
C: KAKASHI
D: To see how you fail, kid.
C: NARUTO
D: So...like, did we fail OK?
C: KAKASHI
D: No. You failed terribly.
S: EXT. WOODLAND TRAIL - DAY
N: The sun sets as they trudge up a challenging trail. Sakura walks faster to catch up to Kakashi.
C: SAKURA
D: Sensei, I had a plan for the waterfall.
C: KAKASHI
D: You’re the leader, that’s your job.
C: SAKURA
D: But they won’t listen! They think they’re the greatest ninja alive.
N: They trudge on. Kakashi realizes she’s waiting for an answer.
C: KAKASHI
D: Why are you telling me this? Tell them.
N: Sakura looks back at Naruto and Sasuke, her mind working.
S: EXT. CAMPSITE - DUSK
N: A WILD BOAR runs through dense brush, and now, from nowhere A BLADE LACED WITH ENERGY SLICES THROUGH IT. The boar falls the ground, dead. Kakashi walks to it, grabs it by the legs. REVEAL the kids, looking on in horror.
C: NARUTO
D: I’m not, like, a huge pork guy.
C: KAKASHI
D: This isn’t for you.
C: SAKURA
D: So what are we eating?
C: KAKASHI
D: Whatever you catch. I recommend the squirrel.
S: EXT. CAMPSITE - DUSK
N: A fire roars. On a spit, a pig picked to the bone. And Kakashi, picking his teeth and reading “Savage Lust”. Naruto is the first to return.
C: NARUTO
D: You enjoying that?
C: KAKASHI
D: It’s not bad.
N: Naruto slumps. Soon after, Sakura and Sasuke arrive.
C: SAKURA
D: How’d you do?
E: beat
C: NARUTO
D: I ate a flower and threw up.
C: SAKURA
D: No luck here either.
N: Sasuke walks straight through their camp and sits in a moonlit clearing to meditate.
C: NARUTO
D: So pretentious. What are you reading?
E: to Kakashi
C: KAKASHI
D: Nothing.
C: NARUTO
D: Can I see?
C: KAKASHI
D: Take it from me--
N: Before Kakashi finishes the sentence, Naruto JUMPS at him. Kakashi blocks him and Naruto rolls into the fire, knocking over the pig on a stick and sending embers up into the dusk. This gets Sasuke’s attention.
C: KAKASHI
D: You know what? As soon as one of you gets this book from me, we can all go back to the school.
E: CONT'D
N: Now, they all start to pay attention. Sasuke and Sakura make eye contact. They both begin to circle Kakashi. He backs up. They move toward him in a line, and charge... THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY HOOKED INTO 2 NETS AND HOISTED HIGH ABOVE THE JUNGLE.
C: NARUTO
D: Ha! Can’t believe you two fell for that.
C: SASUKE
D: Don’t do it, Naruto! It’s a trap!
C: NARUTO
D: I got this, Sasuke!
N: He dusts the soot off himself, and charges Kakashi, dodging the area that got Sakura and Sasuke caught. To his surprise, he gets right up to him. Kakashi is still reading the book. Naruto swipes for it. Without taking his eyes off the book, Kakashi simply pushes Naruto--who wobbles a few steps back, FALLS INTO THE TRAP AND IS HOISTED INTO A TREE.
C: NARUTO
D: Dammit! It was a trap!
E: CONT'D
N: They all three hang upside down. Naruto looks away, refusing to make eye contact with the others, who glare at him.
C: KAKASHI
D: Those are two of best students in school. You should think about listening to them.
E: to Naruto
N: And with that, Kakashi disappears. As Team 7 attempts to extricate themselves from the trap.
S: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
N: Darkness. Naruto sleeps peacefully in the trap.
C: SAKURA
D: HOW IS HE SLEEPING.
C: SASUKE
D: He doesn’t think. It’s easy for people who don’t think.
N: Sakura looks at Naruto, blissfully sleeping like a child.
C: SAKURA
D: I don’t think that’s exactly true.
N: Now she studies Sasuke’s face, turned away, unreadable.
C: SAKURA
D: You know, his parents died too. So... you have something in common.
E: CONT'D gently
N: Sasuke doesn’t respond.
C: SAKURA
D: I mean not that I should talk, I know I’m super hard on him. He just-- ARGG, he really gets under my skin.
E: CONT'D
N: Sasuke still doesn’t respond.
C: SAKURA
D: You know, maybe if--
E: CONT'D
N: She stops herself, and we watch her have a small but important personal revelation.
C: SASUKE
D: ...Were you gonna say something?
C: SAKURA
D: You know what: no. I’m done trying to get through to you. You should try asking me how I feel sometime.
N: Awkwardly, she scoots in the trap, turning away from him. Sasuke looks... surprised. He tries to form words, but none come. He stares into the night, alone with his thoughts.
S: EXT. WOODS - MORNING
N: Their eyes open to the sound of a rope being sliced. They all fall to the ground.
C: KAKASHI
D: Good morning.
N: Naruto pops to his feet.
C: NARUTO
D: Good morning!
N: Sakura groans and slumps on the ground. It’s going to be a long day. LESSON TIME. Kakashi walks to a tree. And WALKS STRAIGHT UP IT! Defying gravity.
C: KAKASHI
D: Concentrate your chakra in the souls of your feet.
E: MORE
C: KAKASHI
D: The first one to reach the top of this tree gets dinner.
E: CONT'D
N: They each walk to the base of the tree. Naruto and Sasuke lock eyes, competitive. They START: Each is able to run about four steps up the tree, but Naruto comes unstuck and Sasuke SPLINTERS THE TREE BARK WITH HIS FEET, his blazing chakra severing the connection. They try again.
C: SASUKE
D: Why are you smiling?
C: NARUTO
D: Because we both suck at this. We’re finally on the same level.
N: Naruto hugs the tree and tries to climb using his legs... It’s ridiculous.
C: SASUKE
D: We’re not on the same level. Get out of the way.
C: NARUTO
D: Yes we are.
E: groaning with effort
C: SASUKE
D: Is everything a joke to you?
N: Now Sasuke climbs OVER Naruto, burning him with chakra.
C: NARUTO
D: OW!!!! What is your problem?
C: SAKURA
D: HEY IDIOTS, CHECK ME OUT!
N: She is SITTING ON A TREE BRANCH HIGH ABOVE THEM. Naruto looks up, angry. He tries again. But he still can’t do it. His eyes flash with red. And he does the FORBIDDEN JUTSU he learned from Kidomaru. BWWRRRRKKK the pressure-wave of wrongness hits Sasuke in the back of the head-- SLOW MOTION AS: Sasuke, dazed, lifts his eyes to see SAKURA, falling. He lurches forward and CATCHES HER IN HIS ARMS. The tree trunk is OFFSET, the top no longer lining up with the bottom, and the whole tree creaks and FALLS in a cloud of disturbed sparrows. Sakura finds herself in Sasuke’s arms. He sets her on her feet, and pukes. Sakura stares in horror at Naruto.
C: SAKURA
D: What the hell was that??
E: CONT'D
N: Naruto steps on the topmost branch of the felled tree.
C: NARUTO
D: I got to the top!
N: Kakashi’s eyes narrow with anger. He moves toward Naruto, grabs him by the scruff, takes him into the woods, and...
S: EXT. DEEPER WOODS - CONTINUOUS
N: ...throws him against a tree.
C: NARUTO
D: OW!
C: KAKASHI
D: What is wrong with you?!
C: NARUTO
D: Come on! It was kinda clever!
C: KAKASHI
D: That’s a FORBIDDEN JUTSU. What part of that was unclear?
C: NARUTO
D: OBVIOUSLY I DON’T KNOW WHAT FORBIDDEN MEANS! I didn’t go to a fancy school or whatever!!
N: Kakashi looks at Naruto... and a realization washes over him. He releases Naruto. His sudden calm is scarier than anything. He storms off. Naruto stares after him.
C: NARUTO
D: Wait, Kakashi-Sensei? Are you done... ...yelling at me?
E: CONT'D with a heavy sigh
S: EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT
N: Dinnertime. Kakashi is sitting far from the students. Naruto watches Kakashi, wondering how much trouble he’s in. He looks over to meet Sasuke’s eye--Sasuke is PISSED. They’re distracted by a loud GROAN. It’s Sakura, eating the barbecued rabbit she earned as the first to climb the tree. She notices them noticing.
C: SAKURA
D: ...Sorry.
N: Naruto takes a deep breath and half-mumbles the words:
C: NARUTO
D: I’m also sorry.
N: Sakura takes that in. She clocks Kakashi--he’s not looking. She holds out a leg of rabbit. Naruto nods, grabs it on the DL. He closes his eyes in ecstasy, mouths:
C: NARUTO
D: Thank you.
E: CONT'D silently
N: Now she offers Sasuke a piece.
C: SASUKE
D: No. I didn’t earn it.
C: NARUTO
D: Can I have his?
E: whispers
S: EXT. PATH BY THE RIVER - DAY
N: Bright day. Kakashi, incongruously, SINGS TO HIMSELF as he guides the kids on a short walk. They glance at each other.
C: SASUKE
D: Sensei, if this is about Naruto being disciplined I would prefer to have the morning to practice.
N: They arrive at a clearing.... Where SARUTOBI sits on a stump. A crane takes flight as the great leader rises to greet them.
C: SARUTOBI
D: Team Seven.
N: The kids, wide-eyed, bow and stutter their “Lord Hokage”s. Sarutobi performs a jutsu that blows all the dry leaves away, exposing stumps and logs for them to sit down on. They gather around him in a sort of forest counsel.
C: SARUTOBI
D: I was told one of you performed a forbidden jutsu.
E: CONT'D
C: SASUKE SAKURA
D: It was Naruto. It was--
C: SARUTOBI
D: ...and that the others need to learn co-operation.
N: Everyone is chastened. Sarutobi takes in their surroundings.
C: SARUTOBI
D: The chakra of the ninja has two aspects--
E: CONT'D
C: SAKURA
D: Yin and yang.
C: SARUTOBI
D: ...thank you, Sakura. We practice many jutsu that release one or the other. But there must be balance. Forbidden jutsu are those that upset the balance. They produce unnatural acts. And you must never use them.
N: Naruto looks between Kakashi and Sarutobi. Was that it?
C: NARUTO
D: I understand, Lord Hokage.
C: SARUTOBI
D: Not quite. I mean you, Naruto, in particular.
C: NARUTO
D: ...because I have so much chakra?
C: SARUTOBI
D: You don’t have a lot of chakra, Naruto. You’re the vessel for a being made of pure chakra.
C: NARUTO
D: ...what?
C: SARUTOBI
D: The energy inside you has a name. It’s called The Nine-Tailed Fox.
N: Naruto doesn’t say anything for a really long time. Sakura covers her mouth. Kakashi looks at the ground.
C: NARUTO
D: No. No that can’t be right.
C: SARUTOBI
D: Your parents sealed the Nine-Tails inside you so the city could be saved. And it lives in you still.
C: NARUTO
D: No, but that’s... Iruka’s whole family died in that attack.
C: SARUTOBI
D: And so did yours. Your father was Minato Namikaze.
C: NARUTO
D: ...he was named after the Fourth Hokage?
C: SARUTOBI
D: He was the Fourth Hokage. He wore the Omoni after I did in my term as Third Hokage. I took it up again after he died.
C: NARUTO
D: I’m the son of the Fourth Hokage.
N: Sarutobi nods.
C: NARUTO
D: And you’re telling me this now? Why’s my last name Uzumaki?
E: CONT'D beat
C: SARUTOBI
D: Because it was your mother’s name. She was an Uzumaki from Uzushiogakure. She came to Konoha when she was just a little girl.
S: EXT. JINCHURICHI TEMPLE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
N: LITTLE KUSHINA is led by a group of adults in ceremonial attire, towards some kind of temple. She spots a little blonde boy in the crowd: LITTLE MINATO. She breaks the grip of the adult leading her.
C: LITTLE KUSHINA
D: I don’t wanna go inside!
S: INT. SARUTOBI'S OFFICE - DAY
C: SARUTOBI
D: She was a lot like you, Naruto. She was very hotheaded. Impulsive. She used to say she wanted to be the first female Hokage. If the world had been a little different, maybe she would have been.
N: The thought gives Naruto SOME kind of comfort.
C: NARUTO
D: And... what about my dad?
C: SARUTOBI
D: Minato? He was... Level-headed. Responsible. Respectful. And gentle.
S: EXT. JINCHURICHI TEMPLE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
N: Little Minato watches Little Kushina, filled with empathy. He looks up to ask his dad:
C: LITTLE MINATO
D: Why does she have to go?
S: INT. SARUTOBI'S OFFICE - DAY
C: NARUTO
D: So... nothing like me at all.
C: SARUTOBI
D: You may find him in you, one day. They both had unbeatable spirits. Just like yours. They complimented each other.
S: EXT. MOMENTS THROUGHOUT TIME (FLASHBACK)
N: Minato and Kushina grow alongside each other, train alongside each other, fall in love. Leading us to...
S: EXT. BARRICADE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: ...the night of the Nine-Tails attack. Kushina strides towards the fox in her hastily-donned ninja attire, sees her husband racing towards the two little boys. This time we see Kushina perform the binding jutsu in full: a circular motion in her hands, circling and winding tight. The fox freezes where it stands. The invisible chains groan.
C: SARUTOBI
D: The Nine-Tails attacked... almost at the very moment of your birth.
E: V.O.
N: Now Kushina’s dishevelment makes sense, as do Minato’s words:
C: MINATO
D: Kushina, get back inside!
C: KUSHINA
D: Don’t tell me what to do!
N: Minato and Kushina realize: The bonds won’t hold.
C: SARUTOBI
D: They both knew what they had to do.
E: V.O.
N: And now, every step heavy with destiny, Minato comes to stand alongside Kushina. He looks up at the fox.
C: MINATO
D: Are you ready?
C: KUSHINA NO! YOU IDIOT. No.
D: We were supposed to get old together.
C: MINATO
D: I am so sorry, my love.
C: SARUTOBI
D: Minato summoned the fox’s yin energy into himself...
E: V.O.
N: Minato performs his last jutsu, that last act of faith, and THE ENERGY OF THE FOX SEEMS TO FLOW INTO HIM. Kushina YELLS IN FURY as she holds the fox’s chains-- The frame fills with fire and sound but we KEEP WATCHING: With its white yin energy drained, the fox is now deeper red, even more rageful--
C: MINATO
D: NOW!
N: Kushina DROPS the fox’s chains and they both RUN.
S: INT. MATERNITY ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: Kushina and Minato CHARGE into a maternity cabin--the room where Naruto was born. And BABY NARUTO is there. Kushina cradles her baby, kisses his head, looks in his eyes. He’s crying, but he settles when he sees her face. And the cabin shakes as the fox comes towards them.
C: SARUTOBI
D: ...And your mother called its yang energy into you.
E: V.O.
N: Kushina performs her final jutsu, and the fox’s yang energy starts flowing into Naruto.
S: EXT. KONOHA SKYLINE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: The fox can FEEL ITS ENERGY BEING STOLEN. It begins to UNRAVEL, losing shape and integrity, flames spilling everywhere. It FALLS over on its flank, crushing buildings, in agony. It is DYING. And it’s searching for whoever is killing it.
S: INT. MATERNITY ROOM - DAY
N: Inside the cabin, Kushina’s still doing the jutsu, and baby Naruto’s belly starts to GLOW.
S: INT. SARUTOBI'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Naruto looks down. The sigil on his belly.
C: NARUTO
D: My birthmark.
C: SARUTOBI
D: They saved us all.
C: NARUTO
D: How’d they die?
C: SARUTOBI
D: The fox took their lives as they bound it inside you.
S: INT. KONOHA SKYLINE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: The fox finally locates the thing that is robbing its energy--
S: INT. MATERNITY ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: --and its CLAW CRASHES THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE CABIN. Minato and Kushina shield Naruto with their bodies as the fox’s mighty claw impales them.
S: INT. SARUTOBI'S OFFICE - DAY
C: NARUTO
D: That means... I killed them.
C: SARUTOBI
D: The Nine Tails is a part of you, yes. But it is not you.
N: Naruto jumps to his feet. He wants to be anywhere else.
C: NARUTO
D: Who else knows about this?
C: SARUTOBI
D: A few. Kakashi. Iruka.
N: Naruto closes his eyes. This pains him.
C: NARUTO
D: And whose idea was it...to lie to me like this? Was it my parents’?
C: SARUTOBI
D: It was mine. We had no choice, Naruto.
E: softly
C: NARUTO
D: Adults always say that to me. And what’s weird is, it’s never true. I have to go.
E: beat
C: KAKASHI
D: Naruto, you should--
N: Sarutobi waves Kakashi off, and Naruto darts away into the trees. Sasuke and Sakura reel.
S: EXT. ROOFTOPS OF KONOHA - DUSK
N: Naruto leaps from building to building with determination... He slows as he passes that GRAPHITTI MURAL OF THE FOX ATTACK. He sees Minato. And Kushina. And the NINE-TAILED FOX. They are shielding the city with their bodies, dying in fire. Naruto lifts his shirt, puts his hand on his belly. He looks back up at the mural. He is the fox, and the fox is killing his parents.
S: INT. IRUKA’S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Iruka watches a talk show on TV (a Johnny Carson-esque host interviews a Ninja). Now, his door opens. Revealing Naruto.
C: NARUTO
D: Why didn’t you tell me?
C: IRUKA I wasn’t allowed to.
D: Come in.
E: beat
N: Naruto does.
C: NARUTO
D: So you spent your entire life just lying to me? Who does that?
C: IRUKA
D: The elders said it was for the best. I was doing my duty.
C: NARUTO
D: And you’re like, what? Some super ninja?
C: IRUKA
D: I am a ninja, yes.
C: NARUTO
D: That explains why you’re such a shitty mechanic.
N: Iruka looks down. A long beat.
C: NARUTO
D: So, how did it work?
E: CONT'D
C: IRUKA
D: I was a young Ninja, about your age. I had just lost everyone I loved. And Lord Sarutobi came to me. He told me I was to be a father. It was a matter of national security, he said. Then he handed me this... ...this beautiful little boy. Who held untold power within him. You wrapped your little hand around my thumb and smiled. And I began to cry. They gave me a dossier. An apartment. A job. I did as I was told.
E: he tears up
C: NARUTO
D: I never knew the real you.
C: IRUKA
D: I always knew the real you. I was just waiting for you to find out for yourself.
C: NARUTO
D: But you wouldn’t let me go to the Academy.
C: IRUKA
D: I did as they asked. For my country. The firepower within you-- it could destroy worlds.
C: NARUTO
D: I am not some weapon. I am a person. I’m a kid!
C: IRUKA
D: You think it was easy? Living with you, knowing that thing was inside you? The thing that killed my parents? My friends? I devoted my life to you.
C: NARUTO
D: At least you had a choice. I never asked for that! I never asked for any of it! You were supposed to take care of me. You were supposed to love me.
E: beat
N: Iruka looks away.
C: IRUKA
D: You’re right.
C: NARUTO
D: What?
C: IRUKA
D: I said you’re right. And I’m wrong. And I’m sorry.
N: It’s the first time Naruto has ever heard an adult admit fault. He softens.
C: IRUKA
D: Let me make you some ramen.
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: I guess ramen sounds OK.
S: INT. NARUTO & IRUKA'S HOME - LATER
N: Naruto looks out at the setting sun from the balcony outside his old bedroom. He scarfs down ramen. Iruka sits in his chair, watching an old wild west show with a ninja cowboy.
C: NARUTO
D: I’m sorry you had to give up your whole life for me. It’s not fair.
C: IRUKA
D: I didn’t give up my life. You became my life. And I don’t regret that choice for a single second. I lost my parents, but I gained you. And I love you more than you know.
C: NARUTO
D: I want to quit the Academy and just live a simple life. Like you always wanted for me. I want this thing out of me.
E: beat
C: IRUKA
D: It doesn’t work that way. You either learn to work with it... or it will kill you, and everyone you know.
N: Naruto takes this in. It’s A LOT.
S: EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
N: Back at camp, Kakashi, Sakura and Sasuke eat rabbit.
C: SAKURA
D: ...it’s quiet without Naruto.
N: Kakashi pauses, takes that in. It isn’t quiet in a good way.
S: EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT
N: Later. Sasuke meditates in moonlight, but his mind wanders.
S: EXT. STREETS OF KONOHA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: The briefest of memories: one little boy carrying another, running barefoot as the Nine-Tailed Fox attacks. Was Sasuke one of those two boys? Commotion from the campfire breaks Sasuke’s train of thought.
S: EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
N: Sasuke comes back to camp to see Naruto, just-returned, standing with Kakashi.
C: KAKASHI
D: Hopefully you all understand now how serious this is. The Nine- Tailed Fox was released once before. It can’t happen again. Remember to work as a team, and protect Naruto.
C: NARUTO
D: Well--I’m getting pretty strong. I can protect you guys, too--
C: KAKASHI NARUTO.
D: This team has one purpose: keep Naruto out of the wrong hands.
C: NARUTO
D: ...go team.
E: weakly
N: Sakura smiles, weakly, back at him. Sasuke’s expression changes--does he finally have compassion?
S: EXT. RIVER - NIGHT
N: Naruto, shirtless, exhausted, stands knee-deep in the river. For a moment his gaze racks focus to the water’s surface. His reflection. The moon backlighting his hair like foxfire.
C: NARUTO
D: Stupid--symbolic reflective surface.
E: turning away
N: He sees a flash of orange--a fish! He shoots a LIGHTNING JUTSU into the water, electrocuting himself. When he recovers, he sees: SEVERAL FISH, BURNT TO A CRISP.
C: NARUTO
D: Hah! Haha!!
E: CONT'D triumphantly
N: He grabs one, bites its head off, when he looks up to notice: SAKURA, coming to the water’s edge wrapped in a sarong.
C: NARUTO
D: Hey.
E: CONT'D mouth full
C: SAKURA
D: Oh! Hey! I was just coming to...you know. Get clean.
C: NARUTO SAKURA
D: Cool. No no, you stay here, I’ll find somewhere else-- Oh I can--go somewhere else I just--
E: CONT'D realizing
C: NARUTO
D: Na, I was done anyway.
E: CONT'D
N: Naruto comes to shore to dry off. Sakura’s eyes land on his bellybutton. And the SIGIL.
C: NARUTO
D: They told me it was a birth mark.
E: CONT'D following her gaze
N: Sakura stands tall, like she’s encouraging him to do the same.
C: SAKURA
D: It is. It tells the story of your birth.
C: NARUTO
D: Kind of a shitty story, though.
C: SAKURA
D: It’s a sad story. But that’s not the same thing.
E: shaking her head
N: Another long beat. Naruto holds up the crispy fish:
C: NARUTO
D: Fish?
C: SAKURA
D: Uh... no thanks.
N: She unwraps the towel she was wearing, revealing her underwear, and steps into the water to bathe.
C: NARUTO
D: Hey... Are there any jutsu that let you talk to people that died?
E: she stops
N: Sakura shakes her head, sadly.
C: SAKURA
D: When people come back from the dead it’s... usually not a good thing.
N: Now she swims on her back, giving herself to the water. FROM ABOVE, it looks like she’s floating among the stars reflected on the water’s surface. Naruto’s sigil glows orange.
C: NARUTO
D: Settle down, buddy.
E: to the sigil
S: INT. OCCUPIED BAR - NIGHT
C: TAYUYA
D: Well look who’s back from the dead. Never thought I’d see that face again.
N: OROCHIMARU has entered the OCCUPIED BAR, Kabuto at his side. Everyone goes dead quiet, whispers to one another.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Just here for a drink, Tayuya. Guys, please. Carry on.
N: Orochimaru and Kabuto sit. The others gather around them.
C: TAYUYA
D: We were just saying someone should teach the Shinobi a lesson.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: You say that a lot.
E: laughing
N: SAKON is next to speak. He is a stunningly gorgeous man who shares a body with UKON, another stunningly gorgeous man.
C: SAKON
D: One of them just busted up one of our warehouses, and wrecked Kidomaru.
C: KIDOMARU
D: False. I’ve still got three more good hands than you do.
N: Kidomaru snaps a fist with his five good hands.
C: UKON
D: ...And not even one handsome face.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: So you were attacked on your own private property.
N: Everyone ERUPTS at this. Orochimaru knows his audience.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: It’s not enough that they control the Academy, they have to come to where WE live?
E: CONT'D
N: Someone whoops agreement. Orochimaru leans in, gets folksy.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Let me tell you what, friends, there’s so much more to the art of the ninja than you know. And you’re never going to know it. Because they’re not going to let you.
E: CONT'D
N: There’s jutsu you’ve never dreamed of. There’s jutsu that haven’t been invented. And they never will be. As long as those... those mediocrities keep hiding behind those alabaster walls, afraid of what our power can do. We could be so much more than what we are. (MORE)
C: OROCHIMARU
D: “Forbidden jutsu,” they say. Why should power be forbidden? Why should progress be forbidden?
E: CONT'D
C: TAYUYA
D: Why don’t you do something about it?
C: OROCHIMARU
D: No no no, find someone else. I’m not job hunting.
N: JIROBO (7 feet tall, 300 pounds), bangs the table.
C: JIROBO
D: Orochi. Maru. Orochi. Maru.
E: chanting
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Please--I’m just here for a drink.
C: EVERYONE JOINING IN
D: Orochi! Maru! Orochi! Maru!
N: Two of them hoist his chair up and he steps onto the table. Orochimaru’s eyes meet Kabuto’s through the crowd. Orochimaru winks. Kabuto realizes: Orochimaru planned this. Everyone’s riled. Someone drags the bartender from behind the bar and throws him on the ground.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: All right all right, there is ONE little trick I can show you.
C: BARTENDER
D: No, stop! STOP!!
N: Kabuto looks around, alarmed by the violence in the room, as: Orochimaru starts doing his newest jutsu on the bartender.
S: INT. BAR - NIGHT
N: THWACK, a dart hits a board. In a way more peaceful bar across town, Iruka and Kakashi play darts.
C: IRUKA
D: So how IS Naruto.
N: Kakashi sighs. This is weighing on him.
C: KAKASHI
D: You think we did the right thing?
C: IRUKA
D: You mean by lying? Or by finally telling the truth?
C: KAKASHI
D: I just needed him to take all this seriously.
C: IRUKA
D: Naruto doesn’t joke around because he doesn’t take things seriously.
C: KAKASHI
D: That’s the definition of joking around.
C: IRUKA
D: The boy lost both his parents. At his core, he fears everyone will abandon him. He laughs to cover his pain.
C: KAKASHI
D: But he’s always laughing.
C: IRUKA
D: Well, life is a precious gift. And life can be very painful. At least know somebody who can laugh about it.
N: THWOCK: Iruka scores a bullseye. THWOCK: Kakashi splits Iruka’s dart right down the middle. They reset the board.
C: KAKASHI
D: I miss the good old days when you could just beat a kid into listening to you.
C: IRUKA
D: It might help him to know someone will be there with him. In the pain. So he doesn’t have to face it alone. That thing inside him, the more he suppresses it, the stronger it gets. What if you just let it out? Together.
E: beat
C: KAKASHI
D: Like hold hands with it? Sing songs around the campfire?
C: IRUKA
D: Just lead with your heart.
E: shrugs
C: KAKASHI
D: I think I’m gonna puke.
C: IRUKA
D: More sake?
S: EXT. CAMPSITE - DAWN
N: Late night/early morning. Kakashi comes back to camp to find: Sakura, sleeping under a graceful shelter of pine boughs. Sasuke sleeping just outside, like he’s guarding Sakura. Naruto, flopped over ten feet away like a ragdoll that slept where it landed. Kakashi sighs and shakes Naruto awake.
C: KAKASHI
D: Naruto. Naruto.
S: EXT. WOODS - DAWN
N: Naruto sits at the edge of the lake. Kakashi stands above him, looking a little worse for wear. He hands him a balloon filled with water:
C: NARUTO
D: Long night, Kakashi-sensei?
N: Kakashi ignores him.
C: KAKASHI
D: Your job is to make the water spin. The balloon will float. But don’t let it pop.
C: NARUTO
D: How?
C: KAKASHI
D: Use your chakra. And your focus. We sit here, and say nothing, until that balloon floats.
C: NARUTO
D: But--
C: KAKASHI
D: Nope. No more talking. Not until you do something.
N: Naruto nods. He gets it. And he sits there, silently, staring at the balloon.
S: EXT. WOODS - HOURS LATER
N: Naruto, still focused intensely on the balloon, sits in the woods. Sweat pours down his brow as the sun beats down upon him. Next to him, Kakashi flips through his romance novel. And now, the water inside the balloon starts to spin. Naruto smiles. Kakashi puts his book down.
C: KAKASHI
D: There you go. Focus. Don’t try to do too--
N: The Balloon pops. Naruto PUNCHES THE GROUND.
C: NARUTO
D: DAMMIT!
C: KAKASHI
D: Much. No yelling.
C: NARUTO You’re hungover, Kakashi-sensei! I
D: can tell!
C: KAKASHI
D: I said no yelling!
N: Naruto drops to the ground, starts doing push ups:
C: KAKASHI
D: What’re you doing?
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: Just assumed that’s where this was headed.
C: KAKASHI
D: No, no, get up, kid. It’s OK. Here.
N: Kakashi reaches into his utility bag, throws him a Power Bar.
C: NARUTO
D: You serious?
C: KAKASHI
D: Eat. You tell me when you’re ready to go again.
N: Naruto smiles. He takes a bite.
C: NARUTO
D: K. I’m ready.
E: mouth full
C: KAKASHI OK. Quiet your mind...
D: And think about the now. Not the future. Not the past. Now. Feel the wind on your face. Listen to the rustling of the leaves-- Does this makes you uncomfortable?
E: beat off his look
N: Naruto tries to sit, but is fidgety.
C: NARUTO
D: No.
C: KAKASHI
D: You sure look uncomfortable, kid. I get it. If you’re in the present, then you have to contend with all that... stuff inside you.
C: NARUTO
D: You mean... the fox?
C: KAKASHI
D: I mean your feelings.
N: Naruto’s surprised to hear that. Kakashi presses on:
C: KAKASHI
D: Naruto. How do you feel?
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: I feel great, you’re the one that needs to stick your head in a bucket.
C: KAKASHI
D: Really?
C: NARUTO
D: Believe it!
C: KAKASHI
D: You never met your parents. Wondered all your life who they were, if they abandoned you. Found out they both died the day you were born. They made you a container for the worst devastation our city has ever known. And no one’s told you the truth about it until now.
E: MORE
C: KAKASHI
D: You’re not angry? Sad? Here. Try. Go there.
E: CONT'D
N: He hands him the balloon.
C: NARUTO
D: I don’t want to.
C: KAKASHI
D: Why not?
C: NARUTO
D: Everything just... feels so out of control inside me.
C: KAKASHI
D: Of course it does. You’re a teenager.
C: KAKASHI
D: Naruto, you won’t be... betraying yourself if you face your sadness. You’ll still be you. You’ll still be that same... ...spirited trickster.
E: CONT'D
N: Naruto looks up at Kakashi, feeling vulnerable and exposed.
C: KAKASHI
D: It’s only when we suppress our grief, or we try to deny it--that’s when it takes the wrong form. If you learn to embrace it, to love all sides of you--the anger, the fear, the sadness... Then you can harness it. Come on. It’s OK.
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: But--
N: He stops. And looks at Kakashi like, “Fuck it. Let’s do it.” So he does. He focuses. A tear rolls down his cheek. The wind blows hard through the trees. The trees spark flames. But Kakashi does not react. To the licking flames around him. He just locks eyes with Naruto. And holds his gaze. And now, the balloon starts to spin. And Naruto starts to cry more. He watches it, focused. Kakashi smiles. As it spins there, suspended in the air. Kakashi holds out his hand. Naruto is thinking, feeling the pain. More tears now. The balloon rises into the air. Moves over to Kakashi’s hand. It’s amazing. Naruto’s moving things through the air with precision. And now, it falls onto Kakashi’s hand, and POPS. And Naruto crumples up in a heap, crying. Kakashi moves to touch his shoulder, hesitates. Says simply:
C: KAKASHI
D: Enough progress for one day.
N: Naruto wipes tears away. He looks up, to see his new mentor. Kakashi offers his hand. Naruto grabs it. Kakashi pulls him to his feet. And Kakashi, ever so gently, puts an arm on Naruto’s shoulder as they walk into the woods, back to the others.
S: EXT. CAMPFIRE - DAY
N: Naruto and Kakashi return to camp to find something shocking.
C: SASUKE
D: ‘Morning.
N: Sakura comes sleepily from her shelter of branches.
C: SAKURA
D: What’s going on?
C: SASUKE
D: I made everyone breakfast.
N: Everyone stares.
C: SAKURA
D: ...you what?
N: Sasuke says nothing, just sets a makeshift table.
C: NARUTO
D: Helpful Sasuke is scary.
C: SAKURA
D: I didn’t know you made kobachi.
E: checking out the meal
C: SASUKE
D: It’s a Uchiha speciality. So...
N: He swallows hard, clenching his perfect jaw, his piercing eyes sparkling with withheld tears...
C: SASUKE
D: ...you know. It’s hard for me.
E: CONT'D
N: Sakura and Sasuke lock eyes. She’s deeply moved. Kakashi gives Naruto a clap on the shoulder and sits.
C: KAKASHI
D: See? Feelings. Powerful stuff.
N: Naruto sits and shoves a whole pork bun in his mouth.
C: SASUKE
D: Are you-- just gonna--
C: NARUTO
D: Ivewaproblem?
E: mouth full of bun
N: Sasuke looks at Naruto for a long time. Then he smiles.
C: SASUKE
D: No. I’m glad you’re hungry.
N: The kids and their teacher eat, smile, make eye contact. It’s good food. And somehow, it’s the tiny final puzzle piece they needed to become a team. Music swells, taking us into a.... MONTAGE Sakura and Sasuke SPAR. Kakashi coaches. They wrap each other up, then push each other off. Even though it’s violent, it’s almost romantic. We PAN OFF THEM to Naruto. Standing there, stone-faced. The balloon spinning right in front of him. -TEAM 7 races each other to the top of trees and now running across the branches. Sasuke shoots a fire jutsu at Naruto clone, who leaps into the sky and corkscrews using a Jump Jutsu... -Sakura uses a healing jutsu on a wounded rabbit in the forest. --Sasuke using his Sharingan to analyze Naruto’s form and give adjustments. -Naruto spars with Kakashi. He’s improving. --Sakura passes her hand over Naruto’s body, bruised from sparring with Kakashi. She heals him. She breathes heavily, winded from the use of chakra. Naruto nods thank you. -Sasuke spars with Kakashi. He THROWS A FIRE JUTSU, followed by a FLYING KICK, and knocks Kakashi to the ground! He stands over Kakashi, smiles, REACHES HIS HAND TO PULL HIM UP... Kakashi takes it. -And finally, we see Naruto step out into the current, close his eyes, and focus. He tunes everything out. All sound and music disappears from our soundscape. He starts to rise onto the water -- but he still can’t quite do it. He falls, and is taken away by the current. He grabs onto a rock and pushes up to the shore, out of breath. But undaunted.
C: KAKASHI
D: OK! Let’s try this again!
E: O.S. prelap
S: EXT. FOREST - DAY
N: The waterfall test. Kakashi stands on the shore, book in hand, and peers over the pages at Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura, all in the water, fighting against the current. Sasuke and Sakura are walking on the water, but Naruto struggles still.
C: SASUKE
D: Naruto, focus!
C: NARUTO
D: I am focusing! Deal with your own shit before you start giving me notes, pretty boy!
C: SAKURA
D: Will you two stop!
N: Kakashi sighs, flipping pages.
C: NARUTO
D: Let’s take this outside!
C: SASUKE
D: We ARE outside!
N: Naruto swims to the shore. Sasuke follows him. When Sasuke steps onto the shore, Naruto shoots a FIREBALL at him. And Sasuke creates a water wall to defend it!
C: SAKURA
D: Guys! Seriously! This is ridiculous!
N: Kakashi finally gets fed up and walks over to them.
C: KAKASHI
D: ENOUGH !
N: Meanwhile, Naruto somehow appears by Kakashi’s side. As Kakashi takes one more step, and... IS HOISTED HIGH ABOVE THE GROUND INTO A TRAP Naruto simultaneously snatches the book right from his hands. He holds it up above his head. Team 7 looks up, smiling:
C: NARUTO
D: GOTCHA !
N: Kakashi looks at Naruto, then turns to see ANOTHER NARUTO standing in the water.
C: KAKASHI
D: A clone? Naruto?
C: NARUTO/NARUTO CLONE
D: Yep. Check us out!
N: As Naruto conjures 2 more clones. And a couple more...until...a full dozen.
C: KAKASHI
D: Oh no. One of you was too much.
N: The clones disappear as Team 7 celebrates! And Kakashi begrudgingly accepts defeat. He reaches into his pocket for a knife, cuts himself free, elegantly lands on the ground:
C: KAKASHI
D: Good one. You got me. Good acting too. Especially you, Sakura. You really surprised me with that performance.
E: CONT'D
C: SAKURA
D: This whole thing was my idea!
C: KAKASHI
D: But, seriously. Give the book back.
N: Naruto grabs it from Sakura, flips through it.
C: NARUTO 2
D: Just a second, Kakashi-sensei.
C: KAKASHI
D: I will set you on fire.
C: NARUTO
D: OK. OK.
S: EXT. NINJA ACADEMY CAMPUS
N: The giant doors to the academy swing open. Teams are sparring and practicing jutsu. A HUSH falls as Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke walk behind Kakashi. Dirty, bruised, intense. They stride across campus. All eyes on them.
C: INO
D: Sup, Forehead G--
N: A single glance from Sakura stops her mid-sentence.
S: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
N: A band plays. White tablecloths, glasses of champagne. Naruto glimpses his reflection in a lacquered wall. He’s in military formalwear, and looks awesome.
C: SASUKE
D: Are you checking yourself out?
E: O.S.
N: Naruto looks up at Sasuke, caught. But he decides to OWN IT.
C: NARUTO
D: Hells yes.
N: Sasuke sighs... but also poses just the TINIEST BIT behind Naruto. For a second they look like a boy band.
C: SAKURA
D: Yes, mom. I understand.
E: O.S. faintly overheard
N: They look up to see Sakura with HER PARENTS. Sakura’s parents are VERY proud. Both crying. Hugging her. Sakura makes eye contact with her teammates, smiles. And Sasuke and Naruto, the two orphan boys, wave back at her. For a moment the boys with no parents watch Sakura with hers.
C: SASUKE
D: Let’s go see if anyone new has crushes on us.
E: swatting Naruto’s arm
N: Meanwhile, KAKASHI lingers at the fringes. He realizes he’s drifted to a WALL OF PHOTOS. In one photo, YOUNG OROCHIMARU stares at the camera alongside his teammates Tsunade and Jiraiya...and his teacher Sarutobi. In another photo, YOUNG KAKACHI smiles alongside his teammates Obito and Rin...and his teacher, Minato Uzumaki.
C: SARUTOBI
D: You were Minato’s favorite student. And today you teach his son.
C: KAKASHI
D: Hokage.
E: quick bow
N: Now Sarutobi lands on the picture of himself and Orochimaru, and his wise face displays unmistakable grief.
C: SARUTOBI
D: I tried not to have a favorite student.
N: Young Orochimaru gazes at Sarutobi from the photo. QUICK FLASH OF: Orochimaru summoning the Nine-Tailed Fox, the flames, the destruction, the lost young man in the photograph grown up to become a monster. Kakashi can see what Sarutobi is going through. He offers:
C: KAKASHI
D: These kids have a way of getting under your skin, don’t they.
C: SARUTOBI
D: I know you got under Minato’s. You owe a lot to this place, Kakashi.
C: KAKASHI
D: You could probably say I owe everything to this place.
N: And just at that moment... Sarutobi senses that something is wrong in the world. It’s just a feeling--a dissonant note in the score. Sarutobi looks around the room to see: ... Ino flipping her hair deliberately in Sakura’s face ... Shino dropping a bug down Kiba’s back ... Naruto dancing with Hinata, (who dances VERY VERY shyly). The kids look excited, unaware of anything sinister brewing. But Sarutobi turns, gravely, to Kakashi.
C: SARUTOBI
D: If something happens during the exams... protect this place.
C: KAKASHI
D: ...What could happen?
N: Kakashi looks around the room, trying to see what Sarutobi saw, or didn’t see. Just then they’re interrupted by:
C: KABUTO
D: Hokage, let me congratulate you.
N: Kakashi watches Kabuto pay his respects to Sarutobi. Something about Kabuto pings Kakashi’s suspicion.
S: EXT. HOKAGE SQUARE - DAY
N: Bright daylight. Bleachers have been erected in Hokage Square, food sellers are out with carts and tents. Everyone’s buzzing with excitement. Parents, teachers, even reporters with camera crews. All here to watch the Chunin Trials. OVER BY THE STUDENTS The students stand in formation, some distance from the milling crowds, as Anko Mitarashi paces in front of them.
C: ANKO
D: I wish I could say you looked ready. Is anyone ready?
C: NARUTO
D: I’m ready.
C: ANKO
D: Is anyone ever ready to take their life, and the lives of their teammates, into their own fragile human hands? What are hands, anyway? What even IS a jutsu?
E: ignoring him
N: Naruto faintly hears a cheer from the bleachers:
C: IRUKA
D: Wooo!!! Go Naruto!!!! Go Team 7!!!
N: Naruto grins and waves at Iruka. IN THE BLEACHERS
C: KAKASHI
D: He’s a good kid, Iruka-san. You raised him well.
C: IRUKA
D: And you have trained him well, Kakashi-san.
N: They share a moment. A smile between old friends.
S: INT. CHUNIN ZONE - TEAM 7 STARTING POSITION, DAY
N: Kakashi watches Team 7 pull on identifying armbands, nervous and jittery for the competition to begin.
C: SAKURA
D: Naruto, Sasuke and I worked out a special password. In case anyone tries to clone us.
C: NARUTO
D: OK. What is it?
C: SASUKE
D: “A ninja waits until the time is right/when the enemy is asleep and lowers his guard/when his weapons lie forgotten in the darkness of the night/that's the moment for a ninja to strike.”
C: NARUTO
D: More of a pass-poem, but OK. Got it.
C: KAKASHI
D: Team...
N: He wants to say something, but is clearly uncomfortable with emotion:
C: KAKASHI
D: I just want to say that...
E: CONT'D
N: A long beat.
C: KAKASHI
D: You taught me a lot.
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: Whoa.
C: SASUKE
D: That’s really nice, Kakashi-sensei.
N: Sakura smiles, clasps his hand. The moment is quiet, intimate.
C: KAKASHI
D: And now...DESTROY YOUR ENEMIES!
C: NARUTO
D: Wut wuuuuuuuuut
N: They deploy with a wild cry, vanishing into the streets. But something troubles Kakashi. He looks around, anxious. He hears that same off-note in the score. Something’s coming.
S: EXT. CHUNIN ZONE - DAY
N: Tilt down from the SUNBURST, exploding in the sky. To find Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura, moving cagily out of the starting circle. They quickly move to some buildings, scale the fire escapes. They look down, scan the neighborhood. Their eyes narrow, as they land on... Team 10... Walking toward a ryokan-esque structure. Sasuke and Naruto look to Sakura... She nods.
S: INT. RYOKAN STRUCTURE - DAY
N: Sliding doors. Tatami mats. Team 10 is split up in the structure. Ino holds a scroll tight. They are lying in wait. Meanwhile, Sakura, Sasuke and Naruto are pressed against the wall. Listening intently... Choji is about to step into the next room. Ino sees something, pulls him out of the way, but not before... A SECRET PANEL IN THE FLOOR SLIDES AWAY. Revealing a pit of spikes! Choji looks down, horrified. That was close. Now, he steps back, looks up... To see... The walls are ENGULFED IN FLAME. Naruto stands behind them,
T: silhouetted, executing his fire jutsu.
C: INO
D: It’s Team 7! It’s a trap! Bail!
N: They step outside, and are greeted with a WATER WALL. On the other side, Naruto executes the jutsu, while Sasuke steps through the water and HURLS FIREBALLS at Team 10. Knocking Ino down... Sakura grabs the scroll, and...
C: SAKURA
D: Thank you, girlfriend! Guys! Run! Run!
E: to her teammates
N: Now, Team 7 is on the move. They pass the ball back and
T: forth, executing perfect scroll movement.
N: A SPOTTER on the rooftop yells like a platoon commander:
C: ROOFTOP SPOTTER
D: Team 7 on the move!
S: EXT. KONOHA SKYLINE - DAY
N: Spotters on different rooftops repeat the cry: “Team 7 on the move!” carrying the news back to...
S: EXT. HOKAGE SQUARE - DAY
N: ...the bleachers, where the spectators hang on every word. They’re tracking the game through the first-hand reports of the spotters, the scoreboard, and whatever mayhem they can glimpse in the city’s cordoned-off exam zone. But Kakashi notices Kabuto slipping away from the crowd. Kakashi slips out of his seat to follow. Iruka does a double-take when he notices Kakashi gone.
S: EXT. CORDONED-OFF STREETS - DAY
N: In the Exam Zone, the quiet, cordoned-off streets look empty-- Until we realize: Sakura, Sasuke and Naruto are moving swiftly up the street before our eyes, employing camouflage, passing the scroll between them. Naruto tosses the scroll to Sasuke, who runs up ahead... But a MIST CLOSES IN... Naruto slows down. He scans his surroundings. But now, and so quickly, it is only GRAY.
C: NARUTO
D: Guys?
S: EXT. TOP OF THE WALL - CONTINUOUS
C: ROOFTOP SPOTTER
D: WeaTHER!
N: The cry is repeated over the rooftops.
S: EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY
N: Sarutobi hears the repeated cry, sees the mist in the streets. He rises from his seat.
C: ANKO
D: That’s not part of the exam. LORD HOKAGE! Something’s wrong!
S: EXT. FOUNTAIN - DAY
N: Sasuke and Sakura whirl in the mist.
C: SAKURA
D: Where’s Naruto?
C: NARUTO
D: I got lost for a second. Sorry.
E: emerging from the mist
C: SAKURA
D: Quick. We’re 2 clicks from the center. We gotta--
C: SASUKE
D: Wait! Wait. How do we know this is the real Naruto?
C: SAKURA
D: You’re right. What’s the password?
C: NARUTO
D: “A ninja waits until the time is right/when the enemy is asleep and lowers his guard/when his weapons lie forgotten in the darkness of the night/that's the moment...” ”...when...the time is right.”
E: forgetting the end
N: A beat. And then: SASUKE PUNCHES NARUTO IN THE FACE.
C: SAKURA
D: He almost got it!
C: SASUKE
D: The real Naruto wouldn’t have made it that far.
N: And now Naruto, or whoever it is, starts to LAUGH. Laugh and DISTURBINGLY CHANGE SHAPE, stretching and warping before Sakura and Sasuke’s eyes--
S: EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY
N: Kakashi trails Kabuto down the quiet streets, losing him around a corner. The streets are empty-- Everyone’s watching the trials.
S: EXT. ACADEMY GATES - DAY
N: Kakashi follows Kabuto... to the GATES OF THE ACADEMY. Four guards are opening the gate for him, operating the two giant wheels on either side. Kakashi shouts from thirty feet away:
C: KAKASHI
D: KABUTO!
N: Kabuto turns back to see Kakashi. His expression is complex-- is he... regretful? But then he just says, simply:
C: KABUTO
D: He’ll kill me if I disobey. It’s you or me.
C: KAKASHI
D: Close the gates!
E: to the guards
N: But Kabuto does that Corporeal Manipulation Jutsu, freezing the guards where they stand. Now Kakashi turns to see: Kidomaru, Tayuya, Sakon, Jirobo, and an ARMY of other Fallen Ninja from the occupied bar, emerging from the sidestreets, headed towards the Academy. He palms his kunai, and stands alone before the open gates. It’s KAKASHI VERSUS AN ARMY.
C: KAKASHI
D: You wanna do this again?
E: CONT'D mainly to Kidomaru
N: Kidomaru RUSHES Kakashi, who dodges. Kakashi is SO FAST. But Kidomaru has four extra hands to do jutsu with. And now, Kidomaru performs Orochimaru’s CHAKRA-ROBBING JUTSU. Kakashi dives out of the sightline of Kidomaru’s raised hand. The jutsu hits one of the frozen guards, who begins to CONVULSE as Kidomaru drains her chakra--
C: KIDOMARU
D: This time we know some new tricks.
N: Kakashi realizes in horror what’s happening. Kakashi kicks Kidomaru’s hand out of the way and the guard drops to the ground...then GETS TO HER FEET, awakened by the attack. Now Kakashi is RUSHED by the gang. Jirobo bearhugs him, but he manages to kick Tayuya in the face with his arms pinned. The other Fallen Ninja move towards the open gate. Kakashi shouts at the awakened guard:
C: KAKASHI
D: CLOSE THE GATE!!
S: EXT. FOUNTAIN - DAY
N: Sasuke and Sakura ready their attacks, watching in horror as Naruto’s joints creak and rearrange before their eyes, until-- The transformation is complete. Orochimaru stands before them. Sakura’s eyes go wide. Sasuke activates his sharingan, looking for the branching paths emanating from Orochimaru... but he sees NOTHING.
C: SASUKE
D: Get Sarutobi.
E: to Sakura
C: SAKURA
D: We have to stop him.
E: raising her fists
N: But then Sasuke looks at Sakura with an expression she has never seen on his face: pure terror. Seeing how scared he is makes her scared. Without another word, she RUNS.
S: EXT. ACADAMY GATES - DAY
N: The lone guard tries to close the gates single-handed as Kakashi is ABSOLUTLEY MOBBED, everyone attacking him at once, the OPPOSITE of proper kung-fu movie etiquette. He finally FLIPS JIROBO INTO TAYUYA, clearing a tiny bit of space. He whirls in a circle of foes. Sakon and Ukon get a wicked look in their eyes and BLAST A FIREBALL past Kakashi--
C: KAKASHI
D: NO!
N: Where it HITS the guard who’s trying to close the gate. Tayuya whips out that BLOW GUN she used to kill the rat earlier. It turns out it’s a FLUTE. She plays demonic music-- Now, her Doki (three OGRE-LIKE creatures) emerge from the city. She looks at them:
C: TAYUYA
D: Good boys.
N: There’s a BANG and everyone looks to the sky--the guard who was trying to open the gate has just blasted a fireball straight into the sky. Then she COLLAPSES.
S: EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY
N: Sarutobi whirls to see the fireball the guard shot up.
C: SARUTOBI CIVILAINS, DISPERSE.
D: SHINOBI, WITH ME.
N: EVERYONE’s on their feet. The square is PACKED with swirling, rushing bodies--
C: ROOFTOP SPOTTERS
D: Sound the alarm!
N: The other spotters repeat the cry.
S: EXT. CHUNIN ZONE - DAY
N: Throughout the Chunin Zone the students hear the cry. They run back towards the Academy.
S: EXT. MIST - DAY
N: Naruto faintly hears: “sound the alarm!” But he’s dizzy. His eyes burn. He starts to cough.
S: EXT. FOUNTAIN - DAY
N: Orochimaru moves to Sasuke:
C: OROCHIMARU
D: You’re afraid.
C: SASUKE
D: I’m not afraid. I just know how this ends.
N: And OROCHIMARU STARTS HIS DIABOLICAL JUTSU. Sasuke SCREAMS.
S: EXT. STREETS OF KONOHA - DAY
N: Sarutobi strides down the street, the Shinobi rushing all around him, everyone racing towards the school. Instructor Asuma hands Sarutobi his GAUNTLETS and Sarutobi dons them without breaking stride. SFX: A THUNDERCLAP. THE RAIN COMES DOWN.
S: EXT. FOUNTAIN - DAY
N: Orochimaru is DRAINING SASUKE’S POWER.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: I hate to wipe out the last member of the Uchiha clan. Except... you’re not the last member of the Uchiha clan, are you.
N: Sasuke’s eyes widen, compounding his misery. Orochimaru PROJECTS THE MEMORIES FROM SASUKE’S BRAIN onto the stone walls around them, like movies:
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Your big brother. He’s the one who killed them all.
E: CONT'D
N: QUICK GLIMPSES OF: - Sasuke’s whole village, slain, except his older brother who stands over their bodies. - More innocent times, the two boys growing up together...
S: EXT. STREETS OF KONOHA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: ...And earlier still, one little boy carrying another, running barefoot as the Nine-Tailed Fox attacks. The young one (2), is Sasuke. The older one (7), his brother. BACK TO: Sasuke’s screams turn defiant. Orochimaru, suddenly, RELEASES him.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: What if we find him together.
C: SASUKE
D: WHAT?
C: OROCHIMARU
D: I don’t love the idea of you dying. You could join me instead. I can help you find your brother and avenge what he did.
N: Sasuke shakes, in pain, in conflict.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: This is what you were afraid of, isn’t it. You were afraid you might say yes.
E: CONT'D
N: You can see in Sasuke’s eyes how much he wants revenge.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: You can stand here and die or you can live, and have your revenge.
E: CONT'D
C: SASUKE
D: Just go back to killing me.
N: So Orochimaru does.
S: EXT. ACADEMY GATES - DAY
N: Now, the throng of Shinobi MEETS AND CLASHES with the army of Fallen Ninja. Sarutobi LAYS INTO the first Fallen he sees, dropping him with a knee to the gut--a surprisingly expedient attack for such a dignified leader-- HEADMISTRESS KURENAI squares off with Sakon and Ukon, the conjoined twins-- KIDOMARU uses Orochimaru’s jutsu to drain a Shinobi’s chakra-- It’s a full-on Gangs Of New York Style STREET WAR.
S: EXT. STREETS OF KONOHA - DAY
N: Sakura comes up alongside Ino as they race to the school.
C: INO
D: Do you know what’s going on?
E: as they run
C: SAKURA
D: Someone ambushed us. Orochimaru. I have to find the Hokage.
E: out of breath
S: EXT. MIST - DAY
N: Through the mist, over the pounding of the rain, Naruto finally hears one thing: SASUKE SCREAMING.
S: EXT. FOUNTAIN - DAY
N: Sasuke’s on his knees. Rain pours down.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: This can stop at any time.
N: Sasuke gets shakily to his feet.
C: SASUKE
D: No, it can’t.
E: through gritted teeth
N: Orochimaru prepares to drain the last of Sasuke’s energy-- When Naruto LEAPS FROM THE SHADOWS AND CONNECTS HIS FOOT TO SASUKE’S FACE!
C: SASUKE
D: WHAT THE FUCK--
E: CONT'D
N: Naruto straddles Sasuke and starts punching him.
C: NARUTO
D: The real Sasuke would never give up! He would stand by his teammates no matter the odds! He’s one of the bravest, most loyal people I’ve ever known!
C: SASUKE
D: Naruto... It’s me. I promise.
C: NARUTO
D: Then why are you kneeling to that, that--?
N: He turns to see the cloaked, hooded figure Orochimaru, growing in stature, his reptilian eyes shimmering gold... AND NARUTO HAS NEVER BEEN SO TERRIFIED IN ALL HIS LIFE.
C: NARUTO
D: You. It’s you...
E: CONT'D
N: Orochimaru executes a jutsu sending a BLACK MIST creeping toward our heroes... Every living thing it touches, wilting and dying unnaturally. Sasuke conjures a wall of water, protecting himself and Naruto. Orochimaru stares at Sasuke like he just witnessed something beautiful. With a wave of his hand, the black mists disappear... And he SHOOTS AN ELECTRIC BLUE LINE OF ENERGY TOWARD SASUKE, wrapping him up in this pulsing lasso.
C: NARUTO
D: No!
E: CONT'D
N: Orochimaru looks at Naruto. They lock eyes for the first time. He smiles...
S: EXT. GATES OF THE ACADEMY - DAY
N: Ino and Sakura turn the corner to see the WAR IN THE STREETS.
C: INO
D: There!
E: spotting Sarutobi
N: But before Sakura can run to Sarutobi--
C: INO
D: You’re an amazing ninja. I’ve just been distracting you with this dumb rivalry because I know you’re really competitive.
E: CONT'D
N: Sakura’s too out of breath to say anything, but she nods with great sincerity, and runs off.
C: JIROBO
D: Earth release jutsu!
N: Jirobo hurls a mighty stone at Ino, knocking her to the ground, but in a split-second she’s back on her feet, in a fighting stance.
C: INO
D: Bring it!
N: They fly at each other, as-- OVER BY SARUTOBI
C: SAKURA
D: Hokage!
N: Sarutobi turns to see Sakura doubled over, out of breath. He surveys the unfolding war, the Academy gates still open--
C: SAKURA
D: Lord Hokage--I believe we need you more.
E: CONT'D
N: And without another word, he follows her.
S: INT. CHUNIN ZONE - CONTINUOUS
N: Orochimaru moves to Naruto, when someone steps from the mist-- It’s IRUKA.
C: IRUKA
D: Touch him and you’ll regret it.
C: NARUTO
D: Iruka!
N: Iruka propels a fleet of shuriken at Orochimaru, who dodges. Orochimaru brandishes a CHAKRA BLADE, charges it up...
C: NARUTO
D: NO!
E: CONT'D
N: ..and STRIKES IRUKA DOWN. And now, the FIRE FOX WITHIN NARUTO GLOWS.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: What’s that?
C: NARUTO
D: What? No, it’s nothing!
N: Orochimaru starts to laugh. It’s terrifying.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: OF COURSE! The orphan idiot. You’re the one they stuffed the fox in.
C: NARUTO
D: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: I really think you do.
N: Orochimaru starts to do his jutsu, draining Naruto’s chakra-- And the fox grows greater and greater.
C: NARUTO
D: Stop! Please stop!
N: Naruto’s unable to move as Orochimaru feeds off him, draining his chakra, glowing with his power...
C: IRUKA
D: Get. Away. From. Him.
N: Orochimaru looks between Naruto and Iruka, and we can see a cruel idea form. He smiles. It’s terrible when he smiles. He raises his left hand, and blasts all of Naruto’s chakra directly at Iruka. Naruto’s whole world goes quiet. He runs to Iruka, who spills into his arms, his whole midsection bloody and burned.
C: NARUTO
D: Iruka-san??
N: Orochimaru comes to stand over them.
C: NARUTO
D: What’d you do?
E: CONT'D
C: OROCHIMARU
D: I didn’t do anything. You did this.
C: NARUTO
D: No...
C: OROCHIMARU
D: The Nine Tails is older than me. Older than Konoha. As old as the land itself. You should have learned to control it.
N: Orochimaru lifts his hands to tear the Nine-Tails out--
C: SARUTOBI
D: Orochimaru, stop it NOW.
N: --and turns to see Sarutobi, his gauntlets glinting. Sakura arrives with him, and runs to Sasuke’s side.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Sensei.
C: SARUTOBI
D: Orochimaru.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: You should have killed me when you had the chance.
N: Orochimaru sends a WAVE OF DARK ENERGY towards Sarutobi, who performs a jutsu that FREEZES IT IN THE AIR, the two great ninja struggling for dominance--
C: SARUTOBI
E: with tears in his eyes
C: No, I shouldn’t have.
D: I’m your teacher. And you should have learned.
N: Sarutobi HEAVES the frozen energy into a building, which it UTTERLY consumes.
C: SARUTOBI
D: GO! Take Naruto somewhere safe!
E: CONT'D
C: SASUKE
D: Follow me!
C: SAKURA
D: Where are we going?
N: Team 7 disappears into the sidestreets, supporting Iruka.
S: INT. EMPTY GREAT HALL - DAY
N: Sasuke and Sakura burst into a vacated GREAT HALL. Naruto supports Iruka, carrying him into the next room.
C: SAKURA
D: Sasuke? What is this place.
C: SASUKE
D: Uchiha Hall. It’s where--it’s where my brother killed our parents.
N: Sakura looks at Sasuke, heart breaking for him.
S: INT. SASUKE’S BEDROOM - DAY
N: In Sasuke’s looming bedroom, Naruto eases Iruka onto the bed. Iruka is in bad shape.
C: NARUTO
D: Iruka-san... Please. Don’t go. Please.
S: EXT. ACADEMY GATES - DAY
N: Headmistress Kurenai, Instructor Asuma, Anko Mitarashi, ALL are clashing with the Fallen Ninja.
C: KAKASHI
D: REPEL THEM PAST THE GATE!
N: Choji comes out of nowhere... And ROLLS RIGHT INTO one of the Fallen. The students are in the fight, too!
C: KAKASHI
D: I see why they call you the bomb.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. FOUNTAIN - DAY
N: Sarutobi and Orochimaru FIGHT.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: What are you dying for, old teacher? You know you can’t beat me.
C: SARUTOBI
D: I am the Hokage of this city. And everyone in this city is my family.
S: EXT. GATES OF THE ACADEMY - DAY
N: Music rises as: Working together, Anko and Asuma finally CLOSE THE GATE, splitting the fight in two.
C: SARUTOBI
D: I’ve made mistakes. More than I can count. But I will NEVER turn my back on them.
E: V.O.
N: And with that the mighty gates are closed, though the fight rages inside and out. A cry goes up--”the gates are closed!” Kakashi looks up to the skyline. A puff of smoke still hangs from the explosion of Naruto’s Nine-Tails Energy.
C: KAKASHI
D: Stay out of the fight, kid...
S: EXT. ACADEMY COURTYARD - DAY
N: KABUTO has managed to be INSIDE the gates as they close. He sees his chance to disappear into the Academy campus-- When a NEEDLE OF WATER hits him in the neck like a dart. He falls flat on his face, revealing--shy little Hinata!!! Hinata pokes Kabuto with a toe. He doesn’t move.
C: HINATA
D: Ho boy.
S: INT. SASUKE’S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Naruto looks down at the sigil on his belly. It pulses orange beneath his shirt.
C: IRUKA
D: Naruto...
E: weakly
C: NARUTO
D: What?? What?
N: But there’s no reply. Iruka is fading fast.
C: NARUTO
D: Iruka-san!
E: CONT'D
N: Naruto knows: this is his last chance to say it.
C: NARUTO
D: I love you.
E: CONT'D
N: Iruka’s eyes flutter open.
C: IRUKA
D: I love you too, Naruto. And your parents loved you.
C: NARUTO
D: Why’d they even have me? I’m just... just cursed. I destroy everything.
C: IRUKA
D: Don’t say that.
N: Iruka summons his breath, every word costing him now.
C: IRUKA
D: Your mother was the keeper of the Nine Tails before you.
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: What... Really?
S: EXT. JINCHURICHI TEMPLE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
N: As before, LITTLE KUSHINA is led by adults in ceremonial attire to some kind of temple. She stops in her tracks.
C: LITTLE KUSHINA
D: I don’t wanna go in!
N: Now one of the adults, MITO UZUMAKI (80s), leans over her.
C: MITO
D: There’s nothing to be afraid of. See?
N: Mito opens her robe... to reveal that MITO bears the sigil of the NINE-TAILS ON HER STOMACH.
C: MITO
D: I was the keeper of the Nine-Tails my whole life. Now it’s your turn.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. MOMENTS THROUGHOUT TIME (FLASHBACK)
N: Minato and Kushina grow alongside each other, train alongside each other, fall in love. Only this time, we get a good view of Kushina’s stomach: NOW, KUSHINA BEARS THE SIGIL.
C: IRUKA
D: It lived inside her all her life. She harnessed it with grace.
E: V.O.
S: INT. MATERNITY ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
C: IRUKA
D: But Orochimaru drew it out of her on the night you were born.
E: V.O.
N: Kushina is IN CHILDBIRTH, SCREAMING. Her SIGIL GLOWS, then FADES. The Nine-Tailed Fox is loose.
S: EXT. BARRICADE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: His every step heavy with destiny, Minato comes to stand alongside Kushina. He looks up at the fox.
C: MINATO
D: Are you ready?
E: to Kushina
C: KUSHINA NO! YOU IDIOT. No.
D: We were supposed to get old together.
C: MINATO
D: I am so sorry, my love.
N: This time, we hear what Minato says NEXT:
C: MINATO
D: But Naruto will.
E: CONT'D
N: Kushina cries freely. But a peace comes over her.
C: KUSHINA
D: I’m ready.
N: Minato summons the fox’s yin energy into himself--
C: MINATO
D: NOW!
N: Kushina drops the chains, and they RUN--
S: EXT. BARRICADE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: Kushina and Minato CHARGE into the maternity cabin. Kushina cradles her baby, kisses his head, looks in his eyes. As before, baby Naruto calms under his mom’s gaze. But now, for the first time, we see what baby Naruto sees: His mom’s face. Dirty. Bloodied. Hair matted with sweat. She’s crying... and she’s smiling. For all that the world is ending around her... she has hope.
C: IRUKA
D: She didn’t give you this power to punish you. She did it because she loved you... and she trusted you.
E: V.O.
N: Kushina leans over her only child, performing the jutsu that seals the 9 Tails in his tiny body... BACK TO SCENE: ...But the story doesn’t continue. Because Iruka is dead.
C: NARUTO
D: Iruka-san? IRUKA-SAN?
E: V.O.
N: Naruto cries, no stopping it now. He looks around. He’s all alone. He has to decide what to do.
S: EXT. FOUNTAIN - DAY
N: Orochimaru and Sarutobi are deep in combat when: Both their gazes lift in unison. Above the treetops outside of town, the telltale flame of the Nine Tailed Fox. Orochimaru lets Sarutobi drop to the ground.
S: EXT. TREETOPS OUTSIDE THE CITY - DAY
N: Naruto runs across treetops. Sakura and Sasuke appear by his side...
C: NARUTO
D: GET OUT OF HERE!
C: SAKURA
D: What are you doing?
C: NARUTO
D: Uh, luring the big bad guy very far away from where we go to school?
C: SAKURA
D: And then what?
C: NARUTO
D: I didn’t really get much past that.
C: SASUKE
D: Where is he?
N: The GIANT COWLED FIGURE of Orochimaru rises into the trees.
C: NARUTO
D: Guys! I got this! This is my fight!
C: SAKURA
D: Naruto, we are NOT leaving you.
N: They all run, from treetop to treetop. Orochimaru is close behind HURLING BOLTS OF ENERGY their way. They dodge and leap until...
C: NARUTO
D: Down there. GO!
N: They land in a clearing that borders a vast river. They roll into a ditch and take cover behind some brush. A long quiet beat.
C: SAKURA
D: It’s so quiet...
N: It’s true. There is nothing but their breath and the wind. And now, Naruto dares peer his head over the edge of the ditch, to see... OROCHIMARU HAS TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A GIANT SNAKE Naruto ducks his head back down, turns to his teammates:
C: NARUTO
D: Did you know he can turn into a giant snake?
E: voice hoarse
N: Sakura peers over now. Sees the snake. Takes a deep breath.
C: SAKURA
D: Go out there, get his attention. Sasuke and I will flank and form an energy wall. Naruto, you got this.
E: beat
C: NARUTO
D: No I don’t think I got this.
N: Sakura suddenly kisses him, stunning him and Sasuke. She pulls away.
C: SAKURA
D: You do.
N: Naruto is dumbstruck. He simply nods and heads out with nothing to say, perhaps for the first time in his life. A long beat between Sasuke and Sakura:
C: SASUKE
D: So you like... him?
C: SAKURA
D: YOU IDIOT, I LIKE YOU. I just had to get him out of his head.
N: He looks at her in surprise. She grabs his hand, squeezes it.
C: SASUKE
D: How do I know you’re not just trying to get me out of my head?
N: She smiles at him.
C: SAKURA
D: I guess you don’t.
N: MEANWHILE, NARUTO... Steps out of cover. He’s scared. But he speaks.
C: NARUTO
D: Orochimaru! Leave Konoha alone.
N: Naruto sounds, maybe, just a little, like Minato.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: You don’t mind if I take your head first, do you? Infinite Darkness Jutsu..
N: The sky goes dark above them. Utter black descends. Sasuke looks at Sakura, nods... And leaps out of the ditch, HURLING FIREBALLS THAT STROBE THROUGH THE NIGHT SKY. Orochimaru SPITS VENOM at Sakura, who doubles over, blinded.
C: SAKURA
D: Arrrgh!
N: Naruto leaps onto him with his chakra blade and SLITS the snake’s throat. The snake withdraws onto the water, and changes form... Sasuke is injured. Sakura runs to the water, splashes it into her eyes, cleaning the poison out. And she runs over to Sasuke, exercising a healing jutsu. She doubles over, winded from chakra exhaustion. Orochimaru seizes the opportunity, and FIRES A BALL OF ENERGY TOWARD HER, HITTING HER!
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Meet your end.
N: She is on the ground, knocked back. He moves toward her... Naruto’s too far. He sees Sakura, vulnerable. Fox-fire rises within him:
C: NARUTO
D: NO!
N: Orochimaru looks at Naruto, sees the Nine-Tails threatening to come out.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: YES!!!!
N: Now, Sakura looks up to Orochimaru, with fury in her eyes, surprises him with a jutsu that tears open wounds in his flesh. And Sasuke looks up at her:
C: SASUKE
D: What the hell was that?
E: impressed
C: SAKURA
D: Healing jutsu!
C: SASUKE
D: What?
C: SAKURA
D: Backwards.
E: looking dead at Sasuke
C: SASUKE
D: ...That’s incredible.
N: Chakra swirls around Orochimaru like electric coils. He wraps Sasuke and Sakura in it and holds them aloft as he moves onto the water. Naruto’s eyes widen; his friends are in danger.
C: NARUTO
D: Put them down! This is about us!
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Sure thing.
N: Orochimaru HURLS THEM TO THE SHORE. They hit trees, land with a thud. Naruto looks at them, fox-fire glowing within him. He moves to the water. Alone...
C: SAKURA
D: Naruto, no! We’re a team.
N: He turns back to Sakura:
C: NARUTO
D: Trust me, Sakura.
C: SAKURA
D: Naruto!? What are you going to do?
C: NARUTO
D: I’m gonna, you know, blow myself up. And take him with me. Sacrifice myself. Like my parents did. That’s why I’m here. I know that now. This is my destiny.
E: shrugs
N: Sakura has tears in her eyes. And Naruto is about to step out, when:
C: SAKURA
D: NARUTO! WAIT! DON’T!
N: Sakura conjures a genjutsu:
C: SAKURA
D: Thought transfer jutsu!
E: CONT'D
N: Naruto closes his eyes. Receives it.
C: NARUTO
D: Sakura! You’re a genius!
C: OROCHIMARU
D: COME OUT AND FIGHT.
N: The world shakes around Naruto. The soundscape booms with destruction. He tunes it all out. And tries again. He takes his first steps onto the river. Finally, and for the first time, HE CAN WALK ON WATER. He stands strong. In the face of Orochimaru’s blasting raw power toward him. He creates a forcefield around himself and strides toward them.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Your parents would be so disappointed in you...
E: CONT'D
N: Naruto stops in his tracks, water rippling beneath his feet.
C: NARUTO
D: You knew them?
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Of course I did. They never imagined... This. They wanted a warrior. Like them. But you’re nothing like them, are you. You’re just a punk kid and that’s all you’ll ever be. They’d be ashamed to look at you.
E: sizing him up beat
C: NARUTO
D: That’s not true.
E: not so sure
N: The fire of the fox dances in his eyes.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: Oh, but it is... Come, Naruto. Let it out.
E: beat
N: MEANWHILE, ON THE SHORE... Sasuke and Sakura turn to each other...
C: SAKURA
D: Naruto!!!!
N: Sakura gets his attention, EXECUTES SOME HAND MOVEMENTS, ABOUT TO LAUNCH INTO A JUTSU WHEN.. ..it happens... ...the light within Naruto flickers white hot... ...and Naruto loses control of the Nine-Tails... ...his body turning to ash and falling away.
C: SAKURA
D: NO!!!!!!
E: CONT'D
N: The demon bursts forth scattering his remains: a column of raw energy surrounded by flickering tails of flame. Orochimaru looks at the demon in awe and joy. It’s an incredible, terrible sight: the monster freed, expanding rapidly, towering above him. He raises his hands to draw in its power... ...and then gasps in pain, confusion on his face. Looking down, he sees Sasuke’s blade protruding through his stomach. THE NINE TAILS WAS JUST A GENJUTSU PERFORMED BY SAKURA! While Orochimaru was entranced by it, Sasuke snuck up on him and pierced his heart with his blade!
C: SASUKE
D: Fooled by an illusion?
C: NARUTO
D: Here comes reality.
N: He seizes Orochimaru, power CRACKLING as he forces energy into him, leaving him choking, trying to pull away.
C: NARUTO
D: All that stuff you said? About me being a punk? I know that already, that’s fine.
E: CONT'D
N: On the edge of control, his skin lit with power from the inside out, lines of fire like fox whiskers sear through his face as if they were cracks to the light within.
C: OROCHIMARU
D: STOP! STOP!
N: Sasuke begins a jutsu as Sakura raises her own blade.
C: SAKURA
D: NOW!
N: Naruto’s energy surges and Sasuke strikes, delivering the massive bolt of lightning as Sakura buries the sword in Orochimaru’s chest. SCREAMING, Orochimaru burns from the inside out, and his stolen power erupts in a white-hot explosion.
C: NARUTO
D: But don’t ever talk shit about my parents.
N: Orochimaru falls to the ground. Naruto looks to Sasuke. Sasuke looks to Sakura. Is it over? Did they really do it? Naruto wobbles on his feet, and PASSES OUT. TO BLACK. FLUTTERING LIGHTS AND VOICES IN THE BLACKNESS... “They’re here!” “Get them stabilized!” “Where’s the Hokage?” And then one voice in particular comes into focus. It’s Kakashi, reading from a book.
C: KAKASHI
D: ...and that’s what perplexed Riko: if she took the internship, she’d become the world’s greatest ninja, but could she fight the distraction of the sensei’s hunky son?
E: V.O.
S: INT. INFIRMARY - DAY
N: Naruto’s eyes flutter open. He’s in the infirmary.
C: NARUTO
D: Kakashi-sensei?
N: Kakashi looks up from his book. He smiles, in his way.
C: KAKASHI
D: Welcome back. I was just reading to you.
C: NARUTO
D: ...from what?
N: Kakashi shows him the cover: it’s NOT the steamy romance, it’s about a young ninja finding her way in life and love. Naruto lies back in bed, relieved.
C: NARUTO
D: Is everyone okay?
E: CONT'D
C: KAKASHI
D: Except...
E: nods
C: NARUTO
D: ...except for Iruka.
C: KAKASHI
D: He was so proud of you, Naruto.
C: NARUTO
D: He told me some things... before he died.
C: KAKASHI
D: I’m glad.
C: NARUTO
D: I didn’t take your instructions. I didn’t stay out of sight.
C: KAKASHI
D: You’re not good at instructions.
N: Naruto painfully sits up.
C: KAKASHI
D: Ready to go see the others?
E: CONT'D
N: Naruto gets out of bed. But he stops in the doorway.
C: KAKASHI
D: You scared to go out there?
E: CONT'D
C: NARUTO
D: Pshh! No.
C: KAKASHI
D: Then what are you waiting for?
N: Naruto looks at Kakashi, full of emotion.
C: NARUTO
D: Everyone saw the Nine-Tailed Fox. What if they look at me different?
N: Kakashi doesn’t have an answer, and he doesn’t lie.
C: KAKASHI
D: You can hide if you want to.
E: shrugging
N: Naruto takes a deep breath.
C: NARUTO
D: That’s not my style.
S: INT. INFIRMARY ATRIUM - DAY
N: No sound, just music. Naruto, in his hospital smock, appears in the doorway of the infirmary atrium. Sakura and Sasuke are here, in hospital smocks as well. Sasuke is still hooked up to some IVs. Their faces light up when they see Naruto. They rise. Sakura and Naruto hug. Sasuke offers a fist bump. Naruto hugs him instead. Their wires get tangled up. They drag Kakashi into the hug.
S: EXT. ACADEMY - DAY
N: Cheers. In front of a crumbling wall, a Graduation Ceremony.
C: HEADMISTRESS KURENAI Hold--everyone--HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE
D: until the whole team has graduated. Team Seven, under Kakashi Hatake.
N: Kakashi stands to name his students one by one.
C: KAKASHI
D: Sakura Haruno.
N: Sakura bows to Kakashi and walks to Sarutobi. Sarutobi is on crutches from his bout with Orochimaru. He ties a Shinobi headband around Sakura’s head.
C: SARUTOBI
D: For your leadership, and your strategy.
C: SAKURA
D: Thank you, Lord Hokage.
C: KAKASHI
D: Sasuke Uchiha.
N: Sasuke walks to Sarutobi, who ties his headband.
C: SARUTOBI
D: For allowing your heart to be warm.
C: SASUKE
D: Thank you, Lord Hokage.
C: KAKASHI
D: Naruto Uzumaki.
N: Kakashi gives Naruto a warm look as he passes to stand before Sarutobi.
C: SARUTOBI
D: For being exactly as you are.
N: Naruto smiles, (and boy is he beautiful when he smiles), because for the first time, being himself doesn’t sound like a bad thing.
C: NARUTO
D: Thanks, Lord.
N: The audience erupts. Sakura grabs her teammate’s hands and holds them high. Sasuke smiles despite himself. And we hear a familiar VOICE:
C: TEACHER
D: Raise your hand if you’ve heard the story of the Nine-Tailed Fox.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. HOKAGE SQUARE - SUNSET
N: That same TEACHER is teaching the next batch of kids.
C: TEACHER
D: Tamaki, you know the story? Is it a sad story or a happy story?
C: TAMAKI
D: A sad story.
C: NARUTO
D: Well--
N: The teacher’s gaze swish-pans to find: NARUTO UZUMAKI.
C: NARUTO
D: It’s definitely a sad story. But it’s also a great story.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: NARUTO
D: It’s got, uh, let’s see: love, and... extreme braveness, and... really awesome ninja doing incredible jutsu...
E: CONT'D
N: Naruto joins the teacher at the front.
C: TEACHER
D: Class, this is Naruto Uzumaki. The Fourth Hokage was his dad.
C: NARUTO
D: And my mom was the keeper of the Nine-Tails before I was. Fun fact, the Nine-Tails is inside me RIGHT NOW. Right in my tummy.
N: He shows everyone the sigil.
C: TAMAKI
D: Can I touch it?
C: NARUTO
D: You can totally touch it.
C: TEACHER
D: Naruto became a chunin ninja just last month, and now he’s studying to become a jonin.
C: NARUTO
D: Then after that I’m gonna be a Kage, and then one day the Hokage of all Konoha. You’re gonna see my face up there one of these days.
C: TEACHER
D: Which is sad for all of us, because this face is best in small doses.
E: affectionately
C: NARUTO
D: You know what they say, if you want to accomplish something great, it’s the first thing you gotta do.
C: TANAKI
D: What’s that?
C: NARUTO
D: Believe it.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
