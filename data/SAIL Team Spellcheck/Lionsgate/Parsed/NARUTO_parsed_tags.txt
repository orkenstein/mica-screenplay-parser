N: In a single frozen moment, decades ago, there stands a MAN.

0: 
N: A one-eyed finesse killer with a kusari-fundo, a diabolical

0: 
N: And at their helm, MINATO NAMIKAZI. A still-young leader with
N: blond hair and straight posture, a true and genuine soldier
N: of light.
0: 
N: Minato lets out a whoop like a bird cry. When the fox swivels
N: to face him, he performs three intricate hand gestures.
0: 
N: DAGGERS OF LIGHT emanate from Minato, piercing the fox in the
N: eye, the blades of light slicing the fox’s flaming fur.
0: 
N: The fox obliterates the building Minato stands on with a

0: 
C:                     TEACHER
D:           That’s him, see? Up there. He was

0: 
N: Orochimaru isn’t surprised to see Sarutobi. He makes a hand
N: gesture and a pinwheel of wind slices the air. Sarutobi
N: deflects with his gauntlet, and ATTACKS.
0: 
C:                     SARUTOBI (CONT'D)
D:           Orochimaru, what have you done?

0: 
S: EXT. BEHIND THE BARRICADE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
0: 
N: Minato dives behind the barricade and looks out. His eyes go
N: wide. He sees a BOY of no more than seven, barefoot, carrying
N: a YOUNGER BOY of no more than two, racing away from the fox.
0: 
N: Just as Minato sees the boys, the fox sees them too, sighting
N: down a sidestreet, and starts towards them.
0: 
N: It’s like a WAVE OF FIRE is flooding the street.
0: 
N: Minato throws daggers of light as he runs to the boys--
0: 
N: It’s not enough, he’s not going to make it--
0: 
N: And just then, the fox FREEZES.
0: 
N: Minato looks back to see KUSHINA (Minato’s age, red hair).
0: 
N: Kushina’s red hair is unbound, stuck to her face with sweat.
0: 
N: She wears a Shinobi headband and a flak jacket hastily thrown
N: on over a nightgown.
0: 0:                                                             5.
0: 
N: Her closed fists SHAKE with effort, like she’s holding
N: invisible chains. Her HANDS are keeping the fox in place.
0: 
N: Minato hurries the little boys to safety.
0: 
C:                     MINATO
D:           Kushina! Go back inside!
0: 
C:                     KUSHINA
D:           Don’t tell me what do to!
0: 
N: KAKASHI, the sly fighter with the kusari-fundo, arrives from
N: above in a deft three-point landing.
0: 
N: He sees Kushina’s hands, and the fox straining to move.
0: 
C:                     KAKASHI
D:           Kushina! Are you okay?
0: 
C:                     KUSHINA
D:           STOP ASKING ME IF I’M OK.
0: 
N: The fox strains. The invisible chains groan.
0: 
N: Minato and Kushina realize: The bonds won’t hold.
0: 
N: They look at each other. They know what they must do.

C:                     MINATO
E:               (to Kakashi)
D:           The aqueduct collapsed, go help
D:           there!
0: 
C:                     KAKASHI
E:               (winding his weapon)
D:           I can fight it, Lord Hokage!
0: 
C:                      MINATO
D:           KAKASHI!
0: 
N: Minato’s sharp tone gets Kakashi’s attention, but then he
N: says more gently:
0: 
C:                     MINATO (CONT'D)
D:           You’re good. But you’re not that
D:           good.
0: 
N: And Kakashi realizes: those are the last words he’ll ever
N: hear Minato say. He bows and races off, following orders.
0: 
N: And now, every step heavy with destiny, Minato comes to stand
N: alongside Kushina. He looks up at the fox.
0: 
C:                     MINATO (CONT'D)
E:               (to Kushina)

0: 
C:                     KUSHINA
D:           NO! YOU IDIOT. No.
0: 
N: When Kushina turns to face him, we see that she is CRYING.
0: 
C:                     KUSHINA (CONT'D)
D:           We were supposed to get old
D:           together.
0: 
C:                     MINATO
D:           I am so sorry, my love.
0: 
N: And with that, Minato performs a precise series of hand
N: gestures, his final act of faith.
0: 
N: And THE ENERGY OF THE FOX SEEMS TO FLOW INTO MINATO.
0: 
N: Kushina YELLS IN FURY as she holds the fox’s chains--
0: 
N: Minato grows brighter and brighter with the fox’s fire,
N: filling the frame with flames and thunderous sound--

D:           ...and they sacrificed their lives
D:           so that the city could be safe.
0: 
N: The kids stand wide-eyed, overloaded with emotion.
0: 
N: Naruto also stands wide-eyed, just like a little kid.
0: 
N: After a second he says, reverently:
0: 
C:                        NARUTO
D:           So badass.
0: 
C:                     YUI
D:           What does badass mean?
0: 
N: Okay--now the teacher’s getting a LITTLE BIT annoyed.
0: 
C:                     TEACHER
D:           Don’t you have somewhere to be?
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           No Sensei, I’ve been tragically
D:           left behind by the system.
D:           So stay in school, little buddies.
D:           That’s right, high five.
0: 
N: Naruto gives high fives to the kids, then runs off into...

S: EXT. KONOHA MARKET DISTRICT - DAY
0: 
N: ...Konoha’s crowded MARKET DISTRICT. Stalls overflowing with
N: bright fabric, tasty food, terrifying weapons.
0: 
N: Overhead, hand-painted billboards, telephone poles and criss-
N: crossing power wires create a mix of modern and mythical.
0: 
N: The shoppers and sellers are diverse. People of all genders,
N: predominantly East Asian, some black, white and brown.
0: 
N: A crotchety vegetable seller barks at Naruto as he passes by.

C:                     VEGETABLE SELLER
D:           Hey thief. Watcha stealing today?
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           A present for someone. And I’m NOT
D:           a thief. You should pay ME to eat
D:           your stinky vegetables.
0: 
N: With a fingertip, Naruto topples a pyramid of squash and runs.
0: 
C:                     VEGETABLE SELLER
E:               (gathering his squash)

N: Sudden quiet. A relaxed outdoor party for Konoha’s arty
N: beatniks. They smoke strange cigarettes and watch as:
0: 
N: A CALLIGRAPHER IN HER SEVENTIES paints calligraphy on a
N: transparent silk screen stretched like a volleyball net.
0: 0:                                                            10.
0: 
N: A MUSICIAN plays an ethereal electronic instrument, on the
N: line between digital and analogue.
0: 
N: And a PHOTOGRAPHER captures the performance with an elegant
N: flashbulb camera.
0: 
N: This scene will feel familiar to anyone who had the right
N: kind of friends in the 1960s.
0: 
N: Naruto skirts the edges of the outdoor terrace, comes to look
N: over the photographer’s shoulder.
0: 
N: The photos emerge from the camera and develop on the spot,
N: colors blooming like watercolor.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           You know, if you stand over here...
0: 
N: The photographer hands Naruto his camera.
N: Naruto gives him the haori, to free up his hands.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO (CONT'D)
D:           ...you can get Hokage Tower in the
D:           shot.
0: 
N: Naruto clicks the shutter, and the photo emerges.
0: 
N: The photographer takes the photo, impressed...
0: 
N: Naruto hands over the camera in exchange for the photo...
0: 
C:                     NARUTO (CONT'D)
D:           Thanks!
0: 
N: ...and jumps the bannister, onto the next rooftop.
0: 
N: It takes the photographer a second to realize he’s still
N: holding the haori.
0: 
C:                     PHOTOGRAPHER
D:           Hey, wait!!
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. ALLEYWAY WITH RED DOOR - DAY
0: 
N: Smack, Naruto’s feet hit the ground in a narrow alleyway.
0: 
N: He stares, entranced, at photograph in his hands.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           This is the perfect present.
0: 
N: And he runs RIGHT SMACK into a very large man.
0: 
N: The photo whips away on the wind, lost forever.
0: 0:                                                            11.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO (CONT'D)
D:           Hey! That was a gift!
0: 
N: The man wears a Shinobi headband loosely around his neck, but
N: it’s been defaced. He is some kind of FALLEN NINJA.
0: 
C:                     FALLEN NINJA
D:           You’re in the wrong part of town,
D:           leaping lizard.
0: 
N: Naruto looks: down the alleyway there’s a RED DOOR.
0: 
N: A few women and men smoke outside the door, also in defaced
N: Shinobi headbands. They gaze back with stony expressions.
0: 
N: Naruto hears the footsteps of the approaching Female Officer.
0: 
N: He says a silent prayer, and tells the Fallen Ninja:
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           Your breath smells like roadkill
D:           and your vest doesn’t go with those
D:           pants.
0: 
N: The Fallen throws him into a pile of trash and starts
N: punching him, just as the Female Officer arrives. AND NOW:
0: 
N: 1. The Officer drags the Fallen Ninja off of Naruto...
0: 
N: 2. The Fallen Ninja wheels to face the Officer...
0: 
N: 3. And Naruto is scot-free to make his escape.
0: 
N: Naruto turns to go--but he can’t take his eyes off the fight.
0: 
N: The Fallen Ninja makes precise hand gestures like the ones
N: we’ve seen, only his look somehow VULGAR.
0: 
N: IN SLOW MOTION: The GROUND CRACKS beneath the FEMALE OFFICER,
N: but she jumps in time and fires her net gun at the Fallen.
0: 
N: Naruto finally tears himself away, and scrambles onto...
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. INDUSTRIAL ALLEYWAY - DAY
0: 
N: Another industrial alleyway, where he is cornered by:
0: 
C:                     MALE OFFICER
D:           Stand for the law of Konoha!
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           I didn’t DO anything!
0: 
C:                     MALE OFFICER
D:           I arrested you last week!
0: 0:                                                         12.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           I didn’t do anything TODAY.
0: 
N: The Male Officer shoots his net gun at Naruto.
0: 
N: Naruto dodges, and runs STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE OFFICER.
0: 
N: Halfway between them there’s a dumpster full of defective
N: aluminum cans. Naruto overturns it, and scrambles to the top,
N: into a second floor window.
0: 
0: 
S: INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY
0: 
N: It’s a FACTORY FLOOR. Big iron machines churn out identical
N: cat-shaped cookies.
0: 
N: Naruto bolts down the aisle, the Male Officer close behind.
0: 
N: At the end of the aisle there’s a floor-to ceiling WINDOW
N: that one of the workers has just, conveniently, opened.
0: 
N: Naruto picks up speed.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           I’ve always wanted to do this.
0: 
N: With a breath and a prayer, he JUMPS--
0: 
0: 
S: INT. ADJACENT WAREHOUSE - DAY
0: 
N: --across to the adjacent building, where he crashes through
N: the window and stumbleskids to a stop.
0: 
N: The Male Officer shouts from across the alleyway.
0: 
C:                     MALE OFFICER
D:           Stand for the law!
0: 
N: Naruto JUMPS JUST IN TIME as the Male Officer wings his BOLA
N: at Naruto’s feet. It misses, and winds around a column.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           Hahahahaaa ya MISSED!
0: 
N: Frustrated, the officer runs off to find a different route.
0: 
N: But now Naruto unwinds the bola from the column. It’s
N: gorgeous, hand-wrought iron, engraved with Konoha’s seal.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO (CONT'D)
D:           Oh, wow.
D:           This is absolutely, without a doubt-
0: 0:                                                         13.

C:                     NARUTO
D:           --the PERFECT present for you, Iruka-
D:           san.
0: 
N: Gazing at the bola is IRUKA UMINO (30s), a serious young man
N: with a scar across his nose and a formal style of speech.
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
E:               (with great sincerity)
D:           Naruto, this is beautiful.
0: 
N: Naruto smiles, and by God the boy is beautiful when he smiles.
0: 
C:                     IRUKA (CONT'D)
D:           And no, you cannot enroll in the
D:           Shinobi Academy.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           Whhhhhat?? Who said anything about--
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           Naruto, I love you like my own son--
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           Oh come on, you’re not even that
D:           much older than me anymore!
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           --that is not how time works--
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           You know what I mean, we’re both
D:           MEN now.
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           --I love you like my own son but
D:           you have never gotten me a gift.
D:           Let alone one that was so...
D:           lovingly stolen.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
E:               (mumbling)
D:           Someone threw it at me actually,
D:           but whatever.
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           I have something for you, too.
0: 
N: He nods to the shop owner, who comes over.
0: 
C:                     IRUKA (CONT'D)
D:           Naruto may order... anything.
0: 0:                                                         14.

D:           Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat

C:                     IRUKA
D:           Happy birthday.

T:                                                   CUT TO:
0: 
N: Naruto is finishing his third ramen, empty bowls everywhere.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           So, about the Academy.
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
E:               (tensing up)
D:           Naruto, we’ve been through it.
D:           Ninja are born with something
D:           called chakra. Something they learn
D:           to harness, so they can do things
D:           like shoot fireballs and walk on
D:           water. Things you cannot do.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           They use JUTSU to walk on water.
D:           Here, like this:
0: 
N: Naruto imitates the hand gestures we’ve seen the Shinobi use.
0: 
N: Iruka gently clasps his hands, stopping him.
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           Jutsu are just things you do with
D:           your hands. It is the ninja’s
D:           chakra that gives them their power.
0: 
N: Iruka touches his chest, as if that’s where chakra resides.
N: Then he shakes it off, as if he’s said too much.
0: 
C:                     IRUKA (CONT'D)
D:           Besides, that place is pretentious.
D:           The faculty come into my shop
D:           sometimes. They have attitudes.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           Because they’re heroes. Heroes get
D:           to have attitudes.
0: 
C:                      IRUKA
D:           Please. I’m a hero. I work for a
D:           living.
E:               (beat)
D:           ...And you should too. You will be
D:           a good mechanic. If you would just
D:           listen to me every once in a while.
0: 0:                                                         15.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           You’re not even a good mechanic,
D:           dude.
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           I am not your dude. You need to
D:           cultivate a more respectful
D:           attitude towards your elders.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           Well tell my elders to respect me!
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           --that is not how time works--
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           I’m serious! Everywhere I go it’s
D:           “don’t you have somewhere to be”
D:           and “stop, thief” and “get away
D:           from my daughters”--
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           WHAT did you say?
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           No, it’s-- A girl gave me a--
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           WHAT did a girl give you?
0: 
N: Naruto takes a deep breath and gets to the point:
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           I see how people look at me.
0: 
N: QUICK FLASHES OF: the faces in the marketplace--the police,
N: the angry dad, the vegetable seller. Aggravated. Disdainful.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO (CONT'D)
D:           And I know I can be more.
D:           I just know it. I know it better
C:           than I know anything.
D:           I have to go to the Academy.
0: 
N: Iruka stops. Deeply moved by Naruto’s pain.
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           Oh, Naruto. You don’t need to be
D:           anything more than what you are...
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
E:               (mumbling again)
D:           That’s easy for you to say, you’re
D:           not the one who has to be it--
0: 0:                                                            16.

C:                     IRUKA
D:           ...you just need to be a MECHANIC.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           Uggggghhh Iruka-san!
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           Naruto, please. Your birthday is a
D:           happy day, but it is also a sad
D:           day. My entire family, our entire
D:           city, 17 years ago, wiped out.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           But--
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           My entire. Family.
0: 
N: Naruto stops. He knows not to disrespect Iruka’s family.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           Of course, Iruka-san.

S: EXT. RAMEN ICHIRAKU - LATER THAT NIGHT...
0: 
N: Naruto holds the door for his guardian.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           It’s just that I’ve actually been
D:           training to be a ninja, is the
D:           thing.
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           I SAID ENOUGH.
0: 
N: And now, to prove himself, Naruto TAKES A SWING at Iruka.
0: 
N: With lightning speed, Iruka blocks it.
0: 
N: Another swing, another elegant block.
0: 
N: Now 50 RAPID FIRE SWINGS AND BLOCKS.
0: 
N: Finally, each man looks at the other, and asks in unison:

C:                     NARUTO (CONT'D)
D:           I told you! Some guys at the gym
D:           help me out. I even found some old
D:           books, and--

C:                     IRUKA
D:           If you spent all that time in the
D:           shop you’d be very successful.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           You’re hard on me.
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           You make it easy.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           And wait, where’d YOU learn those
D:           moves?
0: 
N: Iruka takes the bola from his satchel, places it in Naruto’s
N: hands, and closes them.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO (CONT'D)
E:               (wounded, vulnerable)
D:           Wait--but it’s your present. I
D:           thought you liked it.
0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           You cannot go to the Academy. That
D:           is final.
0: 
N: With that, Iruka walks away.
0: 
N: Naruto is left alone, cupping the bola in his hands.

0: 
S: INT. NARUTO & IRUKA’S HOME - NIGHT
0: 
N: A modest studio apartment in a low-rise apartment building.
N: One shared room with two beds. Kitchen and bathroom right off
N: of it. Split right down the middle: Naruto’s side is a
N: complete mess and Iruka’s side is spotless. A tube TV plays a
N: SOAPY DRAMA FEATURING A HANDSOME NINJA in the background...
0: 
N: Iruka sleeps. Naruto stares at the ceiling, mind racing.
0: 
N: With sudden impulsiveness, he leaps out of bed.
0: 
N: BY THE DOOR
0: 
N: Naruto pulls on his jacket. Thinks for a second. Grabs a
N: scarf and wraps it around his face.
0: 
N: His eyes land on a faded photo of YOUNG IRUKA AND HIS FAMILY.
N: Next to that, a photo of Iruka and Naruto together.
0: 
N: Naruto looks at the pictures. Looks over at Iruka, asleep.
0: 
N: Then he takes a deep breath, and walks out.
0: 0:                                                            18.

S: EXT. ALLEYWAY WITH RED DOOR - NIGHT
0: 
N: Naruto creeps in shadow down the alleyway with the RED DOOR.
0: 
N: FROM A DISTANCE: Fallen Ninja congregate. Spitting, sparring.
0: 
N: Naruto looks up to the rooftops.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. ROOFTOPS OVERLOOKING COURTYARD - NIGHT
0: 
N: Naruto’s on the roof, looking down into a rainy COURTYARD,
N: the interior of the Fallen compound.
0: 
N: RECRUITS stand at attention as KIDOMARU, a Fallen Ninja,
N: paces in front of them. Naruto climbs down to listen in.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT
0: 
N: From ground level, Naruto can see that KIDOMARU HAS SIX ARMS.
0: 
C:                     KIDOMARU
D:           Again! Pinhole, river, dragon.
0: 
N: The recruits attempt a jutsu on a practice dummy.
0: 
N: The dummy hops a little, but nothing more.

C:                     KIDOMARU (CONT'D)
D:           What’s the matter, are you stupid?
D:           You sure look stupid.
0: 
N: Kidomaru’s breathing on the recruit’s cheek--VERY unsavory.
N: He’s sloppier and drunker than any drill sergeant should be.

N: And the WHOLE WORLD LURCHES with a stuttering, teeth-rattling
N: buzz, like a wrench dropped in the machinery of the universe.
0: 
N: It makes Naruto INSTANTLY PUKE. When he looks up, THE
N: PRACTICE DUMMY is OFF-SET, its top section four inches off
N: its bottom. An interruption in reality itself. You can
N: imagine what that would do to a human.
0: 
N: One of the recruits has a bloody nose and a few have thrown
N: up, just like Naruto. Kidomaru laughs, dabs the nose blood.

0: 
N: Naruto’s KNOCKED off his feet.
0: 
N: When he gets up, he sees that AN ENTIRE BUILDING HAS BEEN
N: OFFSET, blocking the alleyway completely.
0: 
N: Lights go on in the building. People come to the window.
0: 
N: On the other side of the building, the Fallen STARE.

D:           I don’t know what happened!
0: 
N: Over the doorkeeper’s shoulder, in the grain of the door, we

0: 
N: Now, the body steps away from the door. It looks as though
N: the door itself is moving. Until he’s far enough away that we
N: see a signature blue bandana around this man’s face. And he
N: transforms back into his true form, comes into focus. He was
N: using Ninja Camouflage Technique.
0: 
N: It’s KAKASHI, his Shinobi headband slanting over one eye.
N: He’s toughened up since we last saw him.
0: 
N: In rapid succession, Kakashi proceeds to DROP ALL THE NINJA
N: WE JUST MET. He breaks someone’s leg, traps someone’s hands
N: in a machine.
0: 
N: Most are not dead. None are going anywhere.
0: 
N: Kakashi scans the room. One left. It is Kidomaru. Who does
N: that “come at me” hand movement, with all 6 of his hands.
0: 
N: Kakashi LEAPS at Kidomaru, and they start SPARRING. They are
N: evenly matched, and it is brutal. Kidomaru FLIPS KAKASHI OVER
N: A TABLE, breaking the table in two--
0: 
N: But Kakashi wraps his ankle around one leg of the broken
N: table, toes it into his hand, and swivels to a fighting
N: stance, with broken table legs in either hand, like hatchets.
0: 
N: Kidomaru reconsiders his odds of winning this fight.

C:                     KAKASHI
D:           You’re gonna need more hands, bub.
0: 
N: Kidomaru throws a shuriken. Kakashi catches it--THWOCK--in
N: table leg, and when he looks up, Kidomaru is gone.
0: 
N: Kakashi runs to the window, peers outside...
0: 
N: No sign of him. But there’s commotion and shouting a few

0: 
N: No one has noticed the teenager collapsed in the shadows.
0: 
N: Except Kakashi. Kakashi’s face slides into Naruto’s POV:

C:                     NARUTO
D:           Hello, sir. You seem upset.

0: 
N: Kakashi stands over the boy, troubled. Looks at the building.
0: 
N: AND NOW, HE NOTICES A SIGIL ON NARUTO’S BELLY. A whorl around
N: his bellybutton, glowing through his clothes.
0:

C:                     KAKASHI
E:               (shrugging)

D:           Sure.
0: 
N: And for a moment, it almost looks like Naruto is going to
N: tear up. Iruka sees a wisp of ORANGE ENERGY pulse from within
N: him. His eyes FLASH RED. Iruka looks at him, concerned.
0: 
N: And just as quickly, that foxfire disappears.
0: 
N: ...Naruto walks off, never looking back. Iruka stares after
N: the boy. Sarutobi puts his arm on his shoulder.

N: his ramen. He plucks it out and dries it off.

E:               (as a helpful aside:)

N: A RESIDENT ADVISOR guides a bruised Naruto to his room.
0: 
N: On a placard outside the door, 4 names: Choji Akimishi, Kiba
N: Inusuka, Shino Aburame-- and Rando Tabata, (crossed out).
N: Naruto enters. The other kids are studying.
0: 
N: Naruto groans as he sits on his bed, rubs his sore knee.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           Who woulda thought getting your ass
D:           kicked all day would be so painful?
0: 
N: He’s bunkmates with Choji, a heavy kid with a low-affect
N: style of speech, maybe not neurotypical. (We saw Choji’s dad
N: fight the Nine-Tailed Fox--the warrior with the giant fist.)
0: 
C:                     CHOJI
D:           Everyone. That’s obvious.

C:                     CHOJI
D:           I don’t know what that means. I

N: Later. Naruto’s light is the only one still on. He’s
N: studying. Everyone else is asleep.
0: 
N: Naruto closes his book, turns the light off, closes his eyes,
N: tries to sleep. But quickly, his eyes open again.
0: 
N: This kid, who’s felt alone a whole lot in his life, has never
N: felt so alone. He rolls over in bed to look out at the sky.

0: 
S: EXT. STREETS OF KONOHA - NIGHT
0: 
N: We can see who it is now: Kabuto Yakushi, the instructor who
N: called Naruto a worm.
0: 
N: He passes by the OCCUPIED BAR, that same bar Kidomaru
N: stumbled into after Kakashi wrecked him.
0: 
N: A throng of drunk Fallens loiter outside.
0: 
C:                     DRUNK FALLEN
D:           They said I was derelict in my
D:           duties. What’s that even MEAN?
0: 
N: For a second, Kabuto copies the Fallens’ mannerisms, blending
N: in perfectly as he weaves though the crowd.
0: 
C:                     KABUTO
D:           THEY’RE the derelict ones, am I
D:           right?
0: 
N: As soon as Kabuto’s clear of the Fallens, the grin drops off
N: his face. The man’s a survivor. Built to blend in.

0: 
S: INT. WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
0: 
N: Kabuto sits in an imposing room. He’s startled by a sound.
0: 
N: A WOMAN shuffles in, barefoot, in a plain smock that a
N: patient might wear in a Victorian hospital.
0: 
C:                        WOMAN
D:           Some. Tea?
0: 
N: She sounds unwell, or not in full control of her mind.
0: 
C:                      KABUTO
E:               (hiding his discomfort)
D:           Thank you.
0: 
N: A door opens in the opposite wall, and a man enters:
0: 
N: OROCHIMARU. The man who unleashed the Nine-Tailed fox.
0: 
N: Kabuto leaps out of his chair, nervous and respectful.
0: 
N: For a second, the men regard each other.
0: 0:                                                            38.

D:           My BOY.
0: 
C:                     KABUTO
D:           Orochimaru-sama.
0: 
N: Orochimaru comes over and musses Kabuto’s hair. He’s
N: possessive and affection with Kabuto, who is nervous and
N: submissive with him--a clear and stark power imbalance.
0: 
C:                     OROCHIMARU
D:           Are you eating? They feeding you
D:           over there? I hate it when you come
D:           back from that place, you look so
D:           skinny.

N: Orochimaru looks out on the Konoha cityscape.
0: 
C:                     OROCHIMARU
D:           When the Senju and Uchiha clans
D:           united to settle Konoha, the Senju
D:           gave the Uchiha control of the
D:           police force. And in exchange, the
D:           ninja Academy would be on the Senju
D:           side of town.
0: 
N: Kabuto looks out at the cityscape, at the Academy.
0: 
C:                     OROCHIMARU (CONT'D)
D:           That’s a good deal, isn’t it? You
D:           keep the Uchiha out of city
D:           politics, since the police have to
D:           be neutral.
D:           In exchange, you get the stronghold
D:           of the greatest martial artists
D:           that the world has ever known. Its
D:           walls made impregnable by
D:           generations of ninja. Tens of
D:           thousands of obscure jutsu in its
D:           libraries, waiting to be
D:           discovered. Whoever holds the
D:           Academy holds Konoha.

0: 
C:                     OROCHIMARU
D:           It’s my right. I used to be the
D:           school’s most favored son. I’ll rule
D:           the city from behind its walls.
0: 
C:                     KABUTO
D:           ...what about the students?
0: 
C:                     OROCHIMARU
D:           They’ll be my students. The ones
D:           that survive. And they can see for
D:           themselves the wealth of knowledge
D:           that’s been hidden from them.

C:                     KABUTO
D:           Sasuke? Top of his class.
D:           Disciplined. Driven.
0: 
C:                     OROCHIMARU
D:           Strong native chakra?

D:           The strongest I’ve seen. Why?

E:               (nervous)
D:           I don’t know. Eight Inner Gates?
0: 
C:                     OROCHIMARU
D:           The Eight Gates is 400 years old.
D:           Dai found it in a book and said he
D:           invented it. You see what I mean
D:           about library access.
0: 
N: They pass a vivisected cow. Kabuto looks a little ill.

0: 
C:                     KABUTO
D:           I should really be getting back...
0: 
C:                     OROCHIMARU
D:           What, are you nervous? What is
D:           this? Tense shoulders. What do you
D:           think I’ve got back there?
0: 
N: They round the corner to see an OPERATING TABLE...
0: 
N:                       ... with a TEENAGE BOY strapped to it.

0: 
C:                     OROCHIMARU
D:           See? Just a normal boy. Nothing to

0: 
C:                     TEENAGE BOY
D:           Please. Please let me go.
0: 
N: Kabuto turns to leave, but Orochimaru catches his arm.

C:                     OROCHIMARU
D:           Don’t look at him, look at me.
D:           Because the newest jutsu I know...
D:           goes something like this.
0: 
N: And he starts to do a jutsu that Kabuto has never seen.
0: 
C:                     KABUTO
D:           What is that? What are you doing?
0: 
N: The teenage boy WRITHES in agony as some ineffable energy is
N: leeched from his body, sucked up by Orochimaru.

N: And Kabuto looks at Orochimaru, until the screams end.
0: 
N: He can’t bring himself to look at the poor boy’s body.
0: 
N: Orochimaru’s LEFT HAND is still outstretched from stealing
N: the teenager’s life force. He looks...refreshed.
0: 
N: An now, he takes a big gulp of water, wipes his face with his
N: upper sleeve, holds out his RIGHT HAND--
0: 
N: And RELEASES THE STOLEN CHAKRA IN A FLAMING BLAST, completely
N: incinerating the boy’s body and charring half of the lab.
0: 
C:                     OROCHIMARU (CONT'D)
D:           Now. Imagine I try that on someone

N: Sasuke bursts out of the starting gate, crawls under barbed

0: 
N: Naruto runs close behind. Holding his own.
0: 
N: Sasuke arrives at a wall. He scrambles up it with cat-like
N: agility. So does Naruto. He closes in. They are side by side
N: now. Looking at each other as they hurtle forward. Rivals.
0:

C:                     SASUKE
D:           We have a plan! Don’t be a scroll

D:           What are you talking about?!
0: 
N: Naruto SWIPES the scroll from his own teammate, accelerates.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           You gave me no choice!
0: 
N: A furious Sasuke runs behind Naruto. Now, Sakura joins them:
0: 
C:                     SAKURA
D:           What is he doing?! NARUTO, YOU
D:           SELFISH DICK! YOU’RE GONNA BLOW IT!
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           That’s not very nice! I’m taking

0: 
C:                     SAKURA
D:           Ugh. Fine. Sasuke, block for him!
0: 
N: Sasuke does, reluctantly. He turns, sees Choji turn into a
N: GIANT BALL, that ROLLS TOWARD THEM BOTH. Sasuke turns, stops,
N: performs some hand gestures:
0: 
C:                     SASUKE
D:           Katon Goukakyuu no Jutsu!
0: 
N: He BLOWS FIRE at Choji, who rolls to evade and hits a tree.
N: Sasuke turns around, a little winded. He sees Naruto heading
N: toward the central tower.
0: 
N: ANGLE ON NARUTO. SFX: in his head, he hears cheering. The
N: crowd chanting his name. This is his moment. His time...
0: 
N: ANGLE ON KAKASHI. Watching from the stands arena. Next to
N: him, the rest of the faculty, including Sarutobi and Kabuto.
0: 
C:                     KAKASHI
D:           Pass the freakin’ scroll, kid...

0: 
N: ANGLE ON NARUTO. Running. Beatific smile on his face. This is
N: it! He’s gonna be the hero!
0: 
N: Then he sees SHIKAMARU running alongside him.
0: 
C:                     SHIKAMARU
D:           I hate you for making me run this
D:           fast.
0: 
N: They run onto a flat surface and now, their SHADOWS are
N: visible, stretching out in front of them, overlapping.
0: 
C:                     SHIKAMARU (CONT'D)
D:           My turn to pick the activity.
D:           Shadow possession jutsu!
0: 
N: Now their shadows overlap and COMBINE INTO ONE.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO
D:           No! What? Don’t possess my shadow!
0: 
N: Now, Shikamaru TOSSES HIS SCROLL over his shoulder, where
N: it’s caught by INO. His shadow (and Naruto’s) does the same.
0: 
C:                     NARUTO (CONT'D)
D:           No no no no no!
0: 
N: Simultaneously and through no will of his own, Naruto tosses
N: HIS scroll over HIS shoulder, where it’s caught by CHOJI.
0: 
C:                     INO
D:           YES! Perfect co-ordination!
0: 
N: NARUTO’S POV: Everyone is laughing at him. Except Sasuke and
N: Sakura, who glare. He runs to catch up, but it’s too late.
N: Because Shikamaru, Choji, and Ino are headed to the end zone,
N: passing, eluding defenders, and finally scoring.
0: 
N: They hold the scrolls aloft, hug each other. Heroes.

C:                      INSTRUCTOR ASUMA
D:           Team 7! You’re done for today!
D:           Shower up!
0: 
N: Naruto’s eyes glow red. And that halo of foxfire surrounds
N: him. It happens quickly. So quickly no one on the field even
N: notices. Their eyes are trained on Team 10.
0: 
N: But from high atop the field, Sarutobi sees. As does Kakashi.
N: He closes his eyes, troubled. Naruto walks away, hears Sasuke
N: say to Sakura:
0: 
C:                     SASUKE
D:           This kid’s gonna ruin our lives.

C:                        NARUTO
D:           Ahhh!

N: Naruto leaps into the fighting stance. The darkened figure
N: SWEEPS HIS LEG, throws him to the ground, stands above him:

C:                     KAKASHI
D:           We don’t train for wars in a
D:           classroom. We train where wars are
D:           fought. Forests, hills, deserts. We
D:           will train out there to earn the
D:           right to come back here.

0: 
N: But Kakashi’s already walking away.

D:           How long will we be gone for?
0: 
C:                     KAKASHI
D:           The Academy assigns us field
D:           missions in 2 months. Some time
D:           before then, hopefully. But it’ll

D:              You should’ve trusted your

0: 
C:                        SAKURA

D:           This is how we access our chakra...
E:               (beat)
D:           Our spiritual energy. You can’t get
D:           too excited. But you also cannot
D:           relax. You must find that moment in
D:           between. The moment that is now.
0: 
N: ANGLE ON Naruto, who has no idea what the fuck Kakashi is
N: talking about. But he watches, in awe, as Kakashi steps onto

D:           Like the flow of a battle, the

D:           thing you can control.
0: 
N: Balancing on the surface, Sakura gets a mischievous look.
0: 
N: She splashes Sasuke again. This time, Sasuke smiles, and

D:           Forbidden jutsu are those that

S: EXT. BARRICADE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
0: 
N: ...the night of the Nine-Tails attack. Kushina strides
N: towards the fox in her hastily-donned ninja attire, sees her
N: husband racing towards the two little boys.
0: 
N: This time we see Kushina perform the binding jutsu in full: a
N: circular motion in her hands, circling and winding tight.
0: 
N: The fox freezes where it stands. The invisible chains groan.

C:                     SARUTOBI (V.O.)
D:           The Nine-Tails attacked... almost
D:           at the very moment of your birth.
0: 
N: Now Kushina’s dishevelment makes sense, as do Minato’s words:
0: 
C:                     MINATO
D:           Kushina, get back inside!
0: 
C:                     KUSHINA
D:           Don’t tell me what to do!
0: 
N: Minato and Kushina realize: The bonds won’t hold.

C:                     SARUTOBI (V.O.)
D:           They both knew what they had to do.
0: 
N: And now, every step heavy with destiny, Minato comes to stand
N: alongside Kushina. He looks up at the fox.

D:           Are you ready?

D:           I am so sorry, my love.

C:                     SARUTOBI (V.O.)
D:           Minato summoned the fox’s yin
D:           energy into himself...
0: 
N: Minato performs his last jutsu, that last act of faith, and
N: THE ENERGY OF THE FOX SEEMS TO FLOW INTO HIM.
0: 
N: Kushina YELLS IN FURY as she holds the fox’s chains--
0: 
N: The frame fills with fire and sound but we KEEP WATCHING:
0: 
N: With its white yin energy drained, the fox is now deeper red,
N: even more rageful--

N: Kushina and Minato CHARGE into a maternity cabin--the room
N: where Naruto was born.
0: 
N: And BABY NARUTO is there.
0: 
N: Kushina cradles her baby, kisses his head, looks in his eyes.
0: 
N: He’s crying, but he settles when he sees her face.
0: 
N: And the cabin shakes as the fox comes towards them.
0: 
C:                     SARUTOBI (V.O.)
D:           ...And your mother called its yang

N: starts flowing into Naruto.

0: 
S: EXT. KONOHA SKYLINE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
0: 
N: The fox can FEEL ITS ENERGY BEING STOLEN. It begins to
N: UNRAVEL, losing shape and integrity, flames spilling
N: everywhere.
0: 
N: It FALLS over on its flank, crushing buildings, in agony.
0: 
N: It is DYING. And it’s searching for whoever is killing it.

0: 
N: He sees Minato. And Kushina. And the NINE-TAILED FOX.
0:

D: So, how did it work?
0: 
C:            IRUKA
D: I was a young Ninja, about your
D: age. I had just lost everyone I
D: loved. And Lord Sarutobi came to
D: me. He told me I was to be a
D: father. It was a matter of national
D: security, he said. Then he handed
D: me this...
E:     (he tears up)
D: ...this beautiful little boy. Who
D: held untold power within him. You
D: wrapped your little hand around my
D: thumb and smiled. And I began to
D: cry. They gave me a dossier. An
D: apartment. A job. I did as I was
D: told.
0: 
C:           NARUTO
D: I never knew the real you.
0: 
C:           IRUKA

D: for yourself.
0: 
C:           NARUTO
D: But you wouldn’t let me go to the
D: Academy.
0: 
C:           IRUKA
D: I did as they asked. For my
D: country. The firepower within you--
D: it could destroy worlds.
0: 
C:           NARUTO
D: I am not some weapon. I am a
D: person. I’m a kid!
0: 
C:           IRUKA
D: You think it was easy? Living with
D: you, knowing that thing was inside
D: you? The thing that killed my
D: parents? My friends? I devoted my
D: life to you.
0: 
C:            NARUTO
D: At least you had a choice. I never
D: asked for that! I never asked for
D: any of it!
E:     (beat)

D: me. You were supposed to love me.

0: 
C:                     IRUKA
D:           I didn’t give up my life. You

D:           that choice for a single second. I
D:           lost my parents, but I gained you.

D:           No. I’m glad you’re hungry.
0: 
N: The kids and their teacher eat, smile, make eye contact.
0: 
N: It’s good food. And somehow, it’s the tiny final puzzle piece
N: they needed to become a team.
0: 
N: Music swells, taking us into a....
0: 
N: MONTAGE
0: 
N: Sakura and Sasuke SPAR. Kakashi coaches. They wrap each other
N: up, then push each other off. Even though it’s violent, it’s
N: almost romantic. We PAN OFF THEM to Naruto. Standing there,
N: stone-faced. The balloon spinning right in front of him.
0: 
N: -TEAM 7 races each other to the top of trees and now running
N: across the branches. Sasuke shoots a fire jutsu at Naruto
N: clone, who leaps into the sky and corkscrews using a Jump
N: Jutsu...
0: 
N: -Sakura uses a healing jutsu on a wounded rabbit in the
N: forest.
0:

0: 
N: She breathes heavily, winded from the use of chakra. Naruto
N: nods thank you.
0: 
N: -Sasuke spars with Kakashi. He THROWS A FIRE JUTSU, followed
N: by a FLYING KICK, and knocks Kakashi to the ground!
0: 
N: He stands over Kakashi, smiles, REACHES HIS HAND TO PULL HIM
N: UP... Kakashi takes it.
0: 
N: -And finally, we see Naruto step out into the current, close
N: his eyes, and focus. He tunes everything out. All sound and
N: music disappears from our soundscape.
0: 
N: He starts to rise onto the water -- but he still can’t quite
N: do it. He falls, and is taken away by the current. He grabs
N: onto a rock and pushes up to the shore, out of breath.
0: 
N: But undaunted.
0: 
C:                     KAKASHI (O.S.)

S: EXT. FOREST - DAY
0: 
N: The waterfall test. Kakashi stands on the shore, book in
N: hand, and peers over the pages at Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura,
N: all in the water, fighting against the current. Sasuke and
N: Sakura are walking on the water, but Naruto struggles still.

C:                      KAKASHI
D:           ENOUGH !
0: 
N: Meanwhile, Naruto somehow appears by Kakashi’s side. As
N: Kakashi takes one more step, and...
0: 
N: IS HOISTED HIGH ABOVE THE GROUND INTO A TRAP
0: 
N: Naruto simultaneously snatches the book right from his hands.
N: He holds it up above his head. Team 7 looks up, smiling:
0: 
C:                      NARUTO
D:           GOTCHA !
0: 
N: Kakashi looks at Naruto, then turns to see ANOTHER NARUTO
N: standing in the water.

N: As Naruto conjures 2 more clones. And a couple
N: more...until...a full dozen.
0: 
C:                     KAKASHI
D:           Oh no. One of you was too much.
0: 
N: The clones disappear as Team 7 celebrates! And Kakashi
N: begrudgingly accepts defeat. He reaches into his pocket for a
N: knife, cuts himself free, elegantly lands on the ground:
0: 
C:                     KAKASHI (CONT'D)
D:           Good one. You got me. Good acting
D:           too. Especially you, Sakura. You
D:           really surprised me with that
D:           performance.
0: 
C:                     SAKURA
D:           This whole thing was my idea!

C:                     KAKASHI
D:           But, seriously. Give the book back.
0: 
N: Naruto grabs it from Sakura, flips through it.

S: EXT. NINJA ACADEMY CAMPUS
0: 
N: The giant doors to the academy swing open. Teams are sparring
N: and practicing jutsu. A HUSH falls as Naruto, Sakura and

0: 
C:                     SASUKE (O.S.)
D:           Are you checking yourself out?

C:                        NARUTO
D:           Hells yes.
0: 
N: Sasuke sighs... but also poses just the TINIEST BIT behind
N: Naruto. For a second they look like a boy band.

C:                     SAKURA (O.S.)
E:               (faintly overheard)
D:           Yes, mom. I understand.
0: 
N: They look up to see Sakura with HER PARENTS.
0: 
N: Sakura’s parents are VERY proud. Both crying. Hugging her.
0: 
N: Sakura makes eye contact with her teammates, smiles.
0: 
N: And Sasuke and Naruto, the two orphan boys, wave back at her.
0: 
N: For a moment the boys with no parents watch Sakura with hers.

D:           crushes on us.
0: 
N: Meanwhile, KAKASHI lingers at the fringes.
0: 
N: He realizes he’s drifted to a WALL OF PHOTOS.
0: 
N: In one photo, YOUNG OROCHIMARU stares at the camera alongside
N: his teammates Tsunade and Jiraiya...and his teacher Sarutobi.
0: 
N: In another photo, YOUNG KAKACHI smiles alongside his
N: teammates Obito and Rin...and his teacher, Minato Uzumaki.
0: 
C:                     SARUTOBI
D:           You were Minato’s favorite student.
D:           And today you teach his son.

E:               (quick bow)
D:           Hokage.
0: 
N: Now Sarutobi lands on the picture of himself and Orochimaru,
N: and his wise face displays unmistakable grief.
0: 
C:                     SARUTOBI
D:           I tried not to have a favorite
D:           student.
0: 
N: Young Orochimaru gazes at Sarutobi from the photo.
0: 
N: QUICK FLASH OF: Orochimaru summoning the Nine-Tailed Fox, the
N: flames, the destruction, the lost young man in the photograph
N: grown up to become a monster.
0: 
N: Kakashi can see what Sarutobi is going through. He offers:

C:                     KAKASHI
D:           These kids have a way of getting
D:           under your skin, don’t they.
0: 
C:                     SARUTOBI
D:           I know you got under Minato’s. You
D:           owe a lot to this place, Kakashi.
0: 
C:                     KAKASHI
D:           You could probably say I owe
D:           everything to this place.
0: 
N: And just at that moment... Sarutobi senses that something is
N: wrong in the world.
0: 
N: It’s just a feeling--a dissonant note in the score. Sarutobi
N: looks around the room to see:
0: 0:                                                           91.

N: ... Ino flipping her hair deliberately in Sakura’s face
0: 
N: ... Shino dropping a bug down Kiba’s back
0: 
N: ... Naruto dancing with Hinata, (who dances VERY VERY shyly).
0: 
N: The kids look excited, unaware of anything sinister brewing.
0: 
N: But Sarutobi turns, gravely, to Kakashi.
0: 
C:                     SARUTOBI
D:           If something happens during the
D:           exams... protect this place.
0: 
C:                     KAKASHI
D:           ...What could happen?
0: 
N: Kakashi looks around the room, trying to see what Sarutobi
N: saw, or didn’t see. Just then they’re interrupted by:
0: 
C:                     KABUTO
D:           Hokage, let me congratulate you.
0:

D:           life, and the lives of their
D:           teammates, into their own fragile
D:           human hands? What are hands,

S: EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY
0:

C:                     KAKASHI
D:           KABUTO!
0: 
N: Kabuto turns back to see Kakashi. His expression is complex--

0: 
C:                     KABUTO
D:           He’ll kill me if I disobey.
D:           It’s you or me.

0: 
N: But Kabuto does that Corporeal Manipulation Jutsu, freezing
N: the guards where they stand.
0: 
N: Now Kakashi turns to see: Kidomaru, Tayuya, Sakon, Jirobo,
N: and an ARMY of other Fallen Ninja from the occupied bar,
N: emerging from the sidestreets, headed towards the Academy.
0: 
N: He palms his kunai, and stands alone before the open gates.
0:

0: 
N: Kidomaru RUSHES Kakashi, who dodges. Kakashi is SO FAST.
0: 
N: But Kidomaru has four extra hands to do jutsu with.
0: 
N: And now, Kidomaru performs Orochimaru’s CHAKRA-ROBBING JUTSU.
0: 
N: Kakashi dives out of the sightline of Kidomaru’s raised hand.
0: 
N: The jutsu hits one of the frozen guards, who begins to
N: CONVULSE as Kidomaru drains her chakra--
0: 
C:                     KIDOMARU
D:           This time we know some new tricks.
0: 
N: Kakashi realizes in horror what’s happening.
0: 
N: Kakashi kicks Kidomaru’s hand out of the way and the guard
N: drops to the ground...then GETS TO HER FEET, awakened by the
N: attack.
0: 
N: Now Kakashi is RUSHED by the gang. Jirobo bearhugs him, but
N: he manages to kick Tayuya in the face with his arms pinned.
0: 
N: The other Fallen Ninja move towards the open gate.
0: 
N: Kakashi shouts at the awakened guard:

E:               (raising her fists)
D:           We have to stop him.
0: 
N: But then Sasuke looks at Sakura with an expression she has
N: never seen on his face: pure terror.
0: 
N: Seeing how scared he is makes her scared.
0: 
N: Without another word, she RUNS.

S: EXT. ACADAMY GATES - DAY
0: 
N: The lone guard tries to close the gates single-handed as
N: Kakashi is ABSOLUTLEY MOBBED, everyone attacking him at once,
N: the OPPOSITE of proper kung-fu movie etiquette.
0: 
N: He finally FLIPS JIROBO INTO TAYUYA, clearing a tiny bit of
N: space. He whirls in a circle of foes.
0:

N: Where it HITS the guard who’s trying to close the gate.
0: 
N: Tayuya whips out that BLOW GUN she used to kill the rat
N: earlier. It turns out it’s a FLUTE. She plays demonic music--
0: 
N: Now, her Doki (three OGRE-LIKE creatures) emerge from the
N: city. She looks at them:

C:                        TAYUYA
D:           Good boys.
0:

N: Chakra swirls around Orochimaru like electric coils. He wraps

D:           Sure thing.

N: Orochimaru HURLS THEM TO THE SHORE. They hit trees, land with

E:               (shrugs)

0: 
N: The world shakes around Naruto. The soundscape booms with
N: destruction. He tunes it all out. And tries again.
0: 
N: He takes his first steps onto the river. Finally, and for the
N: first time, HE CAN WALK ON WATER.
0: 
N: He stands strong. In the face of Orochimaru’s blasting raw
N: power toward him. He creates a forcefield around himself and
N: strides toward them.

C:                     OROCHIMARU (CONT'D)
D:           Your parents would be so

E:               (beat)
D:           They wanted a warrior. Like them.
D:           But you’re nothing like them, are
D:           you. You’re just a punk kid and
D:           that’s all you’ll ever be. They’d

E:               (not so sure)

0: 
N: The demon bursts forth scattering his remains: a column of
N: raw energy surrounded by flickering tails of flame.
0: 
N: Orochimaru looks at the demon in awe and joy. It’s an
N: incredible, terrible sight: the monster freed, expanding
N: rapidly, towering above him. He raises his hands to draw in
N: its power...
0: 
N: ...and then gasps in pain, confusion on his face.
0: 
N: Looking down, he sees Sasuke’s blade protruding through his
N: stomach.
0: 
N: THE NINE TAILS WAS JUST A GENJUTSU PERFORMED BY SAKURA!
0: 
N: While Orochimaru was entranced by it, Sasuke snuck up on him
N: and pierced his heart with his blade!

0: 
N: He seizes Orochimaru, power CRACKLING as he forces energy

D:           All that stuff you said? About me

D:           that’s fine.
0: 
N: On the edge of control, his skin lit with power from the
N: inside out, lines of fire like fox whiskers sear through his

N: Naruto’s energy surges and Sasuke strikes, delivering the
N: massive bolt of lightning as Sakura buries the sword in

0: 
N: SCREAMING, Orochimaru burns from the inside out, and his

D:           But don’t ever talk shit about my

0: 
N: Is it over? Did they really do it?
0: 
N: Naruto wobbles on his feet, and PASSES OUT.

0: 
C:                     KAKASHI (V.O.)
D:           ...and that’s what perplexed Riko:
