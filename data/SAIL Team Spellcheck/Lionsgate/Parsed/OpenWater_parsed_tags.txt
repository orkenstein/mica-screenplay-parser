0: 
N: As the Boeing 787 is going to ditch. The plane loses wing
N: balance. The tip of the right wing goes down and grazes the
N: water.
0: 
N: If it catches it at that speed, the aircraft will simply
N: disintegrate.
0: 
0: 
N: IN COCKPIT -
0: 
N: Chambers realizes the wings are not leveled and manages to
N: pull the plane back up in the air for a very short moment.
N: Just enough to bring the horizontal balance straight.

0: 
N: COCKPIT-
0: 
N: Captain Chambers focuses on keeping the plane level as it’s
N: losing speed.
0: 
N: Just a little longer but-
0: 
0: 
N: OUSTIDE THE PLANE-
0: 
N: One of the engines tears off from the wing, forcing water
N: pressure on the other wing to turn the aircraft sharply 90

N: THE PLANE PROPELS BACK UP IN THE AIR!
0: 
0: 
N: INSIDE THE PLANE-
0: 
N: Madness ensues.   Everything happens at once--
0: 
N: A deafening smash of metal against ocean, overtaken by--
0: 
N: THE ROAR OF FRICTION FORCES-- gnashing like a hurricane in
N: your middle ear-- drowning out a chorus of blood-curdling
N: cries--
0: 
N: Passengers shook like ragdolls-- heads crashing into the back
N: of seats--
0: 
N: -the groan of metal heralds the fracture of fiberglass-
0: 
N: -the wall splitting open right next to Kate & Dawn-Marie's
N: heads- the noise like thunder as-
0: 
N: THE ENTIRE PLANE SNAPS IN HALF
0: 
N: Splitting open like a coconut. The two pieces hanging by
N: threads, jackknifing like a semi-trailer over the ocean--
0: 
N: Kate at the coalface of the rupture-- staring wide-eyed out
N: the gaping maw that looks over open water as her half of the
N: plane breaks off, flung in a wide sweeping arc--
0: 
N: Entire rows of passengers tossed out into the depths, still
N: strapped to their seats, doomed--

0:

0: 
N: Dawn-Marie hasn't.
0: 
N: She struggles, then spasms...
0: 
N: ...and drowns...
0: 
N: Right before Kate's eyes. The sight hitting her hard.   Her
N: chin quivers, bubbles escaping.
0: 
N: Fighting to hold her breath.
0: 
N: Silent memories flash in her mind-
0: 
N: Her seven year old daughter holding her hand, running...
0: 
N: Kate is still sinking.
0: 
N: Fatally strapped to the seating structure, like a stone
N: around her neck...
0: 
N: Juliette on her father’s shoulders fighting over cotton
N: candy. Laughing.
0: 
N: Kate furiously fumbling for her belt buckle...
0: 
N: ...Debris and bodies bombing down around her...
0: 
N: In the rear view mirror, Juliette falling asleep in the back
N: seat as they are driving home by night...
0: 
N: Kate’s fingers blindly groping at the latch, desperate to
N: find purchase-- finding it and--
0: 
N: Unlatching herself...
0: 
N: The seating structure releasing her from its death grip.
0: 
N: Dawn-Marie's body sinking into the void with eyes wide open--
N: A BRIGHT-YELLOW UNOPENED RAFT KIT CLUTCHED IN HER ARMS--
0: 
N: Kate, stricken, prying her gaze away to swim for the top...
N: shooting upwards-

0: 
0: 
N: --she's yanked to an abrupt stop-- dragged down again-- what
N: the fuck-- she looks back-- and her eyes gape at--
0: 
N: Her life vest. Snagged on a piece of loose seatbelt cord--
0: 
N: She madly kicks at it, face creased with resolve...
0: 
N: Not gonna die like this.
0: 
N: She removes it from her neck. Her lungs ready to burst; she
N: grimaces with fading exertion--
0: 
N: But then-
0: 
N: About to drown, she remembers something!
0: 
N: Swims down instead of upward, to reach Dawn-Marie who just
N: landed on the sandy bottom of the ocean.
0: 
N: Grabs the raft kit from her and-
0: 
N: Pulls the cord on the side-- FFFOOOOSH!    CO2-fueled inflation-
0: 
N: The sudden surge of buoyancy rips her off-- and she shoots up
N: like a champagne cork-- releasing all the air in her lungs
N: with a singular defiant roar and--
0: 
N: BREAKING THE SURFACE, holding like dear life to the yellow
N: inflated raft.
0: 
N: Gasping an almighty lungful of air, both sweet relief and
N: terror gripping her face as she thrashes around in the middle
N: of-

0: 
N: THE PACIFIC FUCKING OCEAN
0: 
N: A rush of discordant noises invades our soundscape. Kate
N: panting hell-for-leather, spinning in circles, taking in the
N: scale of devastation-
0: 
N: Dozens of passengers in life jackets bobbing up and down,
N: most dead, some alive, all at the mercy of the swells...
0: 
N: The once-pristine ocean now strewn with a farrago of airplane
N: parts and luggage.
0: 
N: Kate vomits out sea water.   Awash in disarray.
0: 
N: Flaming hunks of debris burn out of control.   A doll melts
N: under flames, its glass eyes falling out.
0: 
N: Steadying herself, she cups her hands around her mouth --

D:           belongings. Take nothing with you.
0: 
N: Despite his injuries, the flight attendant knows the exact
N: procedure to follow. Removes the survival kit next to the
N: door and, twisting the lever, disengages the locks to release
N: the EVACUATION SLIDE which inflates instantly.
0: 
N: Same thing on the other side with another crew member.
0: 
N: They both attach the survival kits to the slide using large
N: carabiners.
0: 
N: The slides are ready-
0: 
N: So are the passengers who start pushing each other to exit
N: this hellhole. A lot of bruises, cuts, bloodied faces...

0: 
N: On both sides of the plane, the few surviving passengers fill

0: 
N: BACK WITH KATE-

0: 
N: Kate could cry, but bottles up her pain. There’s more people
N: to save...
0: 
N: She swims away from the raft in search for other survivors-
0: 
N: A severely-burnt woman floats by in a life jacket. Kate grits
N: her teeth and swims for the lady-
0: 
N: Dead.
0: 
N: Kate spots a few people with no life jackets, desperately
N: treading water...

0: 
N: Using a knife, the flight attendant in charge cuts the slide

0: 
N: But Lisa is already petrified - Two more sharks just entered
N: the fuselage from another emergency exit...
0: 
N: There’s only a thin air pocket left at the very top of the
N: cabin. They stand on the elbow rests under water, trying to
N: maintain their balance.
0: 
N: Omar and Lisa are trapped- Only their faces stick out of the
N: surface.
0: 
N: Suddenly, unconscious Namrata gets yanked down a bit. Omar
N: resists, holding her tight but she is violently pulled out of
N: his arms.
0:

N: Using the seats, Lisa and Omar pull themselves towards the
N: exit.
0: 
N: They’re almost there, when-
0: 
N: A shark swims right in front of them!
0: 
N: Omar pulls Lisa behind a row of seats.
0: 
N: The shark is too thick to reach them.
0: 
N: It tries several times to bite them, but the seats hold it
N: back.
0: 
N: They are running out of breath -
0: 
N: Omar grabs the drop-down oxygen masks that are floating above
N: them. Cuts off a mask and tries to breathe through the tube
N: directly.
0: 
N: It works but not enough air is coming. He grabs another one,
N: does the same and starts breathing from both tubes. Then
N: gives them to Lisa. They go back and forth.

N: ON KATE’S RAFT-
0: 
N: The two little girls are catatonic. The youngest one holding
N: tight on Kate.
0: 
N: She hears someone calling her name. She turns around and
N: spots in the distance-
0: 
N: One of the flight attendants, waving both arms from the other
N: slide/raft full of survivors-
0: 
N: Kate waves back, relieved to find someone who could help but-
0: 
0: 
N: ABOARD THE FLOATING SLIDE-
0: 
N: The other group notices that the raft they are on is starting
N: to pivot on itself!
0: 
N: No one understands what is happening now...
0: 
N: Suddenly the parachute anchor tightens as if caught by a
N: torpedo and pulls the entire raft-
0: 
N: The flight attendant loses balance and falls into the water!
0: 
N: The other passengers look on terrified.
0: 
N: The raft gains speed and gets further from the wrecked
N: aircraft.
0: 
N: Then, the rope heads down into the depths...
0: 
N: The front of the raft is pulled down and water rushes
N: inside...
0: 
N: The passengers panic and scream as-
0: 
N: The entire life boat is submerged like a submarine.
0: 
N: The fifty passengers disappear instantly beneath the surface.
0: 
N: ... Then they suddenly pop up like fishing corks, saved by

0: 
0: 
N: Then, it spins and heads back towards the floating
N: passengers. Whatever is pulling the raft is coming straight
N: for them...
0: 
N: At full speed...
0: 
N: READY TO STRIKE!
0: 
N: Kate watches helplessly. Sees them vanishing.
0: 
N: She looks around, no other flight attendant among the

D:           this time he had given me the keys.
D:           A few miles from our exit on the

D:           sleep. My mind was racing again,
D:           picturing the worst. That any day
D:           now, I will lose hope. And I’ll
D:           have to make a horrible decision.
D:           But what if hoping is a horrible

E:               (to the others)
D:           Quick! Help me pull!
0: 
N: They’re already surrounding her and pulling as hard as they
N: can.
0: 
N: Luis and Lisa glide through the water as--
0: 
N: The dorsal fin breaks the surface. Slicing closer...
0: 
N: Lisa and Luis get pulled out and onto the wing!
0: 
N: The shark slams into the metal before swimming away.
0: 
N: Lisa lies unconscious on the wing. She’s not out of the
N: woods.
0: 
N: Luis moves aside making room for Omar who kneels next to her.
0: 
N: He leans in to feel her breath and feels the pulse on her
N: wrist.
0: 
C:                     OMAR
D:           She’s not breathing and I can’t
D:           feel her pulse.
0: 
N: Omar starts CPR. He pumps her chest and blows air in her
N: mouth.
0: 
N: He’s methodical and calm under pressure.
0: 
N: Omar repeats the same action...
0: 
N: Lisa is the same. No change. Luis looks on worried.
0: 
N: So does Kate. She cannot bear to watch Lisa die in front of
N: her.
0: 
N: Omar continues resuscitating Lisa- Pumping and blowing over
N: and over.
0: 
N: Water projects out of Lisa’s mouth!
0: 
N: Omar leans down to listen to her chest.
0: 
N: Kate and the students have a sliver of hope, until--
0: 
C:                     OMAR (CONT'D)
D:           The water is out of her lungs and I
D:           can hear her heartbeat, but she’s
D:           still unconscious.
0: 
N: Omar is helpless, exhausted...

0: 
0: 
N: Kate has no intention of giving up now. She turns to the
N: survival kit with another idea in mind.
0: 
C:                     OMAR (CONT'D)
D:           Lisa, can you hear me? Wake up.
D:           Lisa, if you hear me wake up.
0: 
N: Reaching into the survival kit, Kate pulls out a plastic
N: packet of medical capsules. She hands them to Omar.
0: 
C:                     KATE
D:           Here. Try this.
0: 
N: Kate has found reanimation salts.
0: 
N: For her, it’s personal. Like she’s trying to save her own
N: daughter.
0: 
N: Omar pops the pill from the packet and breaks it under Lisa’s
N: nose. After inhaling for a few seconds--
0: 
N: Lisa regains consciousness like a bolt of lightning going
N: through her body.
0: 
N: Her eyes open wide and she screams like an asthmatic gasping
N: for air.
0: 
C:                     OMAR
D:           That’s good. That’s good. Breathe.
D:           It’s going to be okay...
0: 
N: Pam looks in every direction. 360 degrees.
0: 
C:                     PAM
D:           Where is it?
0: 
N: They all looks for the giant fin, but there is no sign.
0: 
N: Kate looks at the sun above the clouds. They’re past dawn,
N: but by how much?
0: 
N: Margo interrupts--
0: 
C:                     MARGO (O.S.)
D:           Look! A boat! Over there!

N: the horizon.

D:           Where?

E:               (insisting)
D:           There!!
0: 
N: It’s true. A tiny shape cut out in the distance with a small
N: spot of color- A CONTAINER SHIP?
0: 
C:                     JONAH
D:           You think they can see us?
0: 
N: The shape is three times smaller than the tip of his index
N: finger. There is no chance they’ve been spotted.

D:           I don’t know...

0: 
C:                     OMAR
D:           Stop now. You’re wasting your

D:           see us even without a flare.

N: The sun reaches its zenith.
0: 
N: The heat has taken grip and only two bottles of water remain.
0: 
N: Kate inspects the great white teeth marks on the wing.
0: 
N: She leans down and pulls out-
0: 
N: A SHARK TOOTH stuck in the metal. It’s huge. Almost as big as
N: her palm.

0: 
C:                     KATE
D:           If they attack at sunrise and
D:           sunset, it means it will be back
D:           before night fall to finish us off.
D:           We should be ready for it.
0: 
C:                     OMAR

0: 
C:                     KATE
D:           It changes the way it hunts. It’s
D:           adapting. You saw it too. If we
D:           don’t kill it, it’s going to kill
D:           us. Every last one of us.
0: 
N: Exhausted, they all look at Kate not knowing what to think.
N: None of them seem up to the challenge. Kate is pumped, but

D:           I don’t know about you, but I’m not

0: 
C:                     GARY
D:           What if we trap it?
0: 
N: Everyone turns to him. A trap?

0: 
0: 
C:                     GARY (CONT'D)
D:           It’s adapting. But it will always
D:           be guided by instincts. That’s why
D:           it’s consistently attacked our
D:           rafts. Maybe it’s obsessed with the
D:           color or the shape.
0: 
N: The survivors are not sure where he’s going with this.
0: 
C:                     GARY (CONT'D)
D:           We can use that to our advantage.
D:           If we could use the raft to attract
D:           it, maybe we can use it to trap it
D:           too. Trap it, and kill it.
E:               (a beat)
D:           I know it’s a gamble, but that’s

0:

0: 
N: ASHLEY looks at the flute.
0: 
N: She rips the rod from the main body, assembles the
N: instrument, and then pushes the broken rod into the end of
N: the cylinder.
0: 
N: Now the flute is longer and sharp enough to penetrate flesh.
0: 
N: KATE attaches the shark tooth to the end of the used flare
N: with guitar string- It’s now a knife.
0: 
N: LUIS open’s Trisha’s guitar case and removes the guitar. He
N: could’ve never imagined using it for anything but making
N: music.
0: 
N: He removes the strings... breaks the neck from the body and
N: attaches the bungee chord to the tuning pegs.
0: 
N: He takes the frame of the music stand and dismantles it to
N: collect the metal legs. Luis puts one end of a leg into the
N: bungee-
0: 
N: He pulls back on the elastic and releases-
0: 
N: In a split second, the metal leg shoots out and plants into
N: the wing! The music professor has just turned a guitar into a
N: CROSSBOW.
0: 
N: On his hands and knees, GARY uses guitar wires to fix the
N: rips caused by the sharks’s fin.
0: 
N: Using the leftover metal stand, LISA builds a spear,
N: fashioning fabric from a life vest into a handle.
0: 
N: OMAR and JONAH work together to break the flat part of the
N: paddle. They struggle with it until it finally splits.
0: 
N: They inspect their improvised weapon finding it surprisingly
N: sharp. Satisfied, they go to work on the second paddle.
0: 
N: PAM and GARY wrap the line around the deflated raft’s
N: railing, until finally-
0: 
N: They pull on each side of the rope squeezing the
N: circumference of the raft together like a slip knot.
0: 
N: It looks like a trap...
0: 
N: Everyone puts the final touches on their weapons and will
N: soon find out if they’re up to the task.

N: arching above the water like a tent.
0: 
N: Luis attaches the blood bottles on the edge of the wing and
N: in the center of the arch.
0:

N: not seeing one at all. Not knowing from which angle it will

0: 
N: It’s only trapped halfway up the second dorsal fin.

0: 
N: The shark turns and twists, flailing its fins, trying to free

0: 
N: He tries to catch it but it slides on the metal and falls
N: into the water...
0: 
N: He reloads, but he’s only got one left after this.
0: 
N: Luis pulls back on the bungee and aims at the shark’s head,
N: when-
0: 
N: A violent vibration shakes the wing forcing his shot astray.
0: 
N: The passengers hold each other desperately trying to stay out
N: of the water.
0: 
N: The shark has wiggled itself to the edge- It’s close to being
N: free.
0: 
N: Gary sees Kate’s harpoon next to him. He grabs the weapon,
N: stands, and lifting the harpoon above his head-
0: 0:                                                            91.

D:              HAAAAAAAA!!!
0: 
N: BUT ANOTHER VIOLENT TAIL WHIP foils his attack.
0: 
N: Gary and all of his extra pounds are thrown into the air
N: creating a big splash in the water!
0: 
N: Jonah, who couldn’t give a shit about him, is the first one
N: to assist.
0: 
C:                        JONAH
D:              Grab my hand!!
0: 
N: Gary and Jonah lock hands. Lisa and Omar help pull him back
N: onto the wing.
0: 
N: Kate finally gets to her feet.
0: 
N: This battle is far from over. The great white is like an
N: insane prisoner trying to escape a straightjacket. Little by
N: little he re-tears the tarp held together with the guitar
N: wire.
0: 
N: It will not hold much longer. Soon, its entire mouth will be
N: exposed!
0: 
N: But Ashley has also been driven to insanity and rage since
N: Jason’s death. She gathers her courage and despite her
N: wounded leg-
0: 
N: Dives towards the shark stabbing the flute into its head!
0: 
N: Then stabs again!! Blood flies everywhere! Then a third time
N: right in the eye!!!!
0: 
N: The animal contorts wildly... Ashley barely gets away...
0: 
N: The great white has shimmied itself all the way to the edge
N: of the wing and finally FALLS BACK IN THE WATER.
0: 
N: UNDERWATER
0: 
N: The flute still stuck in its eye, the shark twists and turns
N: trying to worm itself out of the life raft.
0: 
0: 
N: BACK ON THE WING
0: 
N: The passengers are stunned by Ashley’s attack.

0: 
0: 
N: The students are still dazed.
0: 
N: Ashley is still in shock, traumatized, and covered in blood.
N: She looks at her hands and can’t believe what she just did.
0: 
C:                     GARY
D:           You think it’s dead?
0: 
N: Lisa sees the rope stuck in the wing tighten several times.
0: 
C:                     LISA
D:           No. Not yet...
0: 
N: The shark is still alive.

C:                        GARY
D:           Oh no!
0: 
C:                        OMAR
D:           Watch it!!
0: 
N: Entangled in plastic and rope, the predator continues to
N: struggle, pulling on the wing making it sink into the water.
0: 
N: The castaways must hang on to the ledges so as not to
N: capsize.
0: 
N: Most lose their weapons and move to the opposite side hoping
N: to create a counterbalance. But they cannot prevent the wing
N: from rising above the water...
0: 
N: The wing continues tilting and moving...
0: 
N: The great white drags the entire wing through the water as it
N: struggles to free itself. But the more it twists, the more it
N: entangles itself...
0: 
N: The rope shortens and the shark reappears on the surface.
0: 
N: The castaways can see it below, half submerged, rolled up in
N: rope and plastic!
0: 
N: But the shark finally frees its muzzle!
0: 
N: Watching this develop from a tilting wing, the castaways
N: panic as they struggle to stay on.
0: 
N: Pam is the first to fall from the highest point- A ten feet
N: drop flat on her back... The two little girls follow,
N: screaming.
0: 
N: Lisa fights to keep from slipping down the wing. She can’t
N: hold on and slides straight into the sharks open mouth, when-
0: 0:                                                            93.
0: 
0: 
N: Luis grabs her hand in the nick of time!
0: 
N: Arm extended, Luis uses all his strength to keep Lisa alive.
0: 
N: It’s Gary’s turn to fall and he splashes next to Pam. With
N: his weight off the wing, it tilts even further...
0: 
N: Now it’s become impossible for anyone to hold on and they all
N: fall towards the shark, when--
0: 
N: The rope breaks!
0: 
N: The wing splashes back into the water! Another second and
N: they were all shark chum!!
0: 
N: But the splash down is brutal, and they all slam against the
N: metal dumbfounded.
0: 
N: Omar is the first to stand. He quickly goes to help Pam and
N: Gary out of the water.
0: 
C:                     PAM
D:           Take the girls first...
0: 
N: Omar pulls the two sisters back on the wing. The survivors
N: are exhausted, but they realize-
0: 
N: The shark is gone. They did it.
0: 
N: Or did they?
0: 
N: OUT OF NOWHERE, THE GREAT WHITE RESURFACES SURPRISING
N: EVERYONE!!
0: 
N: It lands with its face on the wing- Jaws wide open- 300 teeth
N: ready to finish them off once and for all.
0: 
N: Kate is in the wrong place at the wrong time and slides
N: towards the predator’s teeth!
0: 
N: There is nothing or anyone to hold her back. She manages to
N: grab the axe as-
0: 
N: She lands on the shark’s muzzle! Her feet resting on its
N: outer jaws...
0: 
N: Inches away, the rows of razor sharp teeth project outwards
N: reaching for her.
0: 
N: Maintaining her balance on the edge of its nose, Kate is
N: literally face to face with death!!
0: 
N: She hits the beast with the small axe multiple times. Cutting
N: through flesh like butter.
0: 0:                                                            94.
0: 
0: 
N: Gaping open cartilage into its perfect grey-white body. But
N: not stopping the three tons monster from attacking.
0: 
N: Avoiding another nasty bite, she drops the axe. Her survival
N: instinct kicking in, she rips the flute from its eye and
N: WEDGES IT UPRIGHT IN ITS MOUTH!
0: 
N: Having bought some time, she jumps off the shark.
0: 
N: However, it’s not in this animal’s DNA to give up, and it
N: snaps its jaws closed with extreme pressure.
0: 
N: But, instead of breaking the flute, it tears through the
N: shark, penetrating both ends of its head!
0: 
N: The shark stops instantly as if its brain had been hit.
0: 
N: Everyone looks on in disbelief.
0: 
N: Meanwhile Luis jumps in and swims to Kate’s rescue.
0: 
C:                     LUIS
D:           Kate! Kate! Are you alright?
0: 
N: She can only manage to nod, too exhausted to even talk.
0: 
N: Out of breath, they climb back on the wing to survey the dead
N: shark with the other passengers.
0: 
N: The marine monster rests partially on the wing wrapped in
N: rope and plastic tarp. Its head impaled with a silver flute.
0: 
N: Not only have they survived a plane crash, but they have also
N: survived the greatest shark attack ever caught on film!
0: 
N: The shark’s body slowly slides along the edge before slipping
N: into the water.
0: 
N: Suddenly it starts to wriggle... and then, all at once...
0: 
N: The carcass disgorges something out of its gaping wound...
0: 
N: Newborn sharks.
0: 
N: A dozen pups squirming free into the water, biting through
N: yolk sacs, almost immediately able to swim...
0: 
N: Submerging out of sight.
0: 
N: As the survivors stare with incredulity...
0: 0:                                                          95.

0: 
N: UNDERWATER
0: 
N: In slow motion, the mother predator glides towards the
N: abyss...
0: 
N: The wing floating above gets further away as the shark sinks
N: into the darkness.

0: 
N: BACK ON THE WING

C:                         JONAH
D:              I can’t believe we did it. We
D:              killed it.
0: 
N: Still, it’s a bittersweet victory.
0: 
N: They all know that their ordeal is far from over. If they
N: don’t get rescued soon, they’ll die regardless.
0: 
N: Luis falls to his knees close to Kate.
0: 
C:                        KATE
D:              Luis?
0: 
C:                        LUIS
D:              I’m fine. Don’t worry. Just a
D:              little spell. Nothing at all.
0: 
N: Omar and Kate share a look of concern. They both know that
N: without his medicine Luis will not last much longer.
0: 
N: After everything they’ve gone through, Luis can’t even stand.
N: He lays on the wing with his head resting on Kate’s knees.
0: 
N: Luis watches the last rays of sunlight disappearing into the
N: ocean. The music teacher enjoys every second of this
N: beautiful sight.
0: 
N: Kate caresses his hair...
0: 
C:                        KATE
D:              Do you remember what you were
D:              telling Lisa? “Fight”. Don’t you
D:              abandon us now, Luis.
0: 
N: Luis forces a smile and squeezes Kate’s hand, not sure if her
N: words will matter at this point.
0: 
N: The soft, warm light of sunset appears on their faces.
0: 
N: The purple, orange, and pink colors blend in a perfect
N: symphony, shimmering on the peaceful waters...

S: EXT. OCEAN - DAY
0: 
N: Luis is dead. He died in the middle of the night.
0: 
N: His lifeless body is watched over by his remaining students:
N: Lisa, Jonah and Ashley along with his survivors family: Kate,
N: Margo & Charlotte, Omar, Gary and Pam.
0: 
N: They share a tear in silence, holding hands. Lisa chokes up
N: wanting to say a few words-
0: 
C:                     LISA
D:           He... He would tell us that music
D:           puts us in harmony with everything
D:           around us. Music itself arises from
D:           the harmony between musicians when
D:           they cease to exist as individuals
D:           to play together in unison. Luis
D:           always knew how to create this
D:           harmony between people. To all of
D:           us, he was so much more than a
D:           teacher.

S: EXT. OCEAN - DAY
0: 
N: The next day, or maybe the day after.
0: 
N: A full sun blazes up above. The vastness of the blue sky
N: rivals that of the Pacific extending out as far as the eye
N: can see. In the middle, a white dot floats adrift.
0: 
N: The bodies of the sleeping castaways are sprawled about the
N: wing. Exhausted, dehydrated, and sunburnt skin, it’s hard to
N: tell the living from the dead.
0: 
N: Gary's hand drags across the surface of the water. His pruned
N: fingers move slowly in the relentless swell.
0: 
N: A slight hiss escapes Kate’s cracked lips. Is she still
N: breathing? Still alive?
0: 
N: Suddenly, a shadow casts across her face. It widens to cover
N: the entire wing and its passengers...
0: 0:                                                            97.
0: 
0: 
N: Muffled sounds of voices speaking a foreign language travel
N: in the breeze.
0: 
N: With great effort, Omar opens an eye to see a crew of
N: fishermen silhouetted by the sun above him.
0: 
N: Their trawler approaches the makeshift raft to rescue them.
0: 
N: Omar wants to scream and wake the others, but his throat is
N: too dry.
0: 
N: He reaches out to Kate and shakes her but she’s motionless.
N: He shakes her again-
0: 
N: Her eyeballs move slowly under her eyelids. In this sensory
N: fog, she discerns the face of A LITTLE GIRL leaning over her.
0: 
N: It’s Juliette, her daughter, who smiles tenderly and leans in
N: to whisper-
0: 
C:                     JULIETTE
D:           Wake up, mommy.
0: 
C:                     KATE
E:               (faint)
D:           Juliette...
0: 
N: She closes her eyes. But when she opens them again, she
N: realizes it’s Margo. The little girl is speaking again.
0: 
C:                     MARGO
D:           Wake up, Kate, wake up.
0: 
N: The little girl is shoving her, trying to wake her. Kate
N: turns her head to discover the silhouetted rescuers.
0: 
N: Kate is still. Unable to move. Unable to cry tears of joy.
N: But now she knows, from the bottom of her heart, that her
N: little girl is waiting for her mommy to come home.
