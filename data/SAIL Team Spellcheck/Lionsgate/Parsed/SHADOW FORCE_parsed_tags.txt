0: S: EXT. NEW YORK CITY HOTEL SUITE - DAY
0: 
N: WIDE On a high-end high-rise hotel suite on the city’s
N: upper west side. Suddenly A SNIPER RIFLE rises into
N: FRAME. Its SCOPE assuming our field of vision.
0: 
N: Blurred at first, then gradually focusing and bringing A
N: SHADOWY FIGURE into sharp refrain.
0: 
N: He’s in the corner room on the 15th floor. The windows
N: are smoked but his silhouette is very much visible.
0: 
N: The cross-hair reticle alights on his form. Tracking him
N: tightly. Assuming his movements around the room.
0: 
N: The SNIPER settles their weight into a bi-pod just off
N: the window sill. Shouldering the stock and steadying
N: their aim.
0: 
N: A GLOVED FINGER curls around the trigger.
0: 
N: A HAZEL EYE is magnified through the opposing end of the
N: scope. It appears to be female.
0: 
N: THE SHADOWY FIGURE moves purposely around the suite.

S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: The SHADOWY FIGURE, his back to us, is speaking to
N: someone on an encrypted cell. WE SEE a wide array of
N: military-grade WEAPONRY laid out, pre-action.
0: 
C:                        SHADOWY FIGURE
D:           I think I’ve found him. “Sombra” Bounty
D:           is still intact. 50 million for his head.

S: EXT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: Back in the sniper’s nest, tracking the Shadowy Figure.
0: 
N: A finger tightens over the trigger.
0: 
N: WE HEAR her draw in a deep, practiced, steady inhalation,
N: the reticle locking over the Figure’s moving form--
0: 
C:                        KID’S VOICE (V.O.)
D:           --POW--!
0: 
N: --A FLASH-- the window in the distance spiders. The
N: SHADOWY FIGURE crumbles, disappearing from the scope.

S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: The Figure lies prone. Shot dead.
0: 
C:                        KID’S VOICE (V.O.)
D:           POW! POW!

N: ON SCREEN WE READ:
0: 
C: NAME: KYLE ANSLOW
C: CODE NAME: “ALOKA”
C: STATUS: DECEASED
D: A PHOTO remains locked in “Aloka’s” grip: A handsome,

S: INT. MODEST HOME - MORNING
0: 
N: KY SHIELDS, 5, runs around with his arms stretched out in
N: front of him and an ACTION FIGURE, gripped in each hand.
0: 
C:                        KID’S VOICE
D:           POW! POW!
0: 
N: He clashes the man and woman action figures together--
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           --BAM! BAM! BAM!
0: 
N: He runs into DAVID SHIELDS, late 30’s, his father...and
N: we realize right away that this is the same man we saw in
N: the shadowy figure’s photo.
0: 
N: David possesses all the outward pleasantries of a mild-
N: mannered, fatherly figure but we sense something
N: deliberately contained beneath it...something dark and
N: dangerous that he let go and left behind, long ago...
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           Whoa! Watch it Batman.
0: 
N: He scoops up his son with a big smile.
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           I’m not Batman, Dad! I’m Black Panther.
E:                  (holds female figure up)
D:           And this is Momma!
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           Momma’s fighting Black Panther?

0: 
C:                        KY
D:           Black Panther tried to find Momma and she
D:           didn’t like that, so she’s fighting him!
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           What was Black Panther thinking?
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           I don’t know but Momma’s mad!
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           And Momma’s stronger than Black Panther.
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           She is!?
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           Mm-hmm. Stronger and better and faster!
0: 
N: Ky stares in wonder at the female action figure in his
N: hand as David sets him down at the kitchen table.
0: 
C:                        DAVID (CONT’D)
D:           So what do you want for dinner?
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           Marshmallows!
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           Who eats marshmallows for dinner?
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           Cool dads!
0: 
C:                        DAVID
E:                  (cackles at that response)
D:           Well I’m the coolest dad ever and I’ve
D:           never made Marshmallows for dinner. How
D:           about steak?
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           Then Marshmallows?
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           If you eat your steak.
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           Can we burn them in the fire?
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           Roast them in the fire, bud. Roast. Sure.

0: 
N: Ky nods and resumes battering the action figures off of
N: one another while providing that rambling, impossible to
N: follow play-by-play only a 5 year old mind can conjure.
0: 
N: David then notices a bruise on the back of Ky’s neck.
0: 
C:                        DAVID (CONT’D)
D:           Hey, what’s that?
0: 
N: Ky whirls in circles with his action figures, shrieking--
0: 
C:                        DAVID (CONT’D)
D:           --Ky, hey, c’mere--
0: 
N: --David draws Ky over to him, interrupting his play--
0: 
C:                        DAVID (CONT’D)
D:           --What is that? That bruise? On the back
D:           on your neck?
0: 
N: Ky’s little face, already flushed with effort, darkens
N: still. His breathing slows, he casts his eyes down.
0: 
C:                        DAVID (CONT’D)
D:           Ky?
0: 
N: Ky stares at his feet for a moment.
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           Lonnie hit me.
0: 
N: David examines the bruise.
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           Did you tell your teacher?
0: 
N: Ky shakes his head “no”.
0: 
C:                        DAVID (CONT’D)
D:           Why not?
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           He said if I did, he would hit me harder.
0: 
N: David, his jaw tightening as he nods to himself and pulls
N: his son into a brief but reassuring embrace.
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           Ok. Why don’t you go get washed up.
D:           Dinner will be ready in a minute.

0: 
0: 
N: David abruptly tickle-seizes his son, sending Ky into
N: hysterics as he squirms from his father’s grasp--
0: 
C:                        DAVID
E:                  (laughing along with Ky)
D:           --When it’s ready! How ‘bout it!
0: 
N: Ky continues to squeal with laughter as David upends him
N: and hangs him upside down, still tickling him.
0: 
C:                        KY
E:                  (between fits of laughter)
D:           Stop Daddy! I can’t breathe!
0: 
N: David sets Ky down, who weaves unsteadily as his father
N: gently ushers him off toward the bathroom.
0: 
N: David stews, staring off, cracking his knuckles -force of
N: habit- one by one...

S: EXT. MODEST HOME - MORNING
0: 
N: The type of bland, homogenized neighborhood you only see
N: in stock real estate photos.
0: 
N: A generically pleasant suburban housing tract...Every
N: home a cookie-cutter of the one preceding it.
0: 
N: David and Ky rush toward his car, a beat-up grey Pontiac
N: parked in the driveway.

S: INT. DAVID’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

C:                        DAVID
D:           What are you feeling like today, bud?
0: 
C:                        KY
E:                  (no hesitation)
D:           Lionel Richie! Or The Commodores!
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           Those are basically the same thing, son.
D:           How about some Curtis Mayfield or Prince--
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           --What’s a “Brick House” Dad?
0: 
N: David stammers, can’t think of an quick response.

0: 
C:                        KY
D:           A “Brick House”. They say “thirty-six,
D:           twenty-four, thirty six.” What’s that?
0: 
N: David, struggling, mightily...

C:                        DAVID

D:           Really?
0: 
N: David sighs, decides to level...gotta-learn-sometime-son.
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           Actually buddy, no, a uh, a “Brick House”
D:           is a term for a very beautiful, very
D:           curvaceous woman.
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           Oh...What’s “Curvaceous”.

E:                  (now he’s struggling)
D:           Uhh. Um...
E:                  (aside, to himself)
D:           ...dammit, why did I use that word.
0: 
N: Then--

C:                        KY
D:           --Like boobies?

0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           And, mm-hmm, both those things. Yes.
E:                  (phew, moving on)
D:           Ok, so can Dad pick the music today, or--

D:           Ok, Lionel Richie. We-love-Lionel-Richie.
0: 
N: David dials up his “LIONEL RICHIE” playlist and starts
N: thumb scrolling songs. He pauses at “TRULY”, considers
N: it...but something about this song gives him pause...
0: 
N: ...and he scrolls past, punches another selection and
N: “SAIL ON” begins. Ky starts singing along, word-for-word.
N: The boy’s got some pipes and Dad is duly impressed!

C:                        DAVID (CONT’D)

N: Little boys playing basketball, which looks a lot more

D:           If he played tough, he wouldn’t be

D:           I think you heard every word, bro.
E:                  (beat, turning back)
D:           Your kid can’t play.
0: 
N: The gathered parents titter nervously against the rising
N: tension. Meathead exults his own son as a plus-sized kid
N: with a bleach-blonde faux-hawk, brings the ball up court.

D:           I think you heard every word, bro.
0: 
N: Meathead lunges to his feet, clambering up the bleachers
N: so aggressively that gasps escape more than one parent in
N: anticipation of something horrible about to happen.
0: 
N: David doesn’t budge, gazing up into this violent, vein-
N: bulged visage BOOMING down at him like a bull-horn--

C:                        MEATHEAD DAD
D:           --C’MON! TALK SHIT NOW, BITCH!!
0: 
N: David lowers his eyes-- a gesture which creates the same
N: immediate dread as a shark’s fin breaking the surface.
0: 
N: Meathead is perplexed, put off, trying to look tough but
N: realizing he’s wandered in too deep. David glowers up.
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           If your son, lays another hand on my boy,
D:           then you and I wi--
0: 
N: --Now David realizes that the game has ground to a halt
N: as most of the gathered crowd, as well as the kids on the
N: floor, are focused on this confrontation in the stands.
0: 
N: Meathead realizes that this lapse works in his favor,
N: then sees David’s gaze soften and seizes on this shift.
0: 
C:                        MEATHEAD DAD
D:           I’ll beat your ass right here.

N: Ky can feel his father’s vibrating anger as they walk
N: toward their car and wants only to alleviate it.

D:           Yeah, I know.

C:                        KY
D:           Is he an asshole too?
0:

N: David finishes shaving, shirtless. His upper body is
N: criss-crossed with keloid scarring and covered with what
N: appears to be ancient puncture wounds, healed over ugly.
0: 
N: WE SEE two small EARBUD IMPLANTS on the sink basin that
N: David gingerly slips into each ear.
0: 
N: Ky sit in the bathtub, absently playing with his action
N: figures, his mind more on his father’s scarring...
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           Dad, how’d you get the scars? Was it the

0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           Yeah. It was the bad guys.
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           And they hurt your ears too? With

D:           Mm-hmm.
0: 
N: David’s eyes glaze over as he gazes off at some
N: indeterminate point in his past...as this is a story that
N: he’s told and retold but one that he seems to still
N: relish telling, all the same...
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           ...So we know about the bad guys and the
D:           ‘splosions and why daddy’s ears don’t
D:           work, right?
0: 
C:                          KY
D:           Right.
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           So when momma was pregnant with you, she
D:           used to lay daddy down in her lap, right
D:           on her tummy, so I could feel you move
D:           but sometimes, you wouldn’t move.

N: softly, rhythmically...
0: 
C:                        DAVID (CONT’D)
D:           ...and that’s how Daddy could hear your

N: He checks the time on his phone: 4:03 AM. He closes his
N: eyes, only to reopen them a second later...his mind a
N: million miles away from this moment.
0: 
N: He retrieves his Earbud Implants from the nightstand and
N: plugs them in, connecting the Bluetooth. The previous

D:           A “Disclosure Fee”?
0: 
C:                        TELLER
D:           It’s a small charge that the bank levies
D:           for teller/client interaction.
0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           I don’t-- what does that mean? I’m not
D:           trying to be difficult here, Miss. I’m
D:           just seeing all these fees and I can’t
D:           make sense of them. So, the “disclosure
D:           fee” covers...?

0: 
C:                        DAVID
D:           Right, or as it’s commonly referred to,

D:           charge you more for your burger, because

E:                  (off her non-reaction)

0: 
0: 
N: Precise, practiced, movements, mastered over years of
N: combat and engagement.
0: 
N: He sweeps room to room, pure stealth, pistol leading.
0: 
N: He reaches the living room and flips the lights on.
0: 
N: Nothing.
0: 
N: He walks over to the floorboard, it’s been moved--
0: 
N: --Suddenly the pistol is kicked out of his hand from
N: behind.
0: 
N: He turns and gets cracked in the face by a masked
N: intruder with HAZEL EYES.
0: 
N: She attacks with a steady combo of blows to the head and
N: body, each punch with pop and purpose and vicious intent.
0: 
N: David, on his back foot, trying to defend himself, is
N: caught completely off guard this aggression.
0: 
N: He’s able to block and parry while getting his bearings,
N: but is being steadily backed across the living room as he
N: attempts to weather and withstand this assault.
0: 
N: These barrages are thrown with a fury and anger that
N: seems intensely personal.
0: 
N: Now David launches his counter-attack and they really go
N: at it, both of them equally skilled and evenly matched: A
N: full on, expertly fought brawl between two combatants
N: that seem to mirror and mimic one another’s movements--
0: 
N: --then Hazel Eyes lands a spinning round house kick and
N: follows it up by sweeping David’s legs and taking his
N: balance, putting him flat on his back.
0: 
N: Hazel Eyes mounts him, ripping her mask off...and WE
N: RECOGNIZE this woman immediately as KYRAH OWENS.
0: 
C:                         KYRAH
D:            How could you put him in danger?!

N: David stares up at her, this look of regret and sadness,
N: until he moves, whiplash fast, executing a maneuver that
N: reverses their positions and puts him on top of her.

D:            Where the hell have you been?

N: and then rolls him over, going for an arm-bar submission.

N: him like he’s going to power-bomb her into the floor.

C:                        DAVID
D:           Then what the fuck are we doing here!?
0: 
N: She immediately releases her hold and bounces back to her
N: feet, her hands raised in a traditional guard, her front
N: leg slightly aloft as she advances in a Muay-Thai stance.
0: 
N: They’re both ready to launch into one another anew when
N: they notice--
0: 
N: --KY. Standing there. Slack-jawed. Staring at both of
N: them, his action figures frozen in either hand.
0: 
N: The sight of her son immediately cancels whatever anger
N: and aggression she’s feeling. Tears slowly fills her eyes
N: as she crosses over to Ky and kneels down.
0: 
N: Mother and son regard one another for a sustained moment.
0: 
N: Ky looks at Kyrah for a long time, this small smile
N: forming as he utters the following, whisper-quiet...

C:                        KY
D:           ...I like your face. It’s pretty.
0: 
N: Kyrah smiles, releasing tears. She reaches out and
N: touches her son’s cheek now, softly stroking it.
0: 
C:                        KYRAH
D:           I like yours too. It’s handsome.

D:           Why did you fight my dad?

N: Kyrah shoots a side-eye at David, then returns her gaze
N: to Ky, placing her hands on his shoulders and squeezing,
N: looking nervous and unsettled, her voice warbling...
0: 
C:                        KYRAH
D:           ...do you know who I am, honey?
0: 
N: Ky searches her face, his gaze playing over her features
N: carefully, processing something-- then his gaze abruptly
N: shifts down to the female ACTION FIGURE he’s holding in
N: his hand, before returning at Kyrah...
0: 
N: ...who looks exactly like the action figure.
0: 0:                                                          47.
0: 
0: 
N: This gasping, gobsmacked realization comes over Ky and
N: those little eyes beam back at her now, spellbound...
0: 
N: ...then he touches her face and says in a voice that
N: reminds Kyrah that there is indeed a God...
0: 
C:                          KY
D:           ...Momma?
0: 
N: She nods. Tears fall. Ky, marveling at the sight of
N: “momma”, collapses into her all at once, his little frame
N: melting into her as he begins to buck and sob...
0: 
C:                        KYRAH
D:           ...Don’t cry baby, it’s ok.
E:                  (reassuring, soothing)
D:           I’m here...Momma’s here.

D:           defense spending was either frozen or
D:           stripped from Cinder, after we fled?
D:           Shadow Force went dark, because of US.
E:                  (beat, understand this)

E:                  (beat, reminding him)
D:           What did we decide? That Shadow Force was
D:           being politicized. That there was no room
D:           for us anymore. That Cinder was turning

0: 
N: David, miserable now, swipes one of his earbuds on the

N: steady thrum of ROTORS rise as a CHOPPER approaches.

D:           Come on, let’s move.
0: 
N: David tosses the flare in the water, extinguishing it as
N: they hustle Ky to the treeline at the edge of the lake.
0: 
N: Kyrah snaps back around-- their footprints are visible in
N: the snow, leading away from the lake--
0: 
N: --She debates what do but is forced to duck into the
N: dense forest as the chopper arrives--

E:                  (realizing)
D:           Shit...
0: 
N: Both of them instinctively go for their 9mm sidearms.
N: They drop their clips and jack the slides. Clearing the
N: lake water from both the barrel and the firing mechanism.
0: 
N: The chopper circles, its searchlight strafing the surface
N: of the frozen lake, searching...
0: 
N: At that moment ENEMY VEHICLES arrive en masse at the edge
N: of hillside. FIGURES disembark. Floodlights pan and arc
N: over the scene.
0: 
N: David, Kyrah and Ky huddle in the heavy brush, watching
N: as the chopper’s rotor wash scatters the accumulated snow
N: from the lake’s surface and erases their footprints.
0: 
N: David draws them deeper into the brush, away from the
N: lakeside. Kyrah shrugs free, drawing her FN F2000 up and
N: taking aim on the hillside, gazing through the scope--

C:                        DAVID (CONT’D)
D:           --Kyrah, what are you doing?

D:           Kyrah?

N: Kyrah settles into the weapon now, nuzzling it tight, eye
N: tight to the scope, aim traveling over her former
N: teammates, the crosshairs alighting on each, momentarily.
0: 
C:                        KYRAH
E:                  (with grim resolve)

E:                  (whispering to her now)

D:           and if even if you capped all five, what
D:           about the rest of them?
0: 
N: Kyrah agonizes, every part of her wanting to pull that
N: trigger and take her chances...then she feels a tug at
N: her waist and looks down. Ky stares up, his voice low.
0: 
C:                        KY
D:           Momma? Are you ok?
0: 
N: Kyrah chokes back a sob before shouldering the weapon and
N: scooping him up into her arms. David leads them through
N: the undergrowth as the chopper’s searchlight finally
N: finds the hole-in-the-ice.
0: 
N: The chopper holds a tight orbit above as WE SEE the armed
N: convoy on the hillside begin to descend down.

S: INT. CAVE - LATER

D:           Now who’s making it worse?
0:

D:           ...I missed you, so much...

N: harder, heavier.
0: 
N: He pulls her to him now and they entwine quietly, simply,
N: nothing forced, nothing rushed, every breath seemingly
N: synced to this perfect radiance passing between them.
0: 
N: Their eyes lock...and they feel their souls touch...at
N: once familiar and frightening...

N: away as they disappear into one another...

D:           There’s a notion that with success comes
