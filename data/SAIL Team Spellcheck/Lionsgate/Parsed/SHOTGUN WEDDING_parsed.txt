T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. PRIVATE ISLAND. PHILIPPINES - NIGHT
N: We see a festive tiki torch-lit cocktail party from afar. * We’re on the dark docks across the island where a big sign reads: “Amanpulo Island Resort.” A SHADOWY FIGURE sneaks onto the docks and kneels beside a covered boat. He unties the tarp and slides it off like a dress, revealing a gorgeous 1973 Riva Aquarama speedboat. The mystery man unzips a duffel bag and gets to work.
S: INT. GUARD’S STATION - NIGHT *
N: A Filipino SECURITY GUARD sees movement on one of the boats. * He gulps and his eyes flick to a bulletin board of WANTED posters of known pirates... printed in five languages and stamped with the logo of the Philippine Navy.
S: EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT
N: The Guard creeps along the dark dock, Beretta M9 in hand.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Freeze!
E: in Filipino
N: The FIGURE on the back of the boat panics, stumbles back and falls overboard with a SPLASH! The Guard runs to switch on a FLOODLIGHT and sees: The vintage speedboat is now decked out with white streamers and wood letters spelling “Just Married.”
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: I almost shoot you! I thought you * were pirate! But you’re just a guy. *
E: CONT'D laughing his ass off
N: TOM FOWLER, a charmingly neurotic Midwestern baseball player, * pulls himself onto the dock in his soaking wet suit. *
C: TOM *
D: Yep, just a guy. *
N: Tom grabs a towel from the dock and dries himself off. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 2.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Aww, this is for your bride? *
C: TOM
D: Yeah, it’s a surprise. What do you * think? *
C: SECURITY GUARD *
D: It’s nice! *
C: TOM *
D: You think? Are the decorations too * corny-- or corny in a fun way? I * mean, it is our wedding, might as * well go all out, right? I want it * feel festive and romantic-- but not * cheesy or generic, y’know? *
C: SECURITY GUARD *
D: * It’s nice! *
E: same tone
N: Tom checks his phone and sees the time: 8:13. Shit. *
C: TOM *
D: I have to go.
S: INT. BEACH - NIGHT *
N: CLOSE ON a phone screen with an unsent text that reads: “Tom, * where are you??” The text is stuck in SENDING mode. * WIDEN TO REVEAL the phone is in an outstretched hand, * reaching as high as it can go, trying to get service. The * hand belongs to our bride GRACE RIVERA, confident, dynamic, * and currently stressed the hell out. * She checks the status of the text: Unsent. *
C: GRACE *
D: Damn it. *
N: Grace takes a deep breath to center herself and then flips * around, walking up the sand toward: *
S: EXT. POOLSIDE COCKTAIL PARTY - CONTINUOUS *
N: A wedding welcome party in full swing. From Grace’s POV, each * guest waves and smiles at her. She’s the star of the night. * ON GRACE as she scans the crowd, looking for Tom. She greets * people as she passes. She hates this, but she’s good at it. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 3.
C: GRACE *
D: Gloria, hi! Welcome! * * Uncle Benny! You made it! * * Peter! Looking sharp. * * Youuuu, sir! Hello! *
E: then, waving waving squints, not remembering * someone’s name
N: RENEE ORTIZ (Grace’s mother, impossibly glamorous and highly * critical) hooks arms with Grace, pulling her toward the bar. *
C: RENEE *
D: Where have you been? *
C: GRACE *
D: I was taking a moment, Mom. Is that * allowed? *
C: RENEE *
D: Not at your wedding, no. I need you * to talk to your father’s * girlfriend. *
C: GRACE *
D: Wife. *
C: RENEE
D: --Whatever. She keeps smiling at me. Can you tell her to stop * smiling at me?
C: GRACE *
D: Sure. I’ll tell Dad’s wife to stop * smiling at you. That won’t cause any issues.
N: They land at the bar and Renee drops her empty martini glass * as the bartender immediately passes her a full one. *
C: RENEE *
D: * Thank you, Jerome. * * So where’s the groomzilla? *
E: to bartender then, to Grace

E: MORE
N: Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 4.
C: RENEE
D: You know if you took your dad’s * money for this wedding, you could * have paid someone to do that. *
E: CONT'D

D: We wanted to pay for it ourselves * so this wedding could be about us * and what we wanted. *
C: RENEE *
D: And this is what you wanted? *
N: Renee holds up a cocktail napkin printed with a photo of * Grace and Tom, stretched to odd proportions. *
C: GRACE *
D: * Those were Tom’s idea and... I love * them. They are perfect. *
E: selling too hard
C: RENEE
D: Have you finished the seating chart * for tomorrow yet? Because I can’t sit at a table with Tom’s mother. * On the boat over here she tried to * get everyone to do sing-a-long to * South Pacific. *

E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: Carol! *
E: CONT'D
N: CAROL FOWLER (Tom’s mother, a bubbly over-talker in a loud * Hawaiian-print dress) has come up behind Renee. *
C: CAROL *
D: * I’m gonna wash that man right out * of my hair * And send him on his way! * * Kidding! Please don’t leave my son. *

C: GRACE *
D: Wasn’t planning on it! *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 5.
C: CAROL *
D: Ahh, I can’t get over this resort! * I’ve never been on a private island * before. Matter of fact, I’ve never * been on any island before. * * Oh actually we used to go to * Mackinac with the Hilbermans before * they moved to Bloomington. Have you * ever been to Mackinac, Renee? *
E: then, considering
C: RENEE *
D: I don’t know what that is or most * of the words you just said. *
C: CAROL *
D: Mackinac Island on Lake Michigan! * You would love it. Wouldn’t she * love it, Larry? *
N: REVEAL LARRY (Tom’s dad, quiet, agreeable) standing next to * Carol, busy shooting the party on his outdated video camera. *
C: LARRY *
D: Hi, Grace. Hi, Renee. *
N: Larry returns to filming. Carol hands Grace a present. *
C: CAROL

C: GRACE *
D: Oh, you didn’t have to--
C: CAROL
D: Open it! * * Larry, she’s opening. *

C: WAITER
D: Oh someone just left that in the bathroom.
C: GRACE *
D: That’s fine. Thank you.
N: She downs it in one gulp. Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 6.
S: EXT. JUNGLE PATH - NIGHT
N: MARGE, the small buff Filipina owner of the resort, drives Tom in a SPEEDING GOLF CART as he changes into dry clothes. We see a farmer’s tan and a blurry old Detroit Tigers tattoo.
C: TOM
D: Marge, you are a lifesaver.
C: MARGE
D: Part of the job. Don’t worry. * Everyone is happy. Grace is talking * to your mother.
N: Tom pokes his head through a shirt, EYES PANICKED--
C: TOM
D: How fast can you go?
S: EXT. POOLSIDE COCKTAIL PARTY - NIGHT
N: Grace opens the gift: A tacky bridal CAKE KNIFE SET covered * in white bows. Renee looks baffled. *
C: RENEE *
D: You got my daughter... lacy knives? *
C: GRACE *
D: They’re for the wedding cake, Mom! * * They’re so-- just-- look at them! *
E: trying hard
C: CAROL *
D: It’s your “something borrowed”! * Everyone in our family uses them on * their wedding day. They bring good * luck. Except for poor Uncle Greg * who was indicted for check fraud. * But that’s not the knives’ fault! *
C: GRACE *
D: * Thank you! *
E: unsure what to say
N: ROBERT RIVERA (Grace’s dad, an impressive, charming man in a * designer suit) approaches. He kisses Grace on both cheeks. *
C: ROBERT *
D: Mijita! Estas preciosa! * * Carol! Lovely to see you! * * Larry! How are you? *
E: then, kissing Carol then, kissing Larry
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 7. He then pivots to see Renee, who backs away one step. *
C: ROBERT
D: Renee.
E: CONT'D
C: RENEE
D: Robert.
C: CAROL *
D: It’s wonderful you two are still * friends. Our neighbors Darlene and * Phil divorced and it tore up our * book club. Can’t imagine if they * were stuck on an island together. *
N: Carol laughs. Everyone else smiles. Grace is in hell. * HARRIETT (40s, bohemian chic, spends lots of time to look * effortless) floats up, handing a cocktail to Robert. *
C: CAROL *
D: Oh, you must be Robert’s wife. *
E: CONT'D
N: Harriett kisses Robert for way too long before responding. *
C: HARRIETT * Harriett. A pleasure. *
D: * Gracie... *
E: then, noticing Grace
N: Harriett holds Grace in an intimate hug she did not want. *
C: HARRIETT *
D: * I am so honored to be here and bare * witness to this sacred observance * of devotion and rebirth. *
E: CONT'D whispered, mid-hug
C: GRACE *
D: Same. *
N: Harriett breaks out of the hug and warmly smiles at Renee. *
C: RENEE
D: Please stop smiling at me. *
C: GRACE *
D: Mom! *
C: RENEE *
D: I need to use the lady’s room. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 8.
C: CAROL *
D: Me too! Look at us Moms-In-Law * syncing up. *
N: Renee tries to hurry away alone but Carol catches up. Larry * wanders off, filming the crowd. * The RESORT GOLF CART SPEEDS OVER and Tom jumps out before it stops. He’s now under-dressed in a corduroy sport coat. Grace sees him, and he smiles at her. He still has the power * to knock her off her feet, even at her most annoyed. He * steals two wine glasses and joins his fiancée. *
C: TOM
D: There’s my beautiful bride. This is * for youuu.
N: Grace takes both the glasses of wine from Tom. He stiffens up * when he sees Robert and extends his hand for a handshake. *
C: TOM *
D: Robert-- my good man-- my future * father-in-law-- my-- sir. *
E: CONT'D
C: ROBERT *
D: Thomas. *
C: TOM *
D: I trust you and Harriett made it * here safely. *
C: ROBERT *
D: We are here, aren’t we? *
C: HARRIETT *
D: Tom, you are glowing. The energy * radiating off of you is electric. *
C: ROBERT *
D: I need another drink. Graciela, * otra bebida? *
N: Grace holds up her drinks and shakes her head no. Robert * walks off with Harriett. *
C: TOM *
D: I think he’s warming up to me. *
C: GRACE *
D: Where have you been? You left me * alone. In the middle of our rehearsal dinner.
E: MORE
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 9.
C: GRACE
D: I told you the only way I was going to get through this is if we stay together, and then you disappear... *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: I know, but it was half an hour. What can happen in a half an hour?
C: GRACE
D: Your mom gave me cursed knives, my * dad fully frenched Harriett, and * your cousin asked where she could * charge her vibrator-- *
C: TOM *
D: Oh cousin Amy? Yeah, she’s a creep. *
C: GRACE *
D: Why is your hair wet? *
C: TOM *
D: I... went for a quick moonlight * swim. It’s good for stress relief. *
C: GRACE *
D: You fell in the water, didn’t you? *
C: TOM
D: Yeah, I fell in. *
C: GRACE *
D: * It’s cute how bad you are at lying. *
E: smiling
C: TOM
D: Thank you? *
N: Grace kisses him tenderly. A brief intimate moment. *
C: GRACE *
D: Promise not to let go of my hand * the rest of the night. *
C: TOM
D: Promise. *
N: Just then, Tom’s whiskey-breathed teammate RICKY interrupts them. He’s one of those friends you have to constantly apologize for. Sometimes to police officers.
C: RICKY
D: Grace, I need your man. You look * hot, by the way. Usually you look like a lawyer. You know?
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 10.
C: GRACE *
D: I am a lawyer, Ricky.
C: RICKY *
D: I thought you were a do-gooder. *
C: GRACE *
D: I run a legal non-profit for low- * income families. *
N: Ricky stares blankly for a moment, then: *
C: RICKY *
D: You lost me. * * I gotta talk to you, bud. It’s an * emergency!
E: then, to Tom
N: Ricky corrals Tom away, breaking Tom’s hand away from * Grace’s. She sighs. Alone again. * Her younger sister JAMIE (mid 30s, a New York Cool Girl with * a deadpan demeanor) walks up drinking a tropical cocktail. *
C: JAMIE
D: Harriett just asked me what my Love * Language is. She sucks. *
C: GRACE *
D: I thought you were into that sort * of thing. *
C: JAMIE *
D: I am. My Love Language is Gifts. * But when it comes from her, I hate * it. *
C: GRACE *
D: Yeah, I don’t love her, she’s got * those vacant cult eyes. But she * makes Dad happy so let’s just-- *
C: JAMIE *
D: * God, cell service here is terrible. *
E: checking her phone
C: GRACE *
D: Well, we are on a remote island in * the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Do * you have any more complaints? *
C: JAMIE *
D: I know you mean that rhetorically * but this cocktail is very weak. *
N: Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 11. Grace sighs and takes a swig of her drink. * MEANWHILE, Ricky lights two cigars and passes one to Tom. *
C: RICKY *
D: Dude, this island is unreal. How * did you afford it? I know how much * you make and it sucks. *
C: TOM *
D: We got a deal. Cut some corners. * * So what’s the emergency, Ricky? *
E: impatient
C: RICKY *
D: I’m working on my best man speech and I can’t remember the name of that girl you dated at Spring Training who called your dick “Short Stop”--
C: TOM
D: You don’t need to mention that... * Maybe give me a copy of your speech * and I can do a quick edit. *
C: RICKY
D: Tom, you gotta relax. Pro-tip? Make * love BEFORE the wedding. Takes the * pressure off. I should know. *
C: TOM
D: You got divorced twice.
C: RICKY
D: Yeah but the weddings were great. * Speaking of, any women here single? *
C: TOM *
D: No. *
C: RICKY *
D: You’re lying. *
C: TOM *
D: Damn it. *
N: Suddenly, they hear a DEAFENING NOISE as a ISLAND HOPPER * HELICOPTER coming in for landing. It blows napkins and hats away. Makes waves in the pool. Everyone watches with fascination as it touches down and out of the cockpit hops SEAN HAWKINS in a billowing khaki shirt. Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 12.
C: JAMIE
D: You invited Sean? Wow, did he get * hotter since you dumped him? He * looks like he’s leading a porn safari.
N: Grace rushes over to Tom, who is downing his drink. *
C: GRACE *
D: I didn’t think he’d actually come. * He never RSVP’d! *
C: TOM *
D: Which was a very cool move. Excited * to finally meet him. Oops, I guess * he was in a rush and forgot to button his shirt all the way up.
N: ANGLE ON Sean as he kisses Harriett’s cheek, then bear-hugs * Robert. They lock in a deep embrace. *
C: TOM
D: Why is he hugging your dad? Wow, they’re, like, really hugging. Did your dad just smell his neck? *
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: After we broke up they just kinda * became friends? Sean stays with my * dad when he’s in New York. They * FaceTime a lot. It’s weird. *
C: TOM *
D: Awesome, love that for them. *
N: Grace and Tom approach Sean. He swoops Grace in his arms, * picking her up effortlessly and spinning her around. *
C: SEAN
D: Gracie... Hi. Sorry I didn’t RSVP. * I never know where I’m going to be month to month. I was in Tokyo last * minute closing a deal and there was * a mix-up with the jet guy I use in * Japan-- it’s a whole boring thing. *
C: GRACE *
D: It’s okay. Glad you could make it. * It’s been--
C: SEAN
D: A long time. But wow. You look the * same. More stunning even. I didn’t * think it was possible. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 13. Sean looks deeply into Grace’s eyes. *
C: TOM
D: So how long do the spinn-y things on your helicopter keep going? *
C: SEAN *
D: You must be Gracie’s ball player! *
C: ROBERT
D: Actually Tom’s season ended and his * contract hasn’t been renewed yet. * So technically, he’s unemployed. *
C: TOM *
D: That’s right, sir. Thank you for * clarifying. *
N: Tom downs the rest of his drink in one gulp. *
C: GRACE *
D: * Is it time for dinner? I’m gonna * check if it’s time for dinner. *
E: strained
S: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
N: Guests sit down for a rehearsal dinner set up on the beach. * Grace stands, holding a microphone. *
C: GRACE *
D: Thank you all for coming. I know it * was a long trip. We really wanted * to pick a place that was convenient for none of you. *
N: People laugh, seated at long tables under twinkly lights. *
C: GRACE *
D: But I spend too much time talking * at work, so I’m going to hand it * over to my fiancé Tom. *
E: CONT'D
N: Tom pulls out notecards and cues up a SLIDESHOW behind them: * IMAGES of Tom in his baseball uniform with Grace in a fancy * suit. Different worlds but they seem so happy and carefree. *
C: TOM *
D: Thank you all for coming. It was * such a long trip-- * * Oh, um, Grace covered that part. *
E: then, realizing
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 14. Tom starts getting flustered. He skips to his next notecard. *
C: GRACE *
D: It’s okay, baby, you got this. *
C: TOM *
D: Grace always talked about her time * in the Peace Corps in Bali. And I * thought, how cool would it be to * get married there? But turns out * Bali is un-Bali-vably expensive. *
N: Crickets. Carol throws out a sympathy laugh. *
C: TOM *
D: But I think the Philippines are * better anyway!
E: CONT'D
N: The tattooed Filipino guy roasting the pig gives a thumbs up. This is ACE, 50s.
C: TOM
D: See? Ace agrees! * * So I know a lot of you were there * to witness my proposal. *
E: CONT'D back to notes
N: SLIDE: Tom down on one knee in his baseball uniform, * proposing to Grace on a baseball mound in front of a crowd. *
C: TOM *
D: And it means the world that you’re * here to watch us seal the deal. * Mom, Dad, you’ve been married 40 years, and your love and commitment to one another is an inspiration. * Robert. Renee... We hope our marriage is nothing like yours!
E: CONT'D
N: Scattered laughs. Grace covers by laughing too much. Tom, now * in panic sweats, sees Renee scowling. He backpedals. *
C: TOM *
D: To be clear, you’re wonderful * individually, but as a couple, * yikes... which isn’t a character * judgement! 50 percent of marriages-- *
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: * Keep moving, honey... *
E: gentle hand on his back
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 15.
C: TOM *
D: Anyhoo. Enjoy the food! And the * open bar. It wasn’t cheap! Mm-kay. *
N: Tom awkwardly salutes and sits down. Everyone stares, * uncertain whether his speech is over. Grace grabs the mic. *
C: GRACE *
D: Ha. Wonderful. Cheers everybody! *
N: Everyone clinks glasses as the slide show ends, showing a * giant disorganized home screen. *
C: TOM
D: I did not nail that. *
C: GRACE *
D: No, it was really fun!
E: high-pitched
N: Tom looks out: Renee glares at Harriett. Robert wipes his * mouth on the Grace & Tom cocktail napkin. Larry is asleep in * his chair, but still recording. *
C: TOM
D: I’m gonna fix this. I promise.
N: Then a KNIFE CLINKS A GLASS:
C: SEAN
D: So I met Gracie in the Peace Corps * in Bali and one day, we had to take * some medical supplies to a village on this little cigarette boat.
N: The guests are riveted.
C: SEAN
D: I decide to teach her to drive the boat, so I can get some sleep and she can do all the work. This boat was a beast. I was worried. Turns out I was right to * be, because the first time our girl is behind the wheel... she gets a damn speeding ticket from the Balinese coast guard! *
E: CONT'D laughter
N: Lots of laughs. Grace laughs, transported by the memory. *
C: SEAN
D: That’s when I learned, Gracie * doesn’t do anything halfway.
E: CONT'D MORE
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 16.
C: SEAN
D: Most people read an article about problems in Detroit, feel sad for a minute and move on... but Gracie * reads that article and moves to * Detroit to start a non-profit. Most * people meet a guy like Tom, feel sad for a minute and move on. But Gracie marries him! *
E: CONT'D
N: Everyone laughs, but Robert laughs hard. Tom clocks this. *
C: SEAN
D: Hey. I think some of you might know that a hundred years ago, Gracie * and I were engaged... but then she * called it off. *
E: CONT'D
N: General “Aww’s” of sympathy.
C: SEAN
D: No, it’s okay. She must have been * waiting for Tom. And he’s gotta be a one-in-a-million supernova if he snagged this beautiful soul. *
E: CONT'D
N: Sean smiles at Grace. Sean’s eyes get glassy. *
C: SEAN *
D: * Look at me. I’m already crying. * I’ll bring tissues tomorrow. *
E: CONT'D wiping his eyes
N: Everyone laughs and sighs admiringly, except for Tom. He’s * pissed. The third wheel at his own wedding. *
C: SEAN
D: In conclusion, I have just one thing to say to you, Gracie... * Bercinta kakekmu... *
E: CONT'D raising his glass
N: Sean winks. Grace laughs. Everyone raises their glasses and * drinks except for Tom because his is empty. *
C: TOM
D: Bercinta... kakekmu? *
C: GRACE *
D: Oh god. It’s hard to explain. * It means: “I’m going to enter your * grandpa with my body.”
C: TOM
D: So: “Fuck your grandpa”?
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 17.
C: GRACE *
D: In Bali it’s super offensive-- *
C: TOM
D: Everywhere it’s super offensive. Everywhere.
C: GRACE *
D: --but it just made us laugh.
N: Suddenly JEANNIE, Tom’s soft-spoken, harried sister, stands. *
C: JEANNIE
D: Hi, I’m Tom’s sister Jeannie. I’m * not going to try to follow that * speech. I mean, wow. But my son * wants to say something... *
N: She holds the microphone to Tom’s adorable nephew, SCOTTY, 9. *
C: SCOTTY
D: I wanna be a baseball player when I * grow up. Just like Uncle Tom. *
N: His mom squeezes his shoulder, proud. Tom smiles.
C: SCOTTY *
D: Except in the major leagues. *
E: CONT'D
C: JEANNIE
D: Shit. *
S: INT. TOM AND GRACE’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT *
N: Grace stands in front of the bathroom mirror, in pajamas, * putting moisturizer on her face.
C: TOM
D: Ricky said we should have sex before the wedding. I was like, “Yeah right! We’re only half way through the seating chart!”
E: O.S.
N: She stops, looks at the mirror, and makes a decision. Fluffs her hair. Adjusts her t-shirt so it hangs down low. * She steps out a little seductively... *
C: GRACE *
D: Hey baby, whatcha doin? *
N: Tom sits on the bed amid seating name cards, mason jars, and * piles of ribbon, holding a hot glue gun. He looks possessed. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 18.
C: TOM *
D: You do not want to be glued, do you, you little bastard? * * I know tonight didn’t go great, but tomorrow will be perfect. Just need * to finish these centerpieces and * rearrange the seating chart now * that Sean is-- FUCK! *
E: talking to the ribbon to Grace, not looking up
N: Tom pulls his hand away from the glue gun.
C: TOM
D: I burned myself with the glue gun. * It’s fine. Wait, no it’s not. *
E: CONT'D
N: Tom violently tries to shake the ribbon off his hand.
C: GRACE *
D: Hey Tom? Maybe we should have sex.
C: TOM
D: Really? Okay. I just have to finish * these centerpieces.
C: GRACE *
D: Okay, but do you really?
E: O.S.
N: Tom looks up to see... Grace seductively taking off her * pajama bottoms to reveal basic cotton underwear underneath.
C: TOM
D: Oh no. Come on. I love you in a t- shirt and no pants.
C: GRACE *
D: You’re the only man who likes this * look.
C: TOM
D: Are you kidding? The Donald Duck? * It’s so hot. But seriously, I just need to finish these--
C: GRACE *
D: Then I need to reach for this book. *
N: Grace tries reaching for a book on a shelf but is too short. *
C: TOM
D: Ohhh man. Why is it so sexy how you * can’t reach high shelves? *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 19.
C: GRACE *
D: I don’t know, I never understood * this one. *
N: Tom grabs the book easily and pulls Grace into his arms. *
C: TOM
D: Come here. *
N: Tom kisses her and they fall back onto the bed. They share a * tender moment staring into each other’s eyes.
C: TOM
D: Hi. Haven’t done this in a while. *
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: I know. I miss you.
N: They kiss deeply. He sweeps all the name cards off the bed * and his eyes lands on one: SEAN HAWKINS. *
C: TOM *
D: Hey, can I ask you a question? *
C: GRACE *
D: Is it a sexy question? *
C: TOM *
D: Why did you call off your * engagement with Sean? *
C: GRACE *
D: So, not sexy. *
N: Grace sits up and puts her shirt back on. *
C: GRACE *
D: I told you. We were fighting all * the time... He wanted to stay in * Bali, I wanted to move home. We * weren’t on the same page. * * Why are you asking about my ex the * night before our wedding? *
E: CONT'D then, annoyed
C: TOM *
D: Maybe because you invited your ex * to our wedding. *
C: GRACE *
D: I didn’t want to! My dad basically * forced me to invite him. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 20.
C: TOM *
D: Oh, that is much more comforting. *
C: GRACE *
D: I didn’t want to invite anyone, Tom! I wanted to elope-- *
C: TOM
D: Can we not go through this again? *
C: GRACE *
D: The only reason I agreed to do a big, traditional wedding was * because you said we would still * have moments alone, and then you * just disappeared--
C: TOM
D: I was trying to do something romantic! *
C: GRACE *
D: You know what I think is romantic? Actually being together. *
N: There’s a KNOCK on the door. Weird. They open it and see Tom’s mom, Carol, in a nightgown.
C: CAROL
D: Hiii! It’s your future mother-in- * law. Carol. *
C: GRACE *
D: Yup. I know your name, Carol.
C: CAROL
D: Whoopsie, you’re not wearing any * pants, Grace. *
C: TOM
D: This is not a good time, Mom--
C: CAROL *
D: I have to insist you come with me, * Tommy. You can’t spend the night * before your wedding together. It’s bad luck. Your cousin Jenna spent the night with her husband, and now she has Lyme’s disease and can’t wear sandals.
C: TOM
D: Wow, that’s really dark, Mom. But I think at this point--
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 21.
C: GRACE *
D: No, I think she’s right. I’ll * finish the centerpieces. And the * seating chart. But you should go. *
N: Tom looks at Grace, surprised. She’s clearly annoyed with him * and happy to have the space.
C: GRACE *
D: It’s tradition, right?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. TOM’S PARENTS’ BUNGALOW - NIGHT
N: Tom lies on a sleeper-sofa listening to his parents’ SNORING. He peeks over the couch at his parents, who are still spooning in their jammies after all these years. It’s everything he wants, but right now he’s about to marry a woman he’s never felt farther away from.
S: EXT. AMANPULO ISLAND - DAY
N: The next morning, MUSIC PLAYS as we tour Amanpulo from above and finally get why Tom picked it: a gorgeous green firework of an island surrounded by turquoise ocean. The Northern coast is sheer red cliffs topped with green jungle, speckled with guest bungalows... The Southern coast is the main resort complex: a thatched roof lobby connected to a dining cabana. Marge directs her * staff to set up decorations and lights. And Ace sets up * fireworks by the pool. * At the docks, the Security Guard from last night watches all * the bustling staff. He shakes his head and laughs. * Then he sees a FISHING JALOPY pulling up to the docks...
S: EXT. DOCKS - DAY
N: The BOATMAN is a chain-smoking local in sunglasses and a ball cap. He unloads a HUGE CRATE onto the dock and offers a clipboard for the Security Guard to sign.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: What’s in this one? A damn ice sculpture?
E: in Filipino
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 22. The Boatman smiles and offers a pen. The Guard reads the * delivery slip but doesn’t see a 2ND FIGURE climb up out of * the water right behind him. It’s a dripping wet pirate * wearing a skull-print balaclava. *
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Americans are crazy. One time I * went to Disneyworld and saw a bride * and groom getting married by the * rat from Ratatouille! *
E: CONT'D
N: The Boatman gives a slight NOD to the skull-masked pirate. * BAM! The Pirate shoots the Guard in the back of the head. *
C: HOLY FUCKING SHIT. *
D: He pops the lid off the huge crate and the two men pull the * Guard inside. Then latch it and shove it off the dock. *
N: The crate bubbles and disappears under the water. It took * seconds. The workers on the beach have no idea. The killers hop back onto their boat and swing open the door to the cabin. Sunlight pours in and illuminates: Eight pirates around a table. All their faces are masked with different balaclavas: a DOG, a SKULL, a CLOWN, a SHARK, a * RAT, a TIGER, a GHOST and a LIZARD. * The Boatman puts on a BLACK BALACLAVA. He’s the LEADER. * He opens a laptop and pulls up a website. A wedding website: * “Graciela Rivera and Tom Fowler Say I Do ” * Blood-stained gloves click the mouse and land on ISLAND * DETAILS tab. It’s an illustrated map of the island, marked * with all the weekend’s events and times. * We PUSH IN ON THE MAP toward the ink outline of Bungalow 15. *
S: INT. TOM AND GRACE’S BUNGALOW - DAY *
N: The bungalow is now a full bride zone. Renee drinks a mimosa. * Grace sits in front of a vanity, in her dress, as Carol * hairsprays her hair. Like, so much hairspray. * On the vanity, a bridal magazine sits open to a page with a * soft, romantic bridal updo. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 23.
C: CAROL *
D: Ta-da! What do we think? *
N: As the cloud of hairspray clears, we get a full view Grace’s * updo, with a dramatic hair fall. It’s kind of like the * picture, but on steroids. *
C: RENEE *
D: The good news is: If you fall down, * your hair will act as a helmet. *
C: CAROL *
D: * Thank you. *
E: oblivious
N: Jamie enters the hut, hungover. She catches sight of Grace. *
C: JAMIE
D: Whoa, your hair... * * ...is super fun! *
E: off Grace’s glare
C: GRACE *
D: * Can you help me button my dress? *
E: to Jamie, pointed
N: Jamie follows Grace into the bathroom and she buttons the * bodice of her dress. They whisper to each other. *
C: GRACE *
D: Where have you been? You were * supposed to do my hair and now * birds are going to lay eggs in it. *
E: CONT'D
C: JAMIE
D: Sorry, I overslept. I kind of, sort * of had sex with Ricky last night. *
C: GRACE *
D: Ricky?
C: JAMIE
D: Ugh. I know. I was just tipsy and * feeling myself, and he’s dumb in a * refreshing way. It’s embarrassing. * I’ll avoid him today, and then I’ll * never have to see him again. *
C: GRACE *
D: He’s Tom’s best friend. *
C: JAMIE *
D: But how long are you going to stay married? Two years tops, right?
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 24. Grace glares at her. *
C: JAMIE *
D: I’m joking! It’s a joke! * * Okay. She’s ready! *
E: CONT'D then, to everyone
N: Grace walks over to a full-length mirror where we see her * whole look. THE DRESS is a too-tight corset bodice with a * layered tulle skirt. Everyone smiles. Grace looks miserable. *
C: GRACE *
D: Something isn’t right... *
N: ON GRACE, deep in thought, as her family futzes with her. *
C: JAMIE RENEE
D: Your blush needs some Your Spanx are popping out in blending. the back. I’ll fix it. *
E: O.C. O.C.
C: CAROL *
D: I don’t remember what life was like * before the invention of shapewear. *
E: O.C.
S: INT. TOM’S PARENTS’ BUNGALOW - DAY
N: Tom ties his bowtie in the mirror as Larry films it. Ricky * pours a stoic Robert some whiskey. Ricky jumps in front of * Larry, directly addressing the camera. *
C: RICKY *
D: It’s Tom’s big day! Time to get * this party started. Let’s go around * and trade stories about Tommy. *
C: TOM *
D: We don’t need to-- *
C: RICKY *
D: * Last year, on the road, I walked in * on Tom jerking off to a bridal magazine. *
E: to the camera
N: Ricky laughs uproariously. No one else does. *
C: TOM *
D: It was a picture in a wedding magazine and the Wifi was out. So. * Would you care for a bagel, sir? Or * a fruit plate? *
E: then, to Robert
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 25.
C: ROBERT *
D: No, thank you. *
C: RICKY
D: * Dude, why do you use a deeper voice * when you’re talking to Robert? *
E: sotto, to Tom
C: TOM *
D: I do not. *
N: Robert gets up from his chair. *
C: TOM *
D: * Need something, Robert? *
E: CONT'D notably deep voice
C: ROBERT *
D: Just going to the bathroom... *
N: A text pops up on Tom’s phone from Grace: “We need to talk”. * His face drops. This isn’t good. *
C: RICKY *
D: Larry, Tom’s being boring, come * film me doing a backflip. *
S: EXT. POOL / BEACH - DAY *
N: Ace is putting the finishing touches on the reception space. * Elaborate table settings. Mason jar candles. Flowers. * On the beach, guests are gathering at the ceremony site. He * spots Sean regaling guests with a great story. Fuck that guy. * He hurries along and bumps right into Harriett heading down a * path to the beach. She greets Tom with a warm embrace. *
C: HARRIETT *
D: Tom! The man of the moment! You * look very centered, very handsome. *
C: TOM
D: Thank you. I wasn’t sure about the * white jacket. I didn’t want people to think I was trying to look like James Bond.
C: HARRIETT *
D: Don’t worry. You don’t look like * James Bond at all. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 26.
C: TOM
D: Oh... good. *
C: HARRIETT *
D: You heading down to the beach? *
C: TOM *
D: I just have to do one thing. *
C: HARRIETT *
D: Okay! Don’t be late! *
N: Tom heads up wooden steps where signs point to the Zipline * Course and Nature Walk. *
S: EXT. NATURE WALKWAY - DAY
N: Tom walks on the elevated wooden walkway, looking like he’s * walking to his execution. He sees Grace in a hotel robe over * her dress. Even with his nerves, he’s stunned by her beauty. *
C: TOM
D: Wow, you look beautiful... * * So, you wanted to talk? *
E: then, bracing
C: GRACE *
D: I know it’s last minute, I just... * needed to see you once before * walking down the aisle. *
N: Tom laughs. Leans against the railing. Delirious. Nauseous. *
C: TOM
D: I thought you were calling it off.
C: GRACE *
D: Calling off the wedding?? Why? *
C: TOM
D: I don’t know. This weekend hasn’t * exactly gone to plan. We’ve fought * more in the past few months than in * our whole relationship. I thought a * wedding was supposed to be fun. *
C: GRACE *
D: Oh. Okay. Sorry I didn’t make your * wedding more fun for you.
C: TOM
D: Our wedding. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 27.
C: GRACE *
D: Hardly. *

S: EXT. BEACH - DAY *
N: Guests chat amongst themselves, getting refreshments from big * carafes. Carol rushes up to Larry, who is busy filming. *

S: EXT. NATURE WALKWAY - AS BEFORE
C: GRACE *
D: Tom, you got so crazy planning, you * turned into a different person. *
C: TOM
D: Oh! I’m sorry I got a little excited about marrying you! *
C: GRACE *
D: “A little excited”? On the flight over, we paid to upgrade our seats * so you could put together gift bags. *
C: TOM
D: It was a 19 hour flight! That’s * valuable prep time. *
C: GRACE *
D: Tom, you stayed home New Years’ Eve * to call Filipino fireworks vendors. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 28.
C: TOM
D: It was morning in Manila! I just * wanted everything to be perfect for * our wedding. I wish you cared even * a little bit about it. *
C: GRACE *
D: Can we not have this conversation again? *
C: TOM
D: When do you want to have this * conversation? You insisted we pay * for the wedding all on our own. *
C: GRACE *
D: I didn’t want the wedding to be for * anyone but us. *
C: TOM *
D: Well, when I was busy DIY-ing * decorations and making playlists, * all I heard was, “Sounds good, * Tom.” “Whatever you want, Tom.” You * abandoned me. *
C: GRACE *
D: I abandoned you? *
S: INT. RESORT KITCHEN - SAME
N: Two Pirates sweep into the kitchen with shotguns aimed. * COOKS, in the middle of prep, put their hands up, terrified. WAITERS arranging trays drop their food. The Pirates hold fingers to their masks. SHHHHH...
S: EXT. NATURE WALKWAY - AS BEFORE *
C: GRACE *
D: I told you from the beginning I wanted it to just be you and me in * the middle of the ocean-- *
C: TOM
D: And for the four hundredth time, * that would’ve killed my parents.
C: GRACE *
D: Right. And that’s why I’m here. But * you haven’t listened to one thing * I’ve wanted since you proposed. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 29.
C: TOM *
D: That’s not true. *
C: GRACE *
D: You’re right. You stopped caring * before the proposal. Otherwise you * wouldn’t have done it in front of * an entire baseball stadium! *
C: TOM *
D: It was romantic! *
C: GRACE *
D: It wasn’t me. It’s not what I * wanted. *
C: TOM *
D: Well, what did you want? *
C: GRACE *
D: I didn’t want to get married at * all! *
N: Tom takes a step back, like the words hit him in the chest. *

C: SEAN *
D: Renee, is everything okay? *
C: RENEE *
D: The bride and groom are missing. *
S: EXT. NATURE WALKWAY - SAME *
C: GRACE *
D: This shouldn’t be news, Tom. I told * you on our first date I didn’t * believe in marriage. *
C: TOM *
D: Why did you say yes then? *
C: GRACE *
D: You’ve been so down about baseball * and your future... I wanted you to * be happy. *
C: TOM *
D: If you don’t want to go through * with this, it’s not too late. *
C: GRACE *
D: WHAT? We dragged everyone we know * to the Philippines for our wedding. *
C: TOM *
D: Just tell me, Grace. Do you want to * marry me today? *
C: GRACE *
D: * This is crazy! I... *
E: sputtering
N: Tom nods. This is his answer. *
C: TOM *
D: Well, that’s settled then. *
N: Grace looks at him with a gutting realization. *
C: GRACE *
D: Oh my god. You convinced yourself I * was calling off the wedding. And * now you’re making me do it. *
C: TOM
D: Yeah. I want you to put me out of my fucking misery.
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 31. Grace SLAPS HIM HARD. *
C: TOM
D: Gah. Your ring cut me--
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: Won’t happen again.
N: Grace tugs her engagement ring off, throws it at him. Tom’s * baseball reflexes kick in, and he catches it with one hand. They are both briefly impressed by that catch, then Grace * heads off down the path, furious. Tom calls out:
C: TOM
D: Great! Go tell your parents it’s * over! I’m sure they’ll be thrilled! *
N: He punches the railing. Fuck. *
S: EXT. JUNGLE - SAME *
N: The Pirate Leader silently directs his men to go down * different trails. Surrounding the beach. Getting in position. *
S: EXT. NATURE WALKWAY - DAY
N: Tom leans on a railing, in disbelief about how everything went so wrong, when Marge pulls up in her golf cart.
C: MARGE
D: There you are! We were about to * send out a search party. *
N: She pins a boutonniere of tropical flowers to his lapel.
C: TOM
D: I don’t need that.
C: MARGE
D: You do. The waiters are wearing * white jackets. People will be confused.
C: TOM
D: I don’t need it because it’s not happening.
N: Tom shows her the engagement ring in his hand. Glinting in the sun. Marge is shocked. She watches Tom walk off alone. Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 32.
S: EXT. BEACH - DAY
N: The guests are getting sweaty and losing patience. *
C: CAROL
D: I have a bad feeling about this.
C: LARRY
D: It’s gonna be fine, honey--
N: Suddenly she SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER.
C: LARRY
D: I think you might be overreacting.
E: CONT'D
N: She’s looking over her husband’s shoulder at Pirates spilling * out of the jungle. Guns aimed. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: Hands up! No one gets hurt! *
N: The guests scream as they’re corralled like cattle. One * guest, a middle-aged MAN, tries to make a run for it. * BANG! A pirate SHOOTS the man, grazing his arm. He YELPS. *
S: EXT. NATURE WALKWAY - DAY *
N: Tom startles at the ECHOING GUNSHOT coming from the beach. He * looks toward the beach but his view is obstructed by trees. * He cautiously climbs three rungs of a ladder to the ZIPLINE * PLATFORM. He gets dizzy, terrified by how high he is. * But then he sees it: all of the guests surrounded by pirates * with guns. Suddenly every petty resentment in Tom’s brain * vanishes... replaced with one primal mission:
C: TOM *
D: Grace... *
S: EXT. TOM AND GRACE’S BUNGALOW - DAY *
N: Grace, completely oblivious, stomps up the steps to the door: *
C: GRACE *
D: Sorry I’m late! But it doesn’t * matter because the wedding... *
N: She enters and sees no one’s here. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 33.
C: GRACE *
D: ...is off. *
E: CONT'D
N: She grabs an open champagne bottle and SLAMS THE DOOR. *
S: EXT. POOL - DAY *
N: The wedding guests are marched into the swimming pool in their fancy clothes by masked pirates at gunpoint. * The resort workers are marched elsewhere, held separately. * Everyone is shaking with fear and shock. Larry helps Carol * down the steps into the pool. * Jamie instinctively holds her phone above the water as she steps into the pool. A pirate with a snarling pitbull on his * balaclava (DOG-FACE) aims his gun at her. *
C: DOG-FACE *
D: Ay! Hands down! *
C: JAMIE *
D: But my phone will get ruined... *
C: HARRIETT *
D: Sweetie, I think that’s the point. *
C: JAMIE *
D: I haven’t backed it up in a while! * I’ll lose a lot of texts! *
N: Other Pirates aim their guns at Jamie, screaming at her. *
C: DOG-FACE *
D: Now!! *
N: Even the hostages starts screaming at Jamie. *
C: RENEE/ ROBERT/ JEANNIE *
D: Drop the phone!! / Let it go! / Why * isn’t your phone on auto-backup?! *
N: Jamie drops her hand, and her phone, into the water. She * sighs dramatically as she watches her iPhone drown. * The Pirate Leader walks to the edge of the pool. He’s * terrifying in his black balaclava, but also charismatic. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: Hello hello. No need to be scared. * As long as everybody follows * directions, this will be painless. *
E: MORE
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 34.
C: PIRATE LEADER
D: * Except for that guy we shot. But * he’ll be fine. Probably. *
E: CONT'D then, realizing
N: ANGLE ON the man who they shot, with a scarf wrapped around * his bleeding arm. *
C: PIRATE LEADER
D: Raise your hand when you hear your * name.
E: CONT'D
N: A pirate with a rat on his balaclava (RAT-FACE) holds the * stack of seating chart name cards. He reads off the names: *
C: RAT-FACE
D: Robert Rivera... *
N: Robert hesitates. Knowing his wealth makes him a target. Harriett looks at him but he gives her a look to be quiet. *
C: PIRATE LEADER
D: Where are you, Robert?
C: CAROL
D: Robert! They’re calling you.
C: ROBERT
D: Thank you, Carol. *
E: gritted teeth
N: Robert raises his hand and Rat-Face staples the name card to * his suit.
C: RAT-FACE *
D: Larry Fowler. *
C: LARRY *
D: Present. *
N: Rat-Face walks over to Larry and staples his name card. *
C: CAROL *
D: And I’m his wife Carol Fowler, so * you don’t have to make two trips. *
C: RAT-FACE *
D: Thank you. *
C: CAROL *
D: Of course. *
C: RAT-FACE *
D: Sean Hawkins. *
N: Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 35. Sean wades to the steps of the pool facing the Pirate Leader. *
C: SEAN *
D: Right here. And I’ll say now if you * hurt anyone in this pool, you’ll * answer to me. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: Ohh, is this the hero of the group? *
N: Everyone nods in general agreement. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: There’s always one. * * Watch him. *
E: CONT'D to another pirate
N: A Pirate trains his gun on Sean and he wades back slowly. *
C: RAT-FACE *
D: Ricky Silver. *
C: RICKY *
D: Wut-Wut. *
N: Ricky gets stapled and then wades over to Jamie, trying to * play it cool. *
C: RICKY
D: Heyyy. I texted you this morning. * Didn’t get a text back.
E: CONT'D
C: JAMIE
D: Are you fucking serious?
N: IN A RAPID FIRE MONTAGE: We see name cards stapled to everyone’s clothes, until they have the “Bride” and “Groom” name cards left over. The Pirate Leader in the pitch black mask glares at his men.
C: PIRATE LEADER
D: Where is Bride and Groom?
C: RAT-FACE *
D: * I thought she was bride. *
E: pointing
N: ANGLE ON a YOUNG WOMAN in the pool in a white dress. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 36.
C: RENEE *
D: No, Jennifer just thought it would * be appropriate to wear a white * dress to a wedding. *
C: JENNIFER *
D: I didn’t know that was an actual * rule! *
C: CAROL *
D: Everyone knows that. *
C: PIRATE LEADER
D: This is problem. They could be * trying to get help. And if help * comes, we have to kill everyone. We * don’t want to kill everyone. *
C: RICKY *
D: Quick question: How many of us do * you want to kill? *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: * We need to find them and then we * proceed. So... where is Bride and * Groom? *
E: ignoring him
N: No one says anything. Harriett looks around, visibly nervous. *
C: HARRIETT *
D: I saw Tom walking up to the Nature * Walk. He seemed nervous. Like he * was having cold feet. *
C: CAROL
D: Tom’s having cold feet?
E: surprised and upset
C: ROBERT
D: Is that really what we’re worried about right now??
C: CAROL
D: I’m a mom. I can worry about a lot of things at the same time. I’m * also worried about Larry’s mole. *
C: LARRY *
D: It’s fine, sweetie. *
C: CAROL *
D: It’s not fine, it’s bigger. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 37.
C: PIRATE LEADER
D: Spread out. Look for them. *
N: Four pirates stay surrounding the pool. The rest go hunting.
S: EXT. TOM AND GRACE’S BUNGALOW - DAY *
N: Tom sprints towards their bungalow but he hears a SCREAM inside. Oh shit. He’s too late! INSIDE THE BUNGALOW Grace is SCREAMING in frustration. She can’t get her wedding * dress off, because it buttons up the back. She’s trapped! OUTSIDE Tom’s heart is beating out of his chest. He doesn’t know what he’s going to find inside. But he’s got to try.
C: TOM
D: Shit! Grace! I’m coming in! *
N: He tries to open the door but it’s LATCHED FROM THE INSIDE--
C: GRACE *
D: FUCK OFF, TOM!
E: O.S.
N: Tom’s never been so relieved to hear those words.
C: TOM
D: Oh thank god. Grace. Please open * the door. I know you’re mad at me--
N: INSIDE Grace paces, teary-eyed, with a bottle of champagne in hand. *
C: GRACE *
D: No! I feel great! Honestly, I’ve never been better. I’m on a * tropical island. I’m well on my way * to day drunk. And I don’t have to * answer to anyone. *
N: OUTSIDE Tom sees a pirate, Dog-Face, coming up the dirt road. He’s * about to see Tom because Tom’s locked outside.
C: TOM
D: No no no. This isn’t happening.
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 38.
C: GRACE *
D: Oh, it’s happening, buddy. *
E: O.S.
C: TOM
D: Grace, shhhh-- *
N: Tom scrambles around the wrap-around porch to hide. He bangs on the window shutters (island-style, no glass) and then punches straight through, hurting his hand.
C: GRACE *
D: “Shhh”? Are you seriously shushing * me right now? *
E: O.S.
N: Tom climbs through the window cradling his bleeding hand... ...and sees Grace lying on the couch, drinking champagne out * of the bottle. Her eyes widen when she sees Tom. *
C: GRACE *
D: Tom!! Is that blood--
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: Don’t have a blood freakout right now.
C: GRACE *
D: Don’t tell me what to do--
N: Tom covers Grace’s mouth with his bleeding hand. She squirms. *
C: TOM
D: * There are pirates. They have everyone.
E: whispered
C: GRACE *
D: WHAT?
E: muffled
N: Tom pulls her to the door and cracks the shutters to see: Dog-Face, kicking through a door three bungalows down. * Machine gun in-hand. Bullet straps around his chest. Grenade * on his belt. Coming this way. Bungalow by bungalow. He’d see them if they ran out the door. They’re trapped.
C: GRACE *
D: Oh my god. We have to do something. * We have to call for help. *
E: CONT'D
N: Grace runs over to the landline and checks it: no dial tone. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 39.
C: GRACE *
D: The phone’s out. *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM *
D: The Wifi is out too. Marge said the * north side gets some cell service * from the next island but-- *
C: GRACE *
D: WHY DID YOU PICK AN ISLAND WITH BAD * CELL RECEPTION? *
C: TOM *
D: BECAUSE I WANTED PEOPLE TO BE * PRESENT IN THE MOMENT. *
N: BANG! Another door gets kicked down. Grace’s breathing gets * shallow. She starts to panic. *
C: GRACE *
D: Oh God. I can’t breathe. *
C: TOM
D: I know, it’s--
C: GRACE *
D: I mean, I really can’t breathe. I’m wearing shapewear. Get me out of this dress. Now. Now.
C: TOM
D: We don’t have time!
C: GRACE *
D: DO IT!
N: Tom looks at the back of the dress, sees twenty tiny pearl buttons. He starts trying to undo buttons as fast as he can.
C: TOM
D: How are there so many buttons? *
C: GRACE *
D: I don’t know! I hate this dress.
C: TOM
D: Yeah, it’s not great.
C: GRACE *
D: WHAT? Fuck you, it’s my wedding * dress!
C: TOM
D: You just said you hated it!
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 40.
C: GRACE *
D: I do! But you’re supposed to see me and start crying because I’m so hot * and you’re the luckiest man in the * world. * * God, I’m gonna die in this dress. *
E: then, in panic tears
C: TOM
D: No you’re not!
N: Tom’s frantic eyes land on the hook-latch on the door.
C: TOM
D: If the door’s latched from the inside, he’ll know we’re in here.
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: He’ll also know we’re in here when he comes in and we’re in here!
C: TOM
D: Ooooo! Wait!
N: Tom runs into the bathroom and cranks the SHOWER on.
C: TOM
D: He’ll think we’re in the shower!
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: And what, come back at a better time?? Leave a note?
T: SMASH CUT TO:
N: BANG! Dog-Face kicks through the door! But it’s not their door. It’s the bungalow next door. He scans the room with his machine gun. No one here. *
S: INT. TOM AND GRACE’S BUNGALOW *
N: As Tom rips down the mosquito net hanging over the bed--
C: TOM
D: Here’s the plan: He thinks we’re in the shower, moves to open the bathroom door... I jump out and get him in the net.
C: GRACE *
D: Oh my god, that’s an amazing plan.
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 41.
C: TOM
D: Yeah?
C: GRACE *
D: Fuck no! You’re going to throw a net over a pirate?
C: TOM
D: Have you ever tried to get out of a net? It’s hard to get out of a net! *
C: GRACE *
D: What about this?
N: Grace grabs a can of aerosol hairspray from the vanity. *
C: GRACE *
D: I’ll spray him in the eyes!
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: How is hairspray in the eyes better than a net over his head? *
N: OUTSIDE Dog-Face (and his sunglasses!) peeks underneath bungalows for * hiding spots. Tom and Grace are seconds from being found. * INSIDE Tom snatches a hotel matchbook from the night stand and they WHISPER-ARGUE RAPID-FIRE:
C: TOM
D: Light a match, then spray the hairspray... Flamethrower!
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: It won’t work. It’s too many steps.
C: TOM
D: It’s two steps! It’ll surprise him, then I get him in the net.
C: GRACE *
D: No, Tom, because BULLETS SHOOT THROUGH NETS!
C: TOM
D: How can he shoot straight? He’s in a net!
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 42.
C: GRACE *
D: I swear to god, if you say “net” one more time--
N: They’re interrupted by BOOTS ON THE PORCH. It’s happening! They flatten themselves on either side of the * shuttered door. Suddenly the latch SHAKES as the door is jangled. They’ve never been more scared in their lives. And they haven’t agreed on a plan. They’re each on their own. Tom grips his mosquito net. Grace grips her hairspray. * The door KICKS IN right between them! Sunlight catches the dust and splinters as they settle... Dog-Face sees the empty room and the closed bathroom door with the SHOWER RUNNING. He steps in and-- Tom whips the mosquito net over his head! He gets him!! But Tom freezes up, unsure what to do next. * Grace jumps in and SPRAYS HER HAIRSPRAY-- * Dog-Face is protected by his sunglasses but Tom’s nailed! He SCREAMS, blinded! Dog-Face kicks Grace in the stomach and reels back, slamming * Tom against coat hooks on the wall. Then he rifle-whips Tom’s head, right through the net. Tom spins and hits the floor hard with a sickening THUD. Dog-Face shirks off the net and it lands on Tom’s face. He * aims his gun at Grace. She instantly puts her hands up. *
C: GRACE *
D: Sorry sorry sorry never mind sorry. *
E: CONT'D
N: Tom puts his hands up too, flat on his back. Under his own * net. Head bloody. Eyelids glued shut and stinging like hell. *
C: TOM
D: * What... the... fuck... was... that.
E: low, to Grace
C: GRACE *
D: How’d that net work out for you? *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 43. Dog-Face isn’t even out of breath. He grabs Tom’s wrists and binds them with plastic zipties. He does the same to Grace. * Then he uses another ziptie to bind Tom and Grace together. * Dog-Face calmly removes his sunglasses and wipes the hairspray off. Then lifts his walkie-talkie:
C: DOG-FACE *
D: I have them. Alive.
S: EXT. SWIMMING POOL - SAME
N: The Pirate Leader listens on the other end. *
C: DOG-FACE *
D: Bungalow Fifteen. Pick me up. *
E: OVER WALKIE
N: He turns to a pirate with a skull-print mask (BONE-FACE). *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: Go collect them and we can begin. *
N: The guests all look at each other, worried. *
S: INT. TOM AND GRACE’S BUNGALOW *
N: Dog-Face swigs the open champagne while rifling through their * luggage and dressers. Pocketing random things. *
C: GRACE *
D: What do you want? Money? Check my * purse, I have some cash-- ooh and a * bag of pot gummies. They are very * potent though, only take a half. *
C: TOM *
D: * You’re not supposed to take those * on the plane! *
E: whispered, to Grace
C: GRACE *
D: * Uh-oh, am I gonna get arrested? *
E: sarcastic
C: DOG-FACE
D: Your father is rich. We take his * money. *
C: GRACE *
D: Right. Okay. You are still welcome * to the gummies. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 44. A HORN HONKS outside. Dog-Face peeks out the blinds. *
C: DOG-FACE
D: Get up.
N: Tom and Grace struggle to get to their feet with their wrists * bound. Tom because he’s half-blind and bleeding from the head. Grace because of her binding wedding dress. *
C: TOM *
D: 1, 2, 3, stand.
N: They both fall down.
C: TOM *
D: 1, 2, 3, stand.
E: CONT'D
N: They try again, fall again.
C: GRACE *
D: You’re getting blood on the dress!
C: TOM
D: I hope I don’t ruin it. *
E: wooden
N: Dog-Face pulls Grace up to her feet. *
C: GRACE *
D: Thank you. Chivalry is not dead. *
S: EXT. CLIFF-VIEW CABANAS - DAY *
N: Grace and Tom are marched out to the dirt road where Bone- * Face came in Marge’s resort golf cart to pick them up. * Dog-Face shoves Tom and Grace into the backseat. He loops * another ziptie through a steel bar on the back of the cart. *
C: GRACE *
D: Can you buckle me? *
N: Dog-Face sighs and buckles her seatbelt. *
C: GRACE *
D: You want him to buckle you? *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM *
D: I’m good. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 45.
C: GRACE *
D: * Ooh, someone’s a real bad boy now * that he’s single. *
E: mocking
N: Dog-Face shoves Bone-Face to the passenger seat and drives. *
S: EXT. POOL - DAY *
N: The hostages huddle together in the pool. The Pirates pace * the patio with guns drawn. * ANGLE ON Jamie biting her nails. Sean wades up to her. *
C: SEAN
D: Jamie, are you doing alright?
C: JAMIE
D: Yeah, I’m just freaking out a little.
N: Sean puts his hand on Jamie’s cheek and stares deeply into her eyes.
C: SEAN
D: Hey. It’s normal to feel scared. But I won’t let anything happen to you or your family. I promise.
N: Jamie smiles, hypnotized by his charm. Jeannie puts her hand * on Sean’s bicep. *
C: JEANNIE
D: Hi, Sean. Yeah. I am also feeling * scared.
N: ANGLE ON Harriett behind Robert, rubbing his shoulders. *
C: HARRIETT *
D: Now I want you to do the breathing * exercise we learned at Esalen. I’m * about to hit a pressure point. *
N: Robert closes his eyes as she massages him. Breathing weirdly * through his nose.
C: RENEE
D: If he keeps making that noise, can you just go ahead and shoot me?
E: calls out to the pirates
N: Carol laughs, and Renee looks at her, surprised. A first moment of connection. Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 46. The Pirate Leader checks the time, losing patience. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: The happy couple will be hear any * minute, so let’s get to business. * Where is the father of the bride? *
N: Silence. *
C: CAROL *
D: Robert, that’s you again. *
C: ROBERT *
D: Yes. What do you want? *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: We call my colleague on this * satellite phone and you transfer * $10 million dollars to an account. *
C: ROBERT *
D: I don’t have that kind of money. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: We Googled your net worth and-- * what was it again? *
C: RAT-FACE *
D: $23 million. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: We do research. It’s our job. *
C: ROBERT *
D: I’m not doing anything until I know * my daughter is safe. *
C: CAROL *
D: And his son-in-law. *
N: Robert shrugs. *
C: RICKY *
D: I knew your dad was rich but didn’t * know he was freakin’ loaded. Nice. *
N: Ricky holds out a high five which Jamie leaves hanging. *
C: JAMIE
D: I can’t believe I had sex with you.
C: RICKY
D: Honestly, I was surprised. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 47.
C: JEANNIE *
D: You two had sex? *
C: RICKY *
D: * Right here. One and half times. *
E: proudly
N: General “EWWS” and GROANS from the hostages. Except Carol, * who whispers to Larry. *
C: CAROL *
D: Remember our pool sex days, honey? *
N: Larry smiles, remembering fondly. *
S: EXT. JUNGLE ROAD - DAY
N: Meanwhile, the golf cart drives across the island. Grace and * Tom sit ziptied to the back. Grace rambles, nervously. *
C: GRACE *
D: We actually called off the wedding. I was trying to figure out what we were gonna tell everyone... but now... You guys saved us a very awkward announcement. Ha.
C: TOM
D: You’re doing your nervous talking thing.
C: GRACE *
D: No, I’m being charming. *
C: TOM
D: Mm-hmm. *
C: GRACE *
D: We were so in sync most of the * time. We both didn’t want kids, we * love our jobs, we love traveling. * Oh, we have these adorable pitbulls * Frankie and Edgar. You must love * pitbulls! You know, because of the * mask. And Bone-Face Guy, are you * interested in biology? *
C: TOM *
D: I don’t think their masks imply * their interests. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 48.
C: GRACE *
D: * What was I talking about? Oh, why * we broke up. Yeah, the sex was * never a problem. I mean, look at * him. My friends were always like, * “He’s so hot.” And I was like, “I * know!” And they were like-- *
E: ignoring him
C: TOM
D: They can see how handsome I am, you * don’t need to talk about it-- *
C: GRACE *
D: I guess we weren’t on the same page * about marriage. Between my parents’ * divorce and my first engagement, it * never seemed right for me. Maybe it * was a self-fulfilling prophecy. Do you know what that phrase means “self-fulfilling prophecy”?
C: TOM
D: Are you teaching them English?
C: GRACE *
D: I think I was scared of getting * hurt. But then I met Tom, and it * was just... easy. Almost too easy, * y’know? I didn’t trust it. I kept * waiting for it to get messed up, * but for some reason it didn’t... *
N: This lands on Tom, despite - you know - the pirates.
C: GRACE *
D: ...Until today. Obviously. Woof, * did Tom mess it up. What about you? * Are you dating anyone? Have you * always wanted to be a pirate--
E: CONT'D
N: Bone-Face turns around and holds a gun up to Grace’s face. *
C: BONE-FACE *
D: NO MORE TALK.
N: Grace freezes in fear. He turns back around. She stares at * Dog-Face for a moment, thinking. Then: *
C: GRACE *
D: Excuse me, sirs? *
C: TOM
D: Grace, they’re going to hurt you. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 49.
C: GRACE *
D: I couldn’t help but notice you smell like cigarettes. And I am * loving it. Is there any way I could * bum one? It would help with the * deep sense of dread I’m * experiencing right now.
C: TOM
D: Since when do you smoke??? *
C: GRACE *
D: I smoked all through my 20s. I was * too embarrassed to tell you. * * You don’t even have to undo my * hands, I can smoke with no hands.
E: back to pirates
C: DOG-FACE *
D: A cigarette would shut her up.
C: GRACE *
D: Dog-Face Guy has a point. *
N: Bone-Face gets a pack of cigarettes from his vest and pulls * one out and sticks it in her mouth. *
C: GRACE *
D: Ahhhh! Thank you! You. Are. The.
E: CONT'D
N: He lights the cigarette with his zippo and she puffs on it. *
C: GRACE *
D: ...best.
E: CONT'D
N: Grace shoves her lit cigarette onto Dog-Face’s ski mask. When * the ember touches his mask, it IGNITES the hairspray that she * sprayed all over him. His whole mask goes up in flames. Dog- * Face SCREAMS. Grace SCREAMS. Tom SCREAMS. * Dog-Face JUMPS out of the moving cart to extinguish himself. * Bone-Face jumps out to help, but falls, and the back wheel of * the cart RUNS OVER his foot. He YELPS. * The cart continues at high speed down a hill. Tom and Grace * are zip-tied to the back so they go along for the ride...
S: EXT. JUNGLE - SAME
N: The golf cart wheel catches on a rock and FLIPS. It ROLLS * LIKE A DIE down the sloped jungle and finally settles... Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 50. Upside down on its roof... Grace, still seat-belted, hangs upside-down above Tom. Both * banged up and bleary-eyed. From Tom’s POV, Grace’s up-do * comes loose above him and her hair falls toward his face. *
C: GRACE *
D: See, that plan worked because it * only had one step. *
C: TOM *
D: I’m still very mad at you. But that * was fucking amazing. *
C: GRACE *
D: I am furious with you. But thank * you. *
C: TOM *
D: Now let’s get out of this golf cart * and end this hell. *
N: Tom pulls at the bent steel bar they’re zip-tied to. Trying to dislodge it. He kicks it with his heel. Again and again. BACK AT THE JUNGLE ROAD Dog-Face is unconscious in the foliage. The stretchy fabric of his mask has fused with his charred, bubbly face. Bone-Face isn’t doing great either. A broken foot and road * rash on his arm. He reaches for his walkie-talkie... but it’s smashed. He staggers forward, disoriented, trying to figure * out which direction the cart went. * BACK AT THE GOLF CART Tom and Grace shake to snap the bar to free them. No luck. *
C: TOM *
D: We need to get this thing right * side up. Hold on tight. *
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: * I don’t need to, I’m buckled. *
E: smugly
N: Tom pushes against the trunk of a palm tree with his legs * with all his might. * WHAM. He flips the cart over. He LAUGHS triumphantly. * They try to push the bar through the roof of the cart. Tom * gets it a little loose, but then: * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 51. The cart starts sliding BACKWARDS down a hill. Tom drags his * foot but the hill gets steeper and they pick up momentum. *
C: GRACE *
D: Oh shit!! *
E: CONT'D
N: IN THE JUNGLE * Bone-Face hears Grace’s scream. He heads through the thick * jungle foliage toward the sound. * ON THE HILL * Grace looks backward to see where they’re headed. *
C: GRACE *
D: You need to steer!! *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM *
D: How? *
C: GRACE *
D: With your freakishly long legs! *
C: TOM *
D: They’re not-- fine. *
N: Tom hoists his long legs over the front seat and reaches the * steering wheel. *
C: GRACE *
D: Left! *
N: He steers the cart to the left JUST missing a palm tree. * Grace looks backward and directs him. *
C: GRACE *
D: Right! *
E: CONT'D
N: Tom turns right and they avoid a giant ROCK. Grace’s eyes go * wide when she sees: *
C: GRACE *
D: Cliff! *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM *
D: What? *
C: GRACE *
D: CLIFF!! *
N: Tom turns to see the cart is headed toward a sheer cliff with * a 100 foot drop to a rocky shore. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 52.
C: TOM *
D: The gear shift! Get it into park! *
N: Grace tries to push the gear shift into park with her foot. * She kicks with all her might and the gear shift BREAKS OFF. * She SCREAMS in frustration. * Tom turns the cart sharply to the left which HALTS it feet * away from the cliff’s edge. They SIGH in relief. But then... * The cart now starts sliding backwards AGAIN down ANOTHER hill * toward ANOTHER edge of the same cliff. *
C: GRACE *
D: Come on. *
N: Grace drags her steel-toed heels into the ground, trying to * stop them. And Tom pulls like hell on the bar, trying to dislodge it-- * their only way out. * Tom kicks at a weak part of the bar with his heel and snaps * it. Then slides their ziptied wrists off the broken bar... Right as the golf cart rolls over the edge! For a split * second, they’re safe... but Grace gets dragged by the cart! * Her dress is caught! The dress rips free just as the golf * cart plummets down... ...but Grace hangs in mid-air! * ...because her ziptied wrists are still attached to Tom’s and he’s splayed on top of the cliff trying to hold her up. Grace looks down to see the golf-cart CRASH onto ocean rocks! * Grace’s weight is pulling Tom slowly over the edge. He can’t * grab onto anything with his wrists pulled in front of him. * He catches his foot on a tree root. He looks DOWN at Darcy * and the 100-foot drop and his VERTIGO kicks in. He shuts his * eyes tight. * One of Grace’s zip-ties gets CUT by the rocky edge, freeing * her left arm and flinging her gravity even further downward. * Tom opens his eyes and looks at Grace, dangling, hopeless. He * can’t save them. He can’t fix this. They’re gonna die.
C: TOM
D: I can’t...
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 53.
C: GRACE *
D: Tom...
N: Finally he stops being pulled over. But it’s not because of him... It’s because of Grace. * She dug her steel-toed shoe into the side of the cliff, using * it as a foothold. * They both freeze, scared to shift their weight a millimeter.
C: TOM
D: Don’t move!
C: GRACE *
D: You don’t move!
N: IN THE JUNGLE * Bone-Face reaches the site where the cart crashed and follows * the tracks leading down the hill, gun drawn. * ON THE CLIFFS * Grace carefully climbs up the cliff-face, dropping her other * heel down to the rocky shore below. Using her free hand, she * climbs onto Tom, using him as a ladder. * She pulls herself over the edge just in time to see Bone-Face * racing down the hill towards them, machine gun out. *
C: GRACE *
D: Damn it! Bone-Face Guy!! *
E: CONT'D
N: BANG-BANG-BANG! Grace scrambles up onto Tom as BULLETS bite * the dirt around them. They hide behind a rock. *
C: TOM
D: STOP CALLING HIM “BONE FACE GUY”!
N: BANG-BANG-BANG! --Then silence! Tom steals a peek and sees: *
C: TOM
D: He’s out of ammo! What do we do?
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: Why are you asking me? Do something baseball-y!!
C: TOM
D: This is nothing like baseball! You never understood baseball! Just run at him!
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 54. Tom yanks Grace to her feet and charges towards him but Grace * runs the other way so they go nowhere and HIT THE GROUND.
C: TOM
D: I said run at him!
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: I thought you misspoke! *
N: Bone-Face reloads bullets one-by-one into his magazine. He sees Tom and Grace sprinting at him! It’s a race! * He locks the reloaded magazine and raises to shoot but-- Tom does a killer baseball slide right into his ankles! Grace’s dragged to the ground, skinning her elbows-- * Bone-Face scrambles up from his fall. He tries to swing his * gun around but Tom head-butts him. Bone-Face’s gun FLIES * across the ground and off the cliff. * Grace sees Bone-Face unclip a grenade from his belt-- *
C: GRACE *
D: No no no no!
E: CONT'D
N: Grace uses all her strength to pull her (and Tom’s) hands * towards it and grab the grenade-- --But Tom’s hands aren’t guarding his face anymore so he gets PUNCHED RIGHT IN THE NOSE. Grace and Bone-Face play tug-of-war with the grenade as Bone- * Face chokes Tom with his other hand.
C: GRACE *
D: Give me the grenade! Sir! Sir!
E: CONT'D
N: Tom can’t breathe, his arms are tied, so he KICKS Bone-Face * as hard as he can. * Bone-Face flies backward, his head landing on a SHARP ROCK. * CRACK. Blood pools out behind his head. And then: silence. *
S: EXT. RESORT POOL - DAY *
N: The Pirate Leader looks through binoculars. Nothing. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: They should be here by now. Head up * the road. Check on them. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 55. Two pirates (SHARK-FACE and GHOST-FACE) nod and head down a * trail, walking past a sign with arrows pointing to the * destinations: “Bungalows, Nature Walk, Zip Line Course”... *
S: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
N: Tom and Grace, bloody and full of adrenaline, scramble to * stand. Bone-Face lies still, his bloody head hidden from view * behind a rock. *
C: TOM GRACE
D: Is he dead? Oh my god, oh my god-- *
C: GRACE *
D: Are you dead?
E: CONT'D calling to the pirate
N: Tom tilts his head to see a VERY bloody mess where the * pirate’s head used to be. *
C: TOM
D: Oh, uh-huh, yep, he’s very dead. *
C: GRACE *
D: Yes! You killed him! *
C: TOM *
D: I killed him! *
N: THEN, it sinks in:
C: TOM
D: Oh my god, I killed him. Grace. I * killed a man.
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: How do you feel?
C: TOM
D: Horrible. And also happy? Excited * even? But I kind of want to shit * myself.
N: Grace suddenly shoots her head up at the sky. *
C: TOM
D: Are you... okay?
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: Oh yeah, I’m fine! I just looked over and I saw all the blood, and * was that brain? *
E: MORE
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 56.
C: GRACE
D: Did I see some brain? So I’m just * going look up at the sky so I don’t * pass out. *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: Great idea, very good. *
N: Tom looks out to the coastline, trying to think of a plan. He * distantly sees the dock with the Riva Aquarama. A pirate * (LIZARD-FACE) sits on the dock. Guarding it. *
C: TOM *
D: We need to find a way off this * island... *
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: It might help that I got a grenade * for us! He was trying to blow us up but I got it. Point for Grace! *
N: Grace proudly lifts the grenade in the air. Tom’s eyes widen. *
C: TOM
D: Okay, Grace...? *
C: GRACE *
D: Yeah? What’s up?
N: Grace’s still looking up so Tom chooses his words carefully. *
C: TOM
D: Remember that time when I was driving on the highway. And you very calmly said to pull over. And after I pulled over, you told me * there was a big spider by my head.
C: GRACE *
D: Yeah...
C: TOM
D: It was smart because if you had told me when I was driving, I could have panicked and crashed the car. So, don’t panic but--
C: GRACE *
D: Tom. We’re standing next to a dead * pirate who shot at us with a * machine gun. Do you think I’m worried about a spider right now?
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 57.
C: TOM
D: There’s no spider, I just don’t want you to panic... Your grenade * doesn’t have a pin.
C: GRACE *
D: WHAT?! WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? It’s gonna explode?
C: TOM
D: No no no, just hold it exactly like * you are. Don’t change a thing. The * pin holds the handle on. So when the pin’s not there... as soon as you let go of the grenade... the handle pops off. And that starts the fuse. And THEN it blows up.
C: GRACE *
D: How do you know so much about grenades?
C: TOM
D: Movies.
C: GRACE *
D: Oh god. Should I throw it? What should I do??
C: TOM
D: Well, my concern is you won’t be able to throw it far enough... to not blow us up. No offense.
C: GRACE *
D: None taken. I share your concern. Can you throw it? Can I hand it to you?
C: TOM
D: Generally with live grenades you don’t wanna do a lot of passing around...
C: GRACE *
D: Okay... Okay... So we drop it off * the cliff. *
C: TOM
D: The explosion could take the cliff * out and... we’d be standing on it.
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 58.
C: GRACE *
D: So what, I just hold this live * grenade? This grenade is just part of my life now?
C: TOM
D: Only until we find a way to cut our wrists free.
N: Tom dips his head towards the dead masked pirate.
C: GRACE *
D: Did you just kiss his forehead?
C: TOM
D: Yeah, for good luck. No, I’m trying * to search him. For a knife.
N: Tom tries to open the guy’s vest pockets with his teeth. Grace looks over... and regrets it. *
C: GRACE *
D: Okay, that’s a lot of blood. That’s an insane amount of blood.
N: Grace breathes deeply. She is NOT good with blood. *
C: TOM
D: Grace. DO NOT PASS OUT. If you pass * out you’ll blow us up. And then there’ll be even more blood.
C: GRACE *
D: Why would you say that?
C: TOM
D: I don’t know. That was a mistake. But you have to trust me.
C: GRACE *
D: Okay. I don’t totally trust you right now, because the whole net thing. And how you drove us off a * cliff. And how you always close the * door when you pee like you’re some * kind of dignitary. *
C: TOM
D: There’s a level of privacy that I * believe--you know what it doesn’t * matter. Keep your eyes closed. * We’re going to walk away now.
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 59.
C: GRACE *
D: Where exactly are we going? *
C: TOM
D: We need to find a knife. Then we * can cut these ties off, get rid of * that grenade, head to the docks, * bum rush the pirate guarding it, * get in the boat and head to the * next island where we can get help. *
C: GRACE *
D: Tom. That plan-- *
C: TOM
D: --has too many steps, I know. Do * you have a simpler one? *
C: GRACE *
D: * Yes. *
E: lightbulb
N: Grace yanks her ziptied hand (and both of Tom’s hands) into * Tom’s inside suit pocket pulling out: HER CELL PHONE. *
C: GRACE *
D: Find cell service. Call for help. *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM *
D: * When did you put that in my pocket? *
E: astonished
C: GRACE *
D: Right before Dog-Face Guy took us * out of the cabana, because I am a * sneaky little bitch. *
C: TOM *
D: Okay, that was good. You are a * sneaky little bitch. *
C: GRACE *
D: Thank you. *
C: TOM *
D: Keep looking up, we’re going to * start walking. I just need you to * lift your leg up, we gotta step over... a rock.
C: GRACE *
D: It’s the dead pirate, isn’t it?
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 60.
C: TOM
D: It’s the dead pirate, yes.
N: They step over the dead pirate and head into the jungle...
S: EXT. POOL - DAY *
N: Robert is out of the pool arguing with the Pirate Leader. The * hostages in the pool watch on, nervously. *
C: RICKY *
D: I think I’m gonna make a run for * it. Go get help. *
C: JAMIE *
D: What? Do not do that. That’s * stupid. They shot the last guy. *
C: RICKY *
D: But would it turn you on if I did? *
C: JAMIE *
D: Absolutely, yes. *
N: ANGLE ON the Pirate Leader, who has Robert by the arm and * SHOVES him back into the pool with a loud SPLASH. Hostages * scream. Harriett rushes up to him. *
C: HARRIETT *
D: Honey, what happened? *
C: ROBERT *
D: I refused to transfer the money. As * soon as I do, he’ll just kill us. *
C: HARRIETT *
D: * ...won’t he kill us if you don’t? *
E: nervous
N: The hostages starts looking more panicked. Carol makes eye * contact with the nearest Pirate and speaks in a loud voice. *
C: CAROL *
D: My name is Carol Elaine Fowler. I * am a wife, a mother, a grandmother * and Milford, Michigan’s Top-Selling * Realtor in 1998 and again in 2007. * I love a good G&T and have a fear * of red-headed men. *
C: ROBERT *
D: Carol, what are you doing? *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 61.
C: CAROL *
D: I’m humanizing myself to my captors. I saw it on Good Morning * America. They won’t kill you if you * humanize yourself.
N: That kicks off a whole tearful, panicked CHORUS:
C: JEANNIE DARCY’S COLLEGE FRIEND
D: I’m Jeannie and this is my My name is Jen Gardner. I am son Scotty. He has ADHD and a godmother and a woman in that’s nothing to be ashamed tech. I went to college with of. My husband Chris had to Darcy and was surprised to be stay home to work which I invited to this. But I got said I was fine with but dumped recently so I thought, * honestly I resented it-- why not--
C: RICKY
D: My name is Ricky Zirlin. I have a child... possibly? My ex says it’s not mine but I think the timeline is compelling. I met an incredible * woman last night who I feel a deep * connection with. Also I’ve recently * gotten into loose-leaf tea.
C: JAMIE
D: Really?
E: surprised, touched
C: RICKY
D: Yeah, fuck tea bags. I go loose leaf all day.
C: RENEE *
D: I am Renee Ortiz. I worked three * jobs while raising two daughters, * so now I do as little as possible. * I enjoy gin martinis and historical * non-fiction. I’ve taken a lover * recently and we only see each other * on Sundays, which is perfect. *
N: Bleeding Guy takes the chaotic moment to hoist himself out of * the pool and make another RUN for it. Rat-Face immediately * SHOOTS him in the OTHER arm. He YELPS and falls down. * ON Ricky and Jamie: *
C: JAMIE *
D: Still gonna run for it? *
C: RICKY *
D: I’m chill. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 62.
S: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
N: Tom and Grace climb over vines and logs. Grace’s free hand * holds the grenade and their zip-tied hands hold the phone. * Grace pulls their hands to her head and she pulls something * out: her hair extensions. She shoves them into Tom’s pocket. *
C: TOM *
D: ...did you just stick a loose wad * of hair in my pocket? *
C: GRACE *
D: A loose wad of incredibly expensive * custom-made hair. I need it. *
N: Tom laughs. *
C: GRACE *
D: What’s funny?
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: For a year, I’ve been agonizing * over every detail of this wedding, * and all the things that could go wrong, like, “Oh no, what if the cake is too sweet,” but I was never like: “What if we’re walking through a jungle with a grenade?”
C: GRACE *
D: Honestly, given how much you * overthink everything, I’m surprised * there wasn’t a section for this in * the wedding binder. *
C: TOM *
D: Don’t knock the wedding binder. The * wedding binder was helpful. *
C: GRACE *
D: The wedding binder was a psychosis. *
N: Grace checks the phone: Still no service. *
C: GRACE *
D: You know what this makes me think of? Remember our first Valentine’s when I tied you up--
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: Yeah, of course I remember. I think about it at least once a day.
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 63. This hangs there a little. Then:
C: GRACE *
D: This is basically what marriage is, right? Walking handcuffed through a jungle with another person who is carrying a live grenade?
C: TOM
D: More or less. Is that really so * scary? *
N: Grace laughs. Tom looks at her for a moment, wanting her to * say more, but then Grace’s dress gets snagged on a branch and * she trips, bringing Tom down with her. She drops her phone and nearly drops the grenade. Holy shit. *
C: GRACE TOM
D: I got it, I got it, I got it! You got it, you got it, you got it! *
E: CONT'D
N: They sigh in relief. That was close. Then Grace notices: *
C: GRACE *
D: A bar! We got a bar! *
E: CONT'D
N: Grace excitedly shows her phone Tom: ONE BAR of service. *
C: TOM *
D: A bar!! *
C: GRACE *
D: Shit! It’s gone. *
N: She moves their arms wildly in the sky, hoping to get the bar * back. Then her eyes lands on something with an ide. *
C: GRACE *
D: We have to go higher. *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM *
D: What? *
N: Tom turns to see what Grace is looking at: A rickety vertical * staircase with a sign that reads: “TO ZIPLINE PLATFORM.” *
C: TOM *
D: No. Grace. No. *
E: CONT'D
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 64.
S: EXT. JUNGLE ROAD - DAY *
N: Ghost-Face and Shark-Face walk up the road... right past Dog- * Face’s unconscious body, in the foliage, without knowing. *
S: EXT. ZIPLINE STAIRCASE - DAY *
N: CLOSE ON Tom, eyes closed tight, sweating bullets. *
C: TOM *
D: Anything? *
C: GRACE *
D: Yes! Wait, no. Keep going. We’re * almost at the top. *
N: REVEAL they are walking up the vertical stairs, nearing the * platform. Tom is on the verge of a panic attack. *
C: TOM *
D: Maybe we should just go back down * and try not being up high. *
N: Grace ignores him as they land on the top of the platform. *
C: GRACE *
D: We got bars! Multiple bars!! *
N: She dials. As she does, she’s startled by a piercing SHRIEK. * Then a WHOLE CHORUS OF SHRIEKS. It’s a gang of long-tailed macaque monkeys. High up in the trees, surprised to be five feet away and eye-level with a couple of humans.
C: TOM
D: Shhh! Shhhhhh!
N: ON THE JUNGLE ROAD * Shark-Face and Ghost-Face are hiking deeper into the jungle * when they hear the SHRIEKING. They look at each other and detour toward the sound... * BACK WITH TOM AND GRACE * The macaque monkeys are trying to scare Tom and Grace off, * guarding a crab they were feasting on.
C: GRACE *
D: They think we want their crab. Hey! Monkeys! Listen to me! We don’t * want your crab!
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 65. BANG! A bullet whizzes through the air, causing the monkeys * to FLEE and Grace to DROP HER PHONE. The phone falls down to * the jungle floor where we see: * Shark-Face and Ghost-Face, 500 feet ahead of them, aiming * their guns at Tom and Grace from the jungle floor. *
C: SHARK-FACE
D: Get down!
C: GRACE *
D: Sure, okay, no prob! One sec! * * We gotta zip. *
E: whispered, to Tom
C: TOM *
D: Zip? *
N: Grace head nods to the SADDLE in front of them connected to * the zipline. BANG! Another bullet flies right past them. *
C: TOM *
D: We can’t! We don’t have all the * proper equipment. *
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: Well, they have guns! *
N: BANG-BANG-BANG! Shark-Face fires more warning shots. *
C: SHARK-FACE *
D: Ay! Down. Now. *
C: GRACE *
D: Sure thing! We’re on it! *
C: TOM *
D: Grace, I just don’t think-- *
N: She’s had enough. She shoves Tom onto the saddle, straddles * him and KICKS OFF the platform. * Tom SCREAMS in terror as they CAREEN at through the jungle, * the line leading them right over the Pirates on the ground. * The Pirates SHOOT in their direction. One bullet whizzes * right past Grace’s head. * They gain speed, getting closer to the pirates. Grace makes a * silent decision. Just when they are over the pirates, Grace * trapezes upside down and releases the grenade from her hand. * The spring-loaded handle pops off as it falls! * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 66. The grenade lands right between the pirates and... *
C: KABOOM!
D: They’re blown to pieces.
N: The zipline gains speed as Grace and Tom fly off SCREAMING. *
S: EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY
N: The hostages cry out in horror and the pirates stare stunned * at the trail of smoke snaking up over the distant jungle. *
C: PIRATE LEADER
D: What the hell was that?
E: into his walkie-talkie
N: No reply. Uh oh. He’s angry now. Everything is going wrong. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: * We go check it out. *
E: CONT'D to Clown-Face
N: The Pirate Leader aims his gun at the hostages and shouts: *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: Everyone! Go deeper in the pool! *
E: CONT'D
N: The hostages swim to the deep end, terrified. Renee, * seemingly frozen in fear, stays in the shallow end. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: I said GO!! *
E: CONT'D
C: ROBERT / JAMIE *
D: Renee!! / Mom!! *
C: RENEE *
D: I don’t like getting my hair wet! *
C: CAROL *
D: Yoohoo, Renee! Take this! *
E: O.C.
N: ANGLE ON Carol, lounging in a floatie. She pushes a matching * floatie to Renee, who takes it graciously. * The Pirate Leader rushes toward the jeep with Tiger-Face. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: Fucking Americans... *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 67. Clown-Face starts up the jeep as the Pirate Leader hops in * and they speed into the jungle towards the smoke. * Tiger-Face and Rat-Face stay back to guard the pool. Tiger- * Face throws a few more floaties and noodles to the hostages. *
S: EXT. JUNGLE / BEACH - DAY *
N: Grace and Tom are FLYING down the zipline. They careen toward * a zipline platform by the ocean. Grace dismounts perfectly, * like a superhero. Tom falls off the saddle, flat on his back. *
C: TOM *
D: I will never understand why people * pay actual money to do that-- *
C: GRACE *
D: Tom, look... *
N: Tom turns around to see they landed right where the ceremony * was supposed to take place. Literally right in front of the * rows of rented white chairs. * They see purses left behind in the chaos. Tom sees a plastic water cup with “Carol” written in sharpie. His poor mom. The refreshments table with a white table cloth and a glass * dispenser of cucumber water. The wooden arch covered with * flowers, wilting in the hot sun. Tom looks at Grace and sees her eyes are glassy. It’s * emotional being here. The wedding that never was.
S: EXT. CRATER - DAY
N: The Pirate Leader and Clown-Face stand at a crater of gore, * trying to make sense of this gruesome tableau. They see parts * of their comrades, but no trace of Tom and Grace. *
C: CLOWN-FACE *
D: I thought you said these were dumb * tourists. *
N: He lifts a shredded mask of one of his men. Affected.
C: PIRATE LEADER
D: My information was wrong. These * people are sick. You find them, but * I kill them. Understood? *
N: Then they hear RUSTLING in the banana trees. They all aim their guns... ready for anything... Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 68. ...when out staggers Dog-Face, with his burned face.
C: DOG-FACE
D: You can have the man. The bride is mine.
S: EXT. BEACH - DAY
N: Tom holds the silver faucet open and gulps down water from * the big glass vat on the refreshments table. Grace looks out at the shimmering ocean to the next island on * the horizon, with lots of colorful sails. It’s a busy marina. *
C: GRACE *
D: Police... Coast Guard... They’re all right there.
C: TOM *
D: We’ll make it, we just have to-- *
C: PIRATE VOICE
D: Carol Fowler! Be quiet!
E: O.S.
N: Grace and Tom look at each other, surprised. They whisper: *
C: GRACE TOM
D: Carol? Mom? *
N: Grace and Tom follow the sound of the voice up a hillside. As * they crest the hill, they see the pool through palm fronds:
C: GRACE *
D: Oh my god. *
E: CONT'D under her breath
N: All their loved ones are huddled shivering in the pool in their fancy clothes. Pirates pace with guns. *
C: TOM *
D: Are our moms on floaties? *
N: ANGLE ON Carol and Renee, indeed both on floaties. *
C: TOM
D: This is all my fault... *
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: It’s not just you, they’re here for * us. My poor mom. She thought she * could avoid my dad all weekend... *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 69.
C: TOM
D: Oh? She didn’t want to be held hostage with him in a pool?
N: Grace stares at her parents in the pool, turned away from * each other. *
C: GRACE *
D: This one time I saw a video of my * mom and dad when they were young... * before they got married, before all * the fighting started... they were * dancing at a party and they just * seemed so happy. So in love. My mom * was watching that video the night * my dad left. He broke her heart. *
N: Grace tries to fight the emotion. She can’t look Tom in the * eye, so she stares forward at her parents in the pool.
C: GRACE *
D: I loved our relationship so much, * Tom, I just was scared if we got * married... I didn’t want to ruin * it. But we ruined it anyway. *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: Grace... *
N: Grace shakes off her tears and puts up her tough veneer. *
C: GRACE *
D: It’s fine, we don’t have time for * this. We have to keep moving. *
C: TOM
D: Hang on. Look. *
N: Grace looks where Tom is pointing: Robert giving Renee his * straw hat. He gives her a warm smile. She nods at him, * grateful. Grace can’t believe it-- the first nice moment * between her parents in years.
C: TOM
D: Oh. Also...
E: CONT'D
N: Tom points. ANGLE ON Ricky blocking Jamie from the sun.
C: TOM
D: What’s going on there?
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: Oh yeah, that happened last night. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 70.
C: TOM
D: That is a trainwreck and I love it. *
C: GRACE *
D: Me too. *
N: ANGLE ON Tom’s nephew, Scotty, who suddenly spots Tom and Grace through the palms. He gets excited and waves at them. *
C: SCOTTY *
D: Hey! Uncle Tom!
E: calling out
N: Everyone in the pool turns around, looking towards where he’s pointing. Rat-Face spots them and races toward them. *
C: GRACE TOM
D: Shit! Go! Go! Go! *
C: DARCY *
D: Which way?! *
C: TOM *
D: The kitchen! *
S: INT. RESORT KITCHEN - DAY
N: Tom and Grace sneak into the resort kitchen. It’s a MESS: * The stove is on, left by the cooks who were taken hostage. * Sinks are running over. Cold appetizers sit on the counters. * They turn off the stove and the sink and looks through * drawers. Grace pulls him toward the appetizers. *
C: TOM
D: We just need to get a knife... what * are you doing?
C: GRACE *
D: I’m starving. Did you eat anything * today?
C: TOM
D: No. I’m not hungry.
C: GRACE *
D: Eat.
N: Grace puts a tray in front of him. They both eat ravenously. *
C: TOM
D: I am hungry. You’re right.
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 71.
C: GRACE *
D: Most couples never get to eat at their own wedding!
N: Suddenly, the SOUND of pirates outside-- boots and a voice on * a walkie-talkie. Grace and Tom freeze. Grace pulls him to... * THE WALK-IN FRIDGE They swing open the heavy door and see: A perfect tiered wedding cake on a rolling cart. * Tom looks under the rolling cart and sees the cake knife set with a post-it note from his mom on the top: “Don’t forget! Love, Carol (Mom).” Tom points at it. Grace gets emotional. *
C: GRACE *
D: I love your mom.
E: CONT'D
N: Grace grabs the knife and tries to cut the ziptie with her * free hand. She awkwardly saws but it doesn’t penetrate the * hard plastic. She saws harder.
C: GRACE *
D: I can’t do it with my left hand. *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM *
D: I can’t do it with any hands. *
N: Grace sees Rat-Face outside a window, searching for them. * They duck their heads down to hide from view. * And then Tom sees through the door back in the kitchen: An * INDUSTRIAL MEAT SLICER. His eyes light up. * OUTSIDE * Rat-Face creeps past the kitchen doors slowly, eyes wide, * listening closely. Hunting with determination. * IN THE KITCHEN * Tom and Grace hold out their connected wrists inches from the * meat slicer’s massive circular blade. Grace looks panicked. *
C: GRACE *
D: Is this a bad idea? *
C: TOM *
D: Yes. You ready? *
C: GRACE *
D: No. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 72. Grace cautiously presses a button. The blade WHIRRS to life. * They slowly slide their wrists toward the rapidlt spinning * blade. It’s terrifying. Grace yanks them back. *
C: GRACE *
D: Hang on, hang on, new idea: what if * we just stay ziptied? *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM *
D: Grace. We can do this. *
N: She nods and puts their wrists back on the surface and slowly * move toward the blade. ON TOM, staring straight ahead... *
C: TOM *
D: Are your eyes closed? *
E: CONT'D
N: ON GRACE, opening her closed eyes. *
C: GRACE *
D: Nope. *
N: As they make contact, Grace FLINCHES, pulling Tom’s wrist a * centimeter closer to the blade. Before she can correct it... * SWISH. The blade cuts through the zip-ties and slices deep * into Tom’s hand. Tom goes sheet-white. Shuts his eyes. *
C: TOM
D: Aaaaahhh.
E: muffled cry
N: OUTSIDE * Rat-Face hears the cry inside the kitchen and rushes back * toward the door. * IN THE KITCHEN * Tom, in intense pain, whispers to Grace. He can’t look. *
C: TOM *
D: How bad is it?
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: Ummm?
N: Grace looks at Tom’s hand GUSHING BLOOD down her dress. NOPE. * Grace passes out and hits the floor just as... * Rat-Face KICKS OPEN the kitchen door. Tom DUCKS behind the * kitchen island before Rat-Face can see him. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 73. As Rat-Face skulks by the other side of the island, Tom drags * Grace across the floor to hide, but then sees: * He’s mopping the floor with her bloody wedding dress, leaving * a streaky trail. He’s out of options. * Rat-Face curiously walks over to the whirring meat-slicer. As * he does, he nearly trips over: * Grace on the floor in her wedding dress in a pool of blood. * Rat-Face looks back at the meat slicer. And the down again at * the bloody bride. What the hell happened? * He aims his gun and gives her a kick to see if she’s dead. * Grace stirs awake to see Rat-Face standing over her with the * barrel of his shotgun pointed at her. She looks around. *
C: GRACE *
D: ...Tom?
E: CONT'D
N: He’s gone. She’s going to die. Alone. Then Rat-Face GASPS, stiffens, and falls forward, landing inches from Grace with Carol’s cake knife IN HIS BACK. * Grace looks up and sees Tom standing over them with his * wounded hand in his white tuxedo jacket pocket stained red. He tries to act like he’s not about to pass out.
C: TOM
D: Right here.
N: Grace’s eyes water. So relieved. He helps her up, and even * though they’re not ziptied anymore, their hands linger. *
C: GRACE *
D: I thought you left. *
C: TOM
D: Never. *
N: This hits Grace. They hold eye contact, and then Tom looks * down at the dead pirate. He puts his shoe on the pirate’s * back and pulls the cake knife out. *
C: TOM *
D: Oh fuck, oh God, I’m sorry, sir. *
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: Hey, can I borrow that knife? *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 74. Tom hands her the knife, curious. She cleans it off with a * towel, hikes her dress and slices through her suffocating * shape wear. She can finally breathe... It’s been hours. *
C: GRACE *
D: Spanx are the devil’s work. *
E: CONT'D
N: She throws the shapewear at the buzzing meat slicer and it * rips into tatters. *
C: GRACE *
D: * Can you get those boots off him?
E: CONT'D nodding to the pirate
N: Grace saws off the bottom two feet of her dress. Tom yanks * off the dead Pirate’s combat boots and passes them to Grace. * He looks through the pirate’s pockets and steals the walkie- * talkie. And then he finds something else: a paper invitation * to Tom and Grace’s wedding. Huh. That’s weird. *
C: GRACE *
D: That’s better. *
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: Tom turns around to see in the surreal sight of his fiancée: * Messy cropped hair, combat boots, a blood-streaked and * shredded wedding dress, holding Rat-Face’s shotgun. Grace * notices Tom gawking at her. *
C: GRACE *
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: That dress is growing on me.
C: GRACE *
D: Yeah? You like it? I wanted something less traditional.
C: TOM
D: I think you got there.
N: They hear a pirate coming and hurry out a back door just * missing the pirate pursuing them: Dog-Face. Out for blood. *
S: EXT. RESORT LOBBY - BACK SIDE - CONTINUOUS *
N: They scan the area and see: a house tucked away behind the * pool. They rush inside. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 75.
S: INT. HOUSE - DAY *
N: They enter a charming home filled with plants, knick-knacks, * framed photos. Grace looks at one: it’s a photo of Marge. * They peek into a room to find Marge’s office. Tom rushes over * to the computer. *
C: TOM *
D: Maybe she has a separate internet * connection... *
N: With his bloody hands, he clicks the mouse and checks the * connection. No luck. *
C: TOM *
D: Nope. But wow does Marge love * Corgis. *
E: CONT'D
N: ANGLE ON: Marge’s computer desktop, which is a collage of * Corgi pictures. She also has a Corgi mousepad and a coffee * mug shaped like a Corgi. * Grace peeks out the shutters to the jungle and sees Dog-Face * and Tiger-Face searching through the trees. *
C: GRACE *
D: We’re trapped. What do we do? *
C: TOM *
D: I don’t know... *
N: Suddenly a trap door in the floor CREAKS open below them. * Grace reels around to shoot but her gun is grabbed by-- * Marge! Holding one of Tom’s DIY mason jar lanterns. She holds a finger to her mouth like “Shhh.” Then waves them in.
S: INT. PANIC ROOM - DAY
N: Grace and Tom descend into the dirt-walled panic room. There * are a few shovels and a tunnel.
C: GRACE TOM
D: You saved our lives! Marge! Ace! Oh my God! *
N: Ace flashes Tom a gold tooth smile. He’s holding a mason jar lantern and a shovel. Marge is desperate for information:
C: MARGE
D: How many are there?
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 76.
C: GRACE *
D: We don’t know. There were two in * the lobby. A couple more by the * pool watching the hostages. One by * the docks. But we got four.
C: ACE
D: What do you mean “got”?
C: GRACE *
D: Got them to... stop being... alive.
E: can’t say the word
C: ACE
D: Holy shit.
C: TOM *
D: We haven’t seen any of your staff * though. *
C: ACE *
D: I saw ‘em getting locked in the * spa. *
C: MARGE
D: They never bother with locals. Not * worth it. Americans are the rich * idiots. No offense. *
C: TOM
D: None taken. Do you have a first aid * kit down here?
E: woozy
C: MARGE
D: I got some headache medicine. And duct tape. And gum? *
C: TOM
D: The pills and the tape please. *
C: GRACE *
D: I’ll take the gum. *
N: Ace hands Tom the pill bottle. He shakes a few into his * mouth. Grace pops the gum and then rips a piece of gauzy lace * from her dress. *
C: GRACE *
D: Gimme your hand.
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: No, it’s okay, it’s so bloody-- *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 77.
C: GRACE *
D: Tom. I can do it. Sickness and health, right?
E: a meaningful beat
N: Tom extracts his bloody hand from his jacket.
C: ACE
D: Oof, they got ya good, huh?
C: GRACE *
D: Actually this one was me.
N: Grace takes a breath and gently cleans the wound. *
C: TOM
D: It’s got a loose flap, just be careful with the flap--
C: GRACE *
D: Please stop saying “flap”. I’m totally fine but don’t say “flap”.
N: Grace pulls a stretch of duct-tape with her teeth. Tom bites * his sleeve and Grace starts to tape up his hand. *
C: MARGE
D: I’m so sorry this is happening--
C: GRACE *
D: Don’t. It’s not your fault. It’s nobody’s fault.
C: MARGE
D: I just don’t get why they’re still here. Last time, the pirates were * here for half hour! Loot and go. * Twenty minutes. Gone.
N: Grace freezes, mid-duct-tape... *
C: GRACE *
D: What do you mean last time?
C: MARGE
D: Last year. I can’t believe it. Two thousand islands in the Philippines and they hit us twice?? It’s not * fair!
C: GRACE *
D: This happened last summer... AND YOU LET US HAVE OUR WEDDING HERE???
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 78.
C: MARGE
D: What do you mean? We... talked about it...
N: Grace looks to Tom but he’s staring up at the wooden * floorboards overhead. Avoiding eye contact.
C: GRACE *
D: YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS???
C: TOM
D: Shhhh. Let’s just all take a deep--
N: Grace squeezes his wounded hand -- pissed. Tom suppresses a * SCREAM. * OUTSIDE THE HOUSE * Dog-Face hears noises coming from the house and heads over. * IN THE PANIC ROOM *
C: TOM *
D: First of all. No one was killed. And we both agreed the odds of it happening again were VERY small--
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: Who’s “we”???
C: TOM
D: Me and Marge. We emailed. And I asked some tough questions, but--
C: GRACE *
D: Why didn’t you tell me?! *
C: TOM
D: * Well, you didn’t tell me you were * having doubts about getting * married. So. *
E: defensive
N: This sets Grace off. Something is released in her: *
C: GRACE *
D: You’re right, I didn’t. You know * why? Because you were so excited * about this fucking wedding. You * were excited about the fucking * flowers and the fucking fireworks * and the fucking live band. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 79.
C: MARGE
D: The live band wasn’t included in * the package you chose. *
E: quietly
C: GRACE *
D: --And I didn’t tell you I was freaking out, because all year you’ve been in your head about * everything. You thought my dad * hated you and then you acted all * weird around him. You thought you * were getting dropped from your team * and then you played badly. You * decide something bad is going to * happen and then it does. *
C: ACE *
D: That’s called self-sabotage. *
C: GRACE *
D: Thank you, Ace. It is. And the one * thing you cared about was this * wedding and I knew if I told you * how I was feeling, you would * sabotage our whole relationship. * Which you did anyway. *
C: TOM
D: I didn’t sabotage anything! This * wedding got ruined the minute Sean * showed up. *
C: GRACE *
D: Oh my God, stop talking about Sean! * None of this is about Sean! Why * can’t you just believe me when I * tell you I love you and I want to * be with you? And-- and-- * You know what else? Why do you buy so much stuff on Amazon and never * break down the boxes? You just leave them by the door, like there’s going to be a magical box * fairy that takes them all away. *
E: she’s on a roll now
C: TOM
D: I thought you liked breaking down boxes?
C: GRACE *
D: Who likes breaking down boxes?
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 80.
C: ACE
D: I do. I like the sound it makes.
C: GRACE *
D: And those jeans you bought on sale a few weeks ago were women’s jeans-- *
C: TOM
D: I found them in the men’s section--
C: GRACE *
D: They’re flared! You looked like fucking Sheryl Crow.
C: TOM
D: Well, I love Sheryl Crow, so that’s * a compliment. And just so you know * I hated that haircut you got last year. It made your head look square. You looked like a Simpson. And you’re the least romantic person I’ve ever met. Your idea of romance is taking your shirt off and saying: “Let’s do this.”
C: GRACE *
D: Well, good thing you don’t have to * see me or my perfect boobs ever * again. *
C: TOM
D: Great! Maybe I’ll find someone * nice, who likes candles and soaps-- *
C: GRACE *
D: “Candles and soaps”? Are you going * to marry a Bath and Body Works? *
C: TOM
D: Marry? Oh no, no, no. If we * survive, I’m going to be drunk for a year and I’m going to make some really bad decisions.
C: GRACE *
D: It doesn’t matter now. Everyone we love could die because of this stupid wedding.
N: That hangs in the air... Tom’s eyes are glassy.
C: TOM
D: You mean because of me.
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 81. Grace doesn’t say it. But yeah. That’s what she means. * Suddenly they hear a DOOR OPEN and floorboards CREAK. * IN THE HOUSE * Dog-Face looks around the office and sees BLOOD on the * keyboard and the mouse. *
C: DOG-FACE *
D: They’re in the manager’s house. *
E: into his walkie-talkie
N: But then hears his own MUFFLED VOICE echo back to him. He * flips around, confused where the noise came from. * IN THE PANIC ROOM * Tom turns down the volume of the stolen walkie-talkie. Then * holds his breath. They all do. Praying the guy didn’t notice. * IN THE HOUSE * Dog-Face is suspicious. He exits the office and opens a door * to a closet. Nothing. Clown-Face rushes inside the house. Dog- * Face holds up a finger to be silent. * IN THE HOUSE * Tom holds the walkie-talkie to his ear, on a much lower * volume. He hears Pirates talking but it’s not English.
C: TOM
D: I think he heard it.
C: GRACE *
D: Why?
C: TOM
D: Because they stopped speaking English.
N: Tom hands the walkie to Ace, then looks into the tunnel. *
C: TOM
D: We gotta get out of here. Where does that tunnel go?
E: CONT'D
C: MARGE
D: Tell him where your tunnel goes.
E: to Ace
C: ACE
D: Oh now it’s my tunnel...
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 82.
C: MARGE
D: Nowhere. He was supposed to finish it before the season started but he * never did.
N: Tom grabs a mason jar lantern for light, hunches down into the tunnel. It goes about twelve feet before dead-ending. * Shovels and planks of plywood sit against the dead end. *
C: ACE
D: I’m almost done! Three more feet * and we’re through to the outside.
C: MARGE *
D: And does that help us now, Ace? *
C: ACE *
D: No. *
C: TOM
D: We need to start digging.
N: Grace grabs a shovel and gets to work. She’s still pissed at * him but this is life and death.
C: TOM
D: Marge, give her some light.
E: CONT'D
N: Tom hands Marge his mason jar lantern and she heads into the tunnel with Grace. Ace has the walkie-talkie to his ear. *
C: TOM
D: What are they saying? *
E: CONT'D
C: ACE *
D: No clue. I don’t know what language * that is, but it ain’t Filipino.
N: Tom’s baffled. But there’s no time. He hears the footsteps. * They’re distant. In the other room. He makes a decision. *
C: TOM *
D: No one move. *
N: He pushes the hatch above his head slightly open and peeks * out. No one there. Grace whispers at him, panicked. *
C: GRACE *
D: What are you doing??
C: TOM
D: This is the only way. They know someone’s here.
E: MORE
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 83.
C: TOM
D: But they don’t know we all are. I’m sorry about everything. *
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: Tom! Hang on! We were having a * fight! You can’t just stop the fight and sacrifice yourself for me! That’s not fair! *
N: Not listening, Tom hands Grace the shotgun and hoists himself * out of the hatch and closes it. * IN THE OFFICE NOW * Tom pushes the heavy desk over the hatch so it can’t be re- * opened. He creeps into the living room and spots Dog-Face and * Clown-Face in the kitchen, with their backs to him. *
C: TOM
D: Hey, Dog-Face Guy! It’s me, the * groom from earlier? *
N: They turn around and train their guns on him. *
C: TOM *
D: And you must be Tiger-Face Guy. A * pleasure. My name is Tom and I * would really like it if no one else * got hurt so I am going to * surrender, okay?
E: CONT'D
N: They stick their guns to his back aggressively and walk him * out of the house. *
S: INT. TUNNEL - SAME TIME
N: Grace’s ear is pressed up against the hatch. She hears them * march Tom out of the house. *
C: GRACE *
D: * They didn’t kill him! He’s still * alive! Oh my god... I’m going to * kill him.
E: emotional, relieved
N: Grace smiles, overwhelmed by what Tom did for her. She grabs * a shovel and starts shoveling with determination. *
S: EXT. RESORT POOL - DAY
N: Tom is walked out to the pool by Dog-Face and Tiger-Face at * gunpoint. The hostages are shocked-- * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 84.
C: WEDDING GUESTS *
D: Tom! / Are you okay?? / Where’s * Grace? / I really have to pee. *
C: TOM
D: Heyyy... Everyone having fun at the wedding?
N: The Pirate Leader walks up to Tom with a stapler in hand. Tom flinches, but the Leader just staples his name card to his * bloody tux jacket: “Groom”
C: PIRATE LEADER
D: Where’s your bride?
C: TOM
D: Fuck if I know. *
N: The guests react: What’s going on? *
C: TOM
D: As soon as she cut through the zipties, she was gone. She wanted * to get the hell away from me. She took most of my hand with her.
E: CONT'D
N: Tom nods to his duct-taped hand.
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: You are a bad liar. *
C: CAROL *
D: * He really is. *
E: whispered to Larry
C: SEAN
D: Tom, if you know something, please * tell them. The best thing we can do is cooperate. They just want money. *
N: Tom looks at Sean and in spite of everything, smiles. *
C: TOM *
D: You’re right, Sean. Thank you as * always for being a voice of reason. * * Okay, I’ll tell you where she is. *
E: then, to Pirate Leader
N: Tom approaches the Pirate Leader and leans in to whisper so * only he can hear: *
C: TOM
D: Bercinta kakekmu. *
E: CONT'D
N: Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 85. The Pirate Leader UZI-whips Tom’s jaw. Ouch. Then throws him into the pool with the rest of the hostages.
C: SEAN
D: Jesus. What did you say to him?
N: Tom adjusts his jacket but we see he’s actually pulled the tattered floral boutonniere from his lapel. Up to something.
C: TOM
D: Hard to explain. Sort of an inside joke. Can you give me a hand, * buddy? Feeling a little woozy. *
N: Tom puts an arm around Sean’s shoulder to support himself in the water. But it was a trap! Tom gets Sean in a choke-hold, and holds the sharp pin of the boutonniere an inch from Sean’s eye.
C: SEAN
D: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING--
N: Tom strains to hold Sean.
C: TOM
D: Stop moving or you lose the eye.
N: Sean stops struggling and goes cross-eyed staring at the needle an inch from his eye. Panicked.
C: SEAN
D: They’ll kill you!
C: TOM
D: Now why would they do that?
N: All the guests SCREAM at Tom. The Pirates aim their guns at him, alarmed and confused.
C: CAROL
D: Tom! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
C: TOM
D: You want to explain or should I?
C: SEAN
D: EXPLAIN. WHAT.
C: TOM *
D: Sean hired these pirates to invade * the wedding and get Robert’s money. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 86.
C: SEAN *
D: Whoooaa, Tom, that is a serious * accusation. But it’s okay. Jealousy * can get the better of all of us. *
C: TOM *
D: I’m not jealous!! *
N: The guests (and some pirate) trade looks: he sounds jealous. *
C: SEAN *
D: It’s natural to see me as a threat * because Grace and I shared * something transcendent, but I’m not * the bad guy here. And I certainly * am not involved with these pirates. *
C: TOM
D: Oh yeah? Then why did that pirate * deck me when I told him to go fuck * his grandpa? *
C: WEDDING GUESTS
D: What did you think he was gonna do? / Why’d you say that? / Huh?
C: TOM *
D: I said it in Balinese! These pirate * aren’t local, they’re from Bali. * That’s why they separated us from the staff. They would have known * these guys were imposters. Marge * said the pirates just looted and * left last time. It took 20 minutes. *
C: CAROL
D: What do you mean “last time”? *
C: TOM
D: Pirates hit this place last summer.
C: RENEE
D: And you had your wedding here???
E: like mother, like daughter
C: TOM *
D: That’s not-- that’s off topic! * These pirates are different. * They’re heavily armed. They’re only * after Robert’s money. It didn’t add * up. Until I found this. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 87. Everyone waits for something dramatic to happen but nothing * does. Tom, still holding Sean, whispers to Ricky. *
C: TOM *
D: Ricky, will you grab the paper in * my front pocket? *
E: CONT'D
C: RICKY *
D: Oh, for sure. *
N: Ricky grabs a paper sticking out of Tom’s front pocket: Tom * and Grace’s wedding invitation. *
C: RENEE *
D: * Your own wedding invitation? *
E: unimpressed
C: TOM *
D: Yes. But I found it on one of the * pirates. Now how did a pirate get a * hold of our wedding invitation? It * had to be given to him by an * invited guest. And not just anyone: * the only guest who didn’t RSVP. * * Will you open it... *
E: quietly to Ricky
N: Ricky opens invitation and the RSVP card falls out. *
C: TOM *
D: * And hold it up. *
E: CONT'D quietly to Ricky
N: Ricky triumphantly holds it up. Now Tom is back in his mode. *
C: TOM *
D: This asshat thought it was * appropriate to show up to a wedding * he didn’t RSVP to. *
E: CONT'D
C: CAROL *
D: * He didn’t RSVP?! *
E: gasping
C: JEANNIE *
D: I don’t think that’s the main * issue, Mom. *
C: CAROL *
D: I can be upset about many things at * the same time. I also don’t love * that hair color on you. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 88.
C: TOM
D: Prince Charming brought some of his * buddies over to crash the wedding and get a big fat ransom from his * best buddy Robert. *
C: ROBERT *
D: * He asked me for money for an * investment months ago. I said no. *
E: contemplative
C: SEAN *
D: Robert, come on... You can’t * possibly think... *
N: Robert is scowling at Sean. He looks around the pool, looking * for an ally. Everyone stares at him, horrified. *
C: SEAN *
D: Okay, well-- *
E: CONT'D
N: Sean HEADBUTTS Tom, breaking out of the chokehold. The * hostages GASP and SCREAM. * Pirates haul Tom out of the pool and train their guns on him. * Sean wades out and Dog-Face hands him a towel to dry off. * A hush falls over the hostages, stunned by the revelation. *
C: SEAN *
D: You’re really fucking annoying, you * know that? *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM *
D: I do, yes, thank you. *
S: INT. TUNNEL - DAY
N: Grace digs with a fury. Ace spreads the dirt out as they go. * Marge lights the way with a mason jar lantern. *
C: MARGE
D: I thought mason jars at weddings were over, but these are adorable! Did you make these?
N: Grace glances back at the lantern. For some reason this * compliment makes Grace cry. *
C: GRACE *
D: Tom made them. He wanted us to have the perfect wedding and I messed everything up...
E: MORE
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 89.
C: GRACE
D: Well, he messed everything up, and then I messed everything up, and * then him again. I don’t know how it * got so hard.
E: CONT'D
C: ACE *
D: It can be hard sometimes. Marge * kept nagging me about this tunnel-- *
C: MARGE *
D: I don’t nag, I remind * enthusiastically. *
C: GRACE *
D: Wait, are you two... married...?
C: ACE
D: Had our wedding on this very island * in 1993-- *
C: MARGE ACE
D: --4. --94. *
E: CONT'D
N: Grace’s surprised. She takes a break from digging, hands the * shovel to Ace. Wipes the sweat and dirt off her face.
C: GRACE *
D: Wow. That’s a long time. You must * have something really special. *
C: MARGE *
D: Not really. *
C: ACE *
D: * Hey. *
E: offended
C: MARGE
D: I mean, yes, it is special. But * it’s not magic. Marriage isn’t as * scary and complicated as you think. * You want to be married for 30 years? All you gotta do is not get divorced.
C: ACE
D: That’s true. Sometimes I wanna kill this woman. But I don’t wanna divorce her. I like her too much.
N: Grace takes this in. * BACK AT THE POOL * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 90. Tom sits in a pool chair as the Pirate Leader holds a gun to * his head. Sean watches.
C: SEAN
D: You’re in the big leagues now, Tom.
C: TOM
D: Oh wow, never heard that one before.
E: rolls his eyes
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: Tell us where she is. *
C: TOM
D: I don’t know where she is... What I do know... is Filipino Tylenol is no joke. I feel like my face is falling off.
N: The Pirate Leader clocks him with the back of his gun. Then Tom sees... twenty feet away... a sinkhole forming. Oh * shit. It’s Grace digging. She’s gonna pop out in plain view. *
C: TOM
D: Fine! I’ll tell you. After we cut * ourselves loose, Grace and I got * into a fight. She took off in a * golf cart looking for cell * reception on the Northern coast * near the cliffs. And I came back * here to try to rescue everyone. *
E: CONT'D
N: Sean studies a stoic Tom: Does he believe him? *
C: SEAN *
D: Trying to play the hero. That’s * cute, Tommy. *
N: Tom looks over to Carol, who silently mouths “Good one.” * Impressed by his lie. He smiles. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: We take the chopper to find her. *
C: SEAN *
D: I’m coming. I’ve watched you fuck * this up all day. We’re doing this * my way now... * * We need collateral. *
E: wheels turning
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 91. The Pirate Leader narrows his eyes at Sean, angry. Sean scans * the hostages in the pool and lands on one. *
C: SEAN *
D: * Get the wife. *
E: CONT'D to Clown-Face
N: Clown-Face grabs Harriett from the pool. *
C: ROBERT *
D: Wait, stop! Get off her! *
C: HARRIETT *
D: Please, no! I’m-- I’m just a * wellness coach! *
N: Clown-Face hauls Harriett away. The Pirate Leader follows. * Sean turns back to Robert. *
C: SEAN *
D: If the money isn’t in my account * when I get back, she’s dead. *
C: ROBERT *
D: * You were like a son to me. *
E: disgusted
C: SEAN *
D: Sorry, now you’re stuck with Tom. *
N: Sean climbs into the helicopter and it takes off. The sound * is deafening. Wind blows Tom’s hair back... makes waves in * the crowded pool... Tiger-Face and Dog-Face stay behind to guard the hostages. * Suddenly, they hear a SCRAPING NOISE, turn, and see a shovel * stab out of the grass-- Grace crawls out of the earth in a dirt-covered, ripped, and * bloody wedding dress. Brandishing a shotgun. *
C: GRACE *
D: I told you: you can’t just leave in the middle of a fight, Tom!
N: She squints into the blinding sunlight, trying to find Tom. The pirates point their guns at her, and she points her gun * at them. It’s a stand-off. She looks strong, confident. She’s almost unrecognizable, in an awesome way.
C: RENEE
D: Honey? Where did you come from? *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 92.
C: GRACE *
D: Hi Mom! Oh I got trapped in this * unfinished tunnel. But I’m okay! I * have this gun now, look! *
N: She brandishes the gun. It goes off, grazing Jamie’s ear.
C: JAMIE DARCY
D: What the fuck? Oh whoops! *
C: JAMIE
D: DID YOU JUST SHOOT ME?
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: Not on purpose! Guns are confusing! * Hey everybody. Tom and I called off * the wedding.
C: RENEE CAROL
D: What did Tom do to you? Why is it just Tom’s fault? *
C: ROBERT JAMIE
D: Did he abandon you in the I totally called this. tunnel? *
C: GRACE *
D: Stop it! I’m tired of all of your * opinions! This was supposed to be * our wedding. And yes, we called it * off, and yes, pirates invaded it, * but it was a mess before all that. * Mom, Dad, apologize to Tom. *
C: RENEE
D: What? Why?
C: GRACE *
D: For not making him feel welcome in this family and complaining and * just generally being selfish dicks-- *
C: ROBERT
D: Honey, there are more pressing-- *
N: Grace waves the gun around wildly. *
C: GRACE *
D: Apologize! He saved my life today. And he’s the best person I know. And if you say one more bad thing about him, I will shoot you like I shot Jamie.
N: Tom can’t help smiling. It’s crazy, but cool. Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 93.
C: RENEE/ROBERT/JAMIE
D: I’m so sorry, Tom./ Very sorry, * Tom./ What the fuck is happening. *
C: TOM
D: Thanks guys. That means a lot.
C: GRACE *
D: And Carol, Larry!
N: Grace waves the gun in their direction and then realizes: *
C: GRACE *
D: Actually I’m not upset with you, * this was more about my family, but * we should get lunch or something-- *
E: CONT'D
C: CAROL
D: Of course! Lunch sounds great! *
E: freaked out
C: GRACE *
D: And I know you have a perfect marriage, which is hard for anyone * to live up to... *
C: CAROL *
D: Who told you we had a perfect marriage?
C: TOM
D: Oh come on, I’ve only seen you fight one time, and it was about who is nicer to the dog. How is your marriage not perfect?
C: LARRY
D: I made love to your Aunt Marie.
C: CAROL
D: He did, yeah. He had sex with my sister, so I went out and did some pretty bad things with Jim Roberts.
C: TOM GRACE
D: WHAT? Oh my god, seriously? *
C: LARRY
D: You and Jim Roberts went on for a few years, wasn’t it?
C: CAROL
D: Yeah, we just couldn’t get enough of each other. Our bodies just fit.
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 94.
C: TOM
D: YOUR BODIES WHAT?
C: JAMIE RICKY
D: That’s how I feel about you, Right back atcha, babe. Ricky. *
C: CAROL
D: But, in the end, he just wasn’t your dad, and Aunt Marie realized she had a sex addiction, poor angel, and we all figured it out.
C: TOM
D: * Oh my god.
E: world crumbling
N: Grace smiles, satisfied. *
C: GRACE *
D: Wow, these are some incredible * breakthroughs. I’m proud of us. *
N: Grace squints to see pirates heading toward her, guns aimed. *
C: GRACE *
D: Okay, I am clearly outnumbered so * I’m gonna put my gun down. You guys * can kidnap me now.
E: CONT'D
N: She drops her gun and Dog-Face grabs her by the hair. *
C: DOG-FACE
D: Remember me? You lit my face on * fire.
C: GRACE *
D: I still feel bad about that.
N: Dog-Face unceremoniously SHOVES Grace in the pool. She lands * next to Tom. Now out of the sun, Grace takes in the scene. *
C: GRACE *
D: Are we missing people? *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM *
D: Oh yeah... about that. * * I hate to be the one to tell you * this, but... Sean is an asshole. *
E: full smile
N: Dog-Face pulls Marge and Ace out of the hole, as he talks * into his walkie-talkie. Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 95.
C: DOG-FACE *
D: We have bride. Do you copy?
S: INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
N: The walkie-talkie clipped onto the Pirate’s Leader’s bullet proof vest can’t be heard over the ENGINE. The Pirate Leader is clipped in, hanging out the open door with a machine gun, eyes peeled for Grace in a golf cart. * Sean has his arm around a frightened-looking Harriett’s neck. * BACK TO SCENE: Tom finishes catching Grace up. *
C: TOM *
D: So Sean is off trying to find you. * I told him you took the golf cart * to the north coast. *
C: GRACE *
D: You lied and they believed you?? *
C: TOM *
D: * Yes! I lied really well! *
E: beaming
C: GRACE *
D: Baby, I’m so proud of you! *
N: They beam at each other. The other hostages don’t get why. *
C: GRACE *
D: * So okay, these guys are Balinese... * Sean is full of shit... and he took * Harriett as a hostage? That doesn’t * make sense. *
E: CONT'D wheels turning
C: TOM *
D: I know it’s hard to accept you * could have dated someone so awful. *
C: GRACE *
D: No, that part I get. I had very bad * taste in men before you. *
C: JAMIE *
D: Oh yeah, remember that Australian * DJ you dated who is convinced the * world is flat? *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 96.
C: GRACE * Yes, DJ Truther. *
D: * I mean-- it doesn’t make sense why * Sean took Harriett with him as a * hostage. She was already being held * hostage here. *
E: then, to Tom
N: Grace gestures to the pirates guarding the pool with guns. *
C: TOM *
D: ...Maybe he wanted to take her * extra hostage? *
C: LARRY *
D: Oh no, Harriett is in on it. *
E: O.C.
N: Everyone turns to Larry, the quietest man at the wedding, * taking his video camera out of a plastic waterproof pouch * around his neck. *
C: LARRY *
D: Harriett and Sean are lovers. Here, * look. *
E: CONT'D
N: Larry turns on his camera as Grace, Tom, Renee, Robert and * Carol huddle around to watch. * INSERT: Larry’s Video Camera Monitor * Footage from the rehearsal dinner, later in the night. * Larry films Carol dancing on her own, trying to get Renee to * join in. He PANS OVER TO the beach where Sean and Harriett * are chatting, away from the crowd, on the sand. *
C: ROBERT *
D: That’s nothing. They’re friends. * Sean has stayed with us many times-- *
E: O.C.
N: Sean kisses Harriett. *
C: ROBERT *
D: He can be affectionate, maybe he... *
E: O.C. CONT'D
N: The kissing intensifies. Harriett grabs Sean’s butt. *
C: ROBERT *
D: Huh. *
E: O.C. CONT'D
N: END VIDEO. * Robert stares off into space, stunned by the betrayal. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 97.
C: GRACE *
D: Dad, didn’t you say Harriett goes * to Bali sometimes? *
C: ROBERT *
D: For yoga retreats. She likes to go * alone to quiet her mind. *
C: GRACE *
D: Dad... *
C: ROBERT *
D: Yeah, I hear it too. *
N: Renee looks at Robert, dying to say something.
C: ROBERT
D: What? Say it. Go ahead.
E: CONT'D
C: RENEE
D: Robert. I’m sorry.
N: Robert is surprised by her grace in that moment. He nods.
S: INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
N: Sean stands by the Pirate Leader, arm still around Harriett. * But this time, she’s kissing his arm tenderly. * The Pirate Leader looks through binoculars. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: THERE! *
N: They look down and see a wrecked resort golf cart on the ocean rocks, waves SMASHING AGAINST IT. It’s the one Grace and Tom were ziptied too. But they don’t * know that. Sean processes this for a beat.
C: SEAN
D: Grace... *
C: PIRATE LEADER
D: YOU SAID THIS JOB WOULD REPAY YOUR DEBTS TEN FOLD. SO FAR ALL IT’S DONE IS KILLED FOUR GOOD MEN.
C: SEAN
D: YEAH... SORRY THAT HAPPENED. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 98.
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: SORRY!? THE DEAL IS OFF. I TAKE ALL * THE MONEY AND YOU WALK AWAY WITH * YOUR LIVES. *
C: SEAN *
D: BUT... WE HAD AN ARRANGEMENT. *
N: Harriett gently puts her arms around Sean. *
C: HARRIETT *
D: SEAN, BE REASONABLE. WE’RE LUCKY TO * BE ALIVE. *
C: PIRATE LEADER *
D: LISTEN TO YOUR WOMAN. *
N: In one swift motion, Harriett UNHOOKS the Pirate Leader from * his clip and KICKS him out of the helicopter. He plummets to * his death. She holds her gun on Clown-Face. *
C: HARRIETT *
D: TAKE US BACK AND WE’LL FINISH THE * JOB OURSELVES. *
C: SEAN *
D: Um, sweetie... *
C: HARRIETT *
D: WHAT? *
N: Harriett turns, wild-eyed. Sean is clearly afraid of her. *
C: SEAN *
D: Good plan, baby. *
N: BACK AT THE POOL: * Grace and Tom whisper to each other. *
C: GRACE *
D: What do we do now? They’ll be back * any minute. *
C: TOM *
D: I don’t know. I’m out of ideas. *
C: DOG-FACE *
D: NO WHISPERS! OR I THROW GRENADE IN * THE POOL! *
N: Tom and Grace eye the grenade hanging off his belt and glance * at each other, knowingly. They have to get the grenade. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 99.
C: TOM *
D: * Go with me. * * Hey. Since we all might die, maybe * we should just have the wedding now. Whaddya say, Grace? *
E: low, to Grace then, loudly
C: GRACE *
D: I love it! Bride’s side on the * right, groom’s on the left. *
C: TOM *
D: Marge, we need you up here to * officiate... *
N: The guests are confused and scared but they go along with it. *
C: DOG-FACE *
D: No, stop it! *
C: TIGER-FACE *
D: Let ‘em do it. Why not? *
C: DOG-FACE *
D: What?! *
C: TIGER-FACE *
D: * I love weddings. *
E: shrug
C: GRACE *
D: Dad, will you do the honors? *
N: Grace smiles at her dad. Robert takes her arm and walks down * the “aisle” towards Tom at the shallow end. Grace looks at * Marge, signaling with her eyes toward Dog-Face. She nods. * Grace looks at Tom. For a second, they get lost in this * moment. A bride walking down the aisle to her groom. Grace * lands at the “altar,” next to Tom. Holding hands. *
C: TOM
D: Jeannie, you were going to do a * reading, right? *
N: Jeannie, terrified, shakes her head. She’s too scared.
C: TOM
D: That’s okay, don’t worry--
E: CONT'D
C: CAROL *
D: AT LAST!
E: O.S. sung
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 100. Everyone turns to see Carol, singing Etta James’ “At Last” * with utter commitment. *
C: CAROL *
D: My love has come along My lonely days are over
E: CONT'D
N: Inspired by her courage, Renee joins her. *
C: CAROL AND RENEE *
D: And life is like a song *
C: GUESTS AT LAST! *
D: The skies above are blue *
N: Grace and Tom can’t believe it. Everyone is finally united. * Even Tiger-Face wipes a tear from his eye. *
C: GUESTS *
D: My heart was wrapped up in clover * The night I looked at you *
E: CONT'D
N: Grace, Tom and Marge look at each other and NOD. Together * they RUSH the two pirates: * -Tom KICKS a stunned Tiger-Face in the stomach. * -Marge pulls an impressive KRAV-MAGA-style Elbow Strike on * Dog Face, knocking him down. * -Grace yanks at Dog-Face’s belt as he scrambles for his gun. * -Tiger-Face scrambles back up and grabs his gun. * -Dog-Face gets his gun and flips around, aiming it at Grace. *
C: DOG-FACE
D: I finally get to kill you. *
N: The hostages look on, breathless. Terrified. *
C: GRACE *
D: I think you’d regret that.
N: Then Dog-Face sees Grace is holding one of his grenades. She * spits the grenade’s pin into the dirt. Smiling.
C: GRACE *
D: I’m still fairly new to grenades... but I’m pretty sure if you shoot me... this springy thing pops loose * and this thing blows us all inside out. Is that right, sweetie?
E: CONT'D
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 101.
C: TOM
D: That’s right, darling. *
N: The Pirates look like they’re regretting the choices that led * them to this moment.
C: GRACE *
D: Drop the guns.
N: Tiger-Face immediately drops his gun and puts his hands up. * Dog-Face doesn’t want to back down. Not again. Suddenly he * sprints down to the lawn below the pool. * As Ace cuffs Tiger-Face with his own zipties, a bullet flies * past Grace. Dog-Face is SHOOTING AT GRACE from the lawn. *
C: TOM *
D: Everyone, get down! *
N: The guests in the pool duck. Some go under water. Bullets * whiz through the air. * ON LARRY, shielding Scotty in the pool. A bullet flies past * Larry, grazing his arm. He yelps. * ON RENEE, cowering as BANG! Someone next to her returns fire * at Dog-Face. She turns to see: * CAROL, out of the pool, behind a lounge chair, holding * Grace’s shotgun like a badass. She fires again, shouting. *
C: CAROL *
D: No one shoots my sweet husband, you * fuck! *
N: Renee stares, stunned. Impressed. * ON GRACE and TOM, huddled behind a chair. She looks at the * grenade in her hand. *
C: GRACE *
D: I can’t throw that far. I won’t * reach him. *
N: Tom grabs a DECORATIVE STATUE nearby, wielding it like a bat. *
C: TOM *
D: Put me in coach. *
N: ON THE LAWN, Dog-Face ducks behind a TABLE for cover. Then * peeks to see: * Tom standing, curiously armed with nothing but a statue-- * Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 102. Suddenly Grace tosses a grenade straight up... * TOM SWINGS HIS TABLE LEG LIKE A BAT AND NAILS IT-- * The grenade flies straight toward Dog-Face hitting the * table... which happens to be the FIREWORKS STAND. * It EXPLODES! A GEYSER OF BLOOD ERUPTS and the FIREWORKS SHOOT * IN THE SKY in every direction. It’s SPECTACULAR. * All the guests peek to watch, momentarily mesmerized by the * fireworks. They break out into WILD APPLAUSE AND CHEERS. * Scotty’s jaw is on the floor, having just witnessed his uncle * doing the single most badass thing that’s ever happened. *
C: TOM *
D: Really glad that worked. Or else * the “Put me in coach” would’ve * really hung in the air. *
E: CONT'D
N: Grace laughs. Proud. But there’s no time to celebrate. They * see the helicopter in the distance, headed back this way. *
C: GRACE *
D: We have to get everyone somewhere * safe. *
N: Ace, guarding Tiger-Face, spots KEYS around his neck. *
C: ACE *
D: I know where to go. * * Let’s get moving! Out of the pool! *
E: to the guests
N: As the fireworks shoot overhead, the guests help each other * out of the pool, as Ace leads the way. * ANGLE ON Carol, handing Renee a towel as they go. *
C: RENEE *
D: Where did you learn to shoot like * that? *
C: CAROL *
D: My dad was a marine. If you want, * we can do a mom-in-law date at the * gun range. *
C: RENEE *
D: Fuck yeah. *
N: ANGLE ON Ricky, helping Jamie out of the pool. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 103.
C: RICKY
D: Hey. You wanna marry me?
C: JAMIE
D: No, I don’t want to fucking marry you. I’ve known you for five minutes.
C: RICKY
D: Okay. Well. Wanna have sex again?
C: JAMIE *
D: Obviously. As soon as possible. *
N: ANGLE ON Larry and Robert unintentionally side by side. *
C: ROBERT
D: We don’t have to be friends, right?
C: LARRY
D: No, I don’t think so.
N: BACK ON ACE, using the keys to unlock.. THE SPA * The guests follow Ace into a gorgeous one-room spa, full of * all the RESORT WORKERS... Eager for news. ON RENEE, taking in the spa. *
C: RENEE *
D: I don’t know why we’re here but I * do not hate this. *
C: LARRY *
D: Me neither, Renee. *
N: ON LARRY, already grabbing a terrycloth robe from a rack. *
S: INT. HELICOPTER *
N: Harriett looks through binoculars at the fireworks, the * smoldering lawn, the guests being ushered into the spa... * She screams in frustration, throwing the binoculars at Sean. *
C: SEAN *
D: I can fix it. We’ll still get the * money. *
C: HARRIETT *
D: You better. Otherwise it’s Plan B. *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 104.
C: SEAN *
D: What’s Plan B again? *
C: HARRIETT *
D: * ...kill everyone? *
E: duh
C: SEAN *
D: * Of course. I got it, sweetheart. *
E: terrified
N: Sean tries to kiss her but she pulls away, clearly annoyed. *
S: EXT. RESORT SPA *
N: Grace, Tom and Marge usher the final guests into the spa. The * sound from the approaching helicopter gets louder. *
C: GRACE *
D: What’s the fastest way to the * docks?? *
C: MARGE *
D: * Down that trail. I would go with * you but... I don’t want to. *
E: pointing
N: Tom nods and goes to close the door but Carol stops him. *
C: CAROL
D: Tom! Grace! You’re not staying!? *
C: TOM *
D: We’re going to get the next island * for help, Mom. I need you to * protect everyone. Can you do that? *
N: Carol cocks her shotgun. *
C: CAROL *
D: * You fucking bet. * * Also please be careful! I love you! *
E: dead serious then, sweetly
N: Tom pushes the door shut. Grace wraps the chain around the * handle and snaps the padlock shut again. Slips the lanyard key in Tom’s jacket pocket. Grace hikes her wedding dress up her thigh, revealing her * garter belt. She slides the cake knife in it to hold it on her thigh, like she’s fucking Rambo in a wedding dress. Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 105.
C: GRACE *
D: * Also, Carol? Thank you for the cake knife. I love this cake knife. *
E: yelling through the door
N: Tom straps Tiger-Face’s Uzi to his arm, preparing for the big * showdown. *
C: TOM
D: Just you and me.
N: The sound of the HELICOPTER LANDING is deafening. They turn * to see the helicopter has just touched down 100 yards away. * Tom and Grace lock eyes with Sean and Harriett for a second * and then break into a SPRINT down the trail to the dock. Sean * runs after them, in pursuit. *
S: EXT. TRAIL - DAY *
N: SLO-MO SEQUENCE: Etta James’ original “AT LAST” plays as... * Tom and Grace run for their lives down a trail to the docks. * Sean chases them, shooting warning shots in their direction. * Tom and Grace duck and dodge bullets. They hop over rocks and * logs. Grace trips but Tom catches her before she can fall. * Sean gains on them and finally catches up to them. He GRABS * Grace by the arm as we... * END SLO-MO / END SONG * Grace turns to look at Sean with fiery anger. *
C: GRACE *
D: I dumped you! Move ON! *
N: Grace SHOVES Sean off the trail. He TUMBLES down rocks and * falls hard. Tom keeps running, but laughs, satisfied. *
S: EXT. DOCK - MOMENTS LATER *
N: Lizard-Face sits on the dock, “guarding it,” gun on his lap, * headphones on, playing a game on his phone. He is unaware of * anything that transpired today. * Suddenly, the barrel of an Uzi is in Lizard-Face’s ... face. * He stands up, dropping everything, with his hands up. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 106.
C: LIZARD-FACE *
D: Don’t shoot! Please!
C: GRACE *
D: I don’t shoot. I ziptie, motherfucker.
C: TOM *
D: How long you been holding onto that * line? *
C: GRACE *
D: A few hours. *
N: Grace whips out a pair of zipties and ties him to the dock. * As she finishes, BANG! BANG! They spins to see Sean, banged * up and pissed, up the trail running toward them. * They duck for cover behind the Amanpulo Island Resort sign. *
C: SEAN *
D: * Gracie, this is all a big * misunderstanding! We can work this * out!! I don’t want to hurt you! *
E: shouting
N: BANG! BANG! BANG! A bullet clip the side of the sign. *
C: GRACE *
D: * Then stop shooting at us, asshole! *
E: shouting back
C: TOM
D: * And stop calling her Gracie! * * I’ll hold him off. Get the boat!
E: shouting then, to Grace
C: GRACE *
D: Which one?
N: Tom points to the one covered by a tarp. Tom SHOOTS back at * Sean, forcing Sean to duck behind a palm tree. * Grace runs and rips the tarp off, revealing-- * The gorgeous 1973 Riva Aquarama speedboat decked out in white streamers with “Just Married” spelled out in wooden letters. She freezes. Stunned. Or maybe just dazed from blood loss.
C: TOM
D: Keys are under the seat!
N: Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 107. Grace snaps out of it, saws through the anchor-rope with the * cake knife and climbs aboard.
C: GRACE *
D: Got ‘em!
N: She starts the motor, opens up the throttle and pulls away from the dock. Tom runs and jumps onto the back just in time! They speed off... dragging the “Just Married” buoys in their wake like tin cans. BACK ON THE DOCK, Sean climbs onto a resort speedboat with a huge engine and a tow-line on the back for parasailing. He starts the engine up and it ROARS to life, so fast the nose shoots up out of the water... IN THE “JUST MARRIED” BOAT, Turquoise water turns dark blue as they get into open ocean. They just have to get to the marina on the horizon! But Sean’s parasailing boat is catching up.
C: GRACE *
D: I should’ve known he was a psychopath. Who doesn’t RSVP to a wedding and then shows late up in a * fucking helicopter?
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: RIGHT???
N: As Grace guns the engine she sees the picnic basket and the * champagne bottle floating in a bucket of melted ice.
C: GRACE *
D: So. You had this all planned?
C: TOM
D: Just you and me, out in the middle * of the ocean...
N: Tom smiles at her sadly. Grace stares at him, moved. *
C: TOM
D: Hey. I wanted to say... You’re * right. I disappeared on you and--
E: CONT'D
N: BANG! BANG! BANG! Sean shoots at their boat. Tom and Grace * DUCK as he keeps talking. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 108.
C: TOM
D: I thought a perfect wedding would * mean a perfect marriage. But that’s * not real-- Look at my parents. And * my Aunt Marie, the sex addict-- but * the point is, I need you to know--
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: Hold on!
N: Grace SHARPLY TURNS THE BOAT to try and get away from Sean. * It works for a moment-- Sean is forced to change directions.
C: GRACE *
D: What were you saying?
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: I love you. And I never stopped loving you because it’s not fucking possible for me to stop loving you-- And I’m sorry I didn’t see how * scared you were and-- Do you think, if we’re both alive tomorrow, we * could just start over? *
C: GRACE *
D: No.
C: TOM
D: No? What do you mean “no”?
N: BANG. A bullet hits the boat. Sean is on their tail again. * Tom shoots, as Grace speeds up the boat. * MORE GUNFIRE FROM SEAN, then the gunfire stops.
C: TOM
D: He’s out of ammo!
E: CONT'D
N: Tom leans over the back of the boat and SPRAYS RETURN FIRE until-- CLICK CLICK. * Suddenly, Sean’s boat pulls side by side. He drives the boat with one hand, in a dripping wet tux. Still cool as hell.
C: SEAN
D: Hey. We’re both out of ammo. I * think it’s time we go back to the * resort and have a chat! *
C: TOM *
D: Button up your goddamn shirt! *
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 109. Tom grabs the champagne bottle POPS THE CORK. BLASTING IT RIGHT into Sean’s eyes! Sean shakes it off, barely phased.
C: SEAN
D: Oh no, not a cork!
E: dry
C: GRACE *
D: God, Sean, what happened to you?! * You used to want to help people! *
C: SEAN
D: Yeah, and you used to have higher * standards! Things change! *
N: Sean is hit with ICE from Tom’s ice bucket. Tom then throws * the actual ice bucket. It bounces off his head.
C: SEAN
D: This is the guy you chose over me? He threw a bucket at my head. You * want to spend your life with him? *
E: CONT'D
N: Now truly desperate, Tom opens the picnic basket and pegs * fruit at Sean’s head: strawberries, oranges, bananas. *
C: TOM
D: We’re still working through some issues! And also, fuck you!
N: Tom NAILS Sean in the head with a coconut. Sean winces and * grabs a jug of gasoline and hurls it into Tom and Grace’s * boat. It spills all over the deck. Sean aims a flare gun-- OH SHIT. Tom leaps into Sean’s boat! *
C: GRACE *
D: Tom!!!
N: Tom tries to wrestle the flare gun away from Sean. Sean knees Tom in the stomach and pistol-whips him-- Sean then whips his boat around, steering back towards the resort. He knows Grace will follow ‘cause he’s got Tom. *
C: TOM
D: NO! GRACE! NO! Forget about me! * Keep going to the marina!
N: But Grace follows. The chase is flipped! *
C: SEAN
D: Love makes us do stupid things...
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 110. Tom gets a lucky blow and knocks the flare gun out of Sean’s hands. It skitters across the deck. Sean dives for it. Sean turns to aim but sees a parasailing harness fall around * his neck like a noose. What the fuck? Tom sees a SMALL LEVER at the back of the boat and hurls an * orange at it -- causing the chute to unfurl into the wind! * Sean is yanked up into the air but grabs Tom! The parachute pops wide open behind the boat, ripping them both 50 feet into the air-- --dangling helpless as they’re pulled by the driverless, speeding boat. On a crash course with the resort island. IN THE PURSUING SPEED BOAT, Grace can’t believe her eyes: * The giant parachute is a big yellow smiley-face. Below it * Sean dangles, with Tom grabbing onto him. * Grace speeds to catch up with them... * MEANWHILE, Underneath that incongruous smiley face parachute, Tom grips * onto Sean for dear life. No harness. Scared but determined. * Tom’s eyes flick down at the water below. If Sean drops him, * he’d hit the water like concrete.
C: SEAN
D: Have you noticed that any time you try to fix things... you just make everything worse for everyone...
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: Actually... ...I have noticed that.
E: we’re waiting for a great comeback
N: Tom’s got nothing left. So hurt. So tired.
C: SEAN
D: I’d be doing Grace a favor killing * you... *
N: Tom claws on tight to Sean as he sees Grace’s boat pulling * beside Sean’s, trying to rescue him. Sean’s boat is a hundred * feet from smashing into the rocky coast of the island. Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 111. Grace bumps her boat into Sean’s, trying to push it away from * its collision course. No dice. She stands on the seat, jams * the throttle, and rips the cake knife from her dress. * She’ll need it to jump to the other boat. She leaps!! * PARASAILING BOAT --and lands in this boat. Then grabs the controls and steers them back towards the marina of the next island. She sees the flaming “Just Married” boat she ditched CAREEN ASHORE Amanpulo island... ...blasting through the rows of white chairs and crashing into rocks in an FIERY EXPLOSION.
C: GRACE *
D: Not a great omen...
N: UP IN THE PARACHUTE, Tom saw the explosion too. Then sees Grace steering them toward the mainland. He’s proud of her... * Until he turns and sees that Sean is grinning.
C: SEAN
D: There’s my girl... *
N: Tom follows his gaze and sees Sean’s helicopter flying up over the treeline. Harriett. Coming after them. Fuck! * IN THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER, Harriett hangs off the side. With wild hair, crazed eyes, and * an Uzi strapped to her: she looks scary as hell. *
C: HARRIETT *
D: * Drop him, you coward!! *
E: shouting to Sean
N: IN THE PARACHUTE, Tom takes in Harriett. *
C: TOM *
D: Your girlfriend is fucking * terrifying. *
C: SEAN *
D: * She’s a free spirit. *
E: masking fear
N: Tom looks down at Grace in the boat. Unarmed. Helpless. * Tom sees the chopper’s menacing shadow appear in the translucent parachute... Fifty feet above him... Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 112. Harriett OPENS FIRE ON GRACE’S BOAT! Her view is obstructed * by the parachute, but she hits the fuel tank, spilling oil * from the back of the boat. CLOSE ON Grace, realizing that they are finished. *
C: GRACE *
D: WE’RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT!
N: Then she smiles a little, looks up at Tom, and says, quietly:
C: GRACE *
D: I love you.
E: CONT'D
N: Tom locks eyes with Grace-- then looks at down the rope to * the boat—- then looks down at the water. He gets an idea and * reaches in his pocket to grab... Grace’s hair extensions. *
C: SEAN *
D: * Is that... loose hair? *
E: grossed out, confused
N: ON GRACE, looking up at Tom, realizing what he’s about to do. *
C: GRACE *
D: You got this!! *
N: ON TOM, putting the hair extensions over the taut cord... *
C: TOM *
D: * I got this. *
E: to himself
N: And lets go of Sean to zip-line down! * He zooms down and STICKS the landing. Like Grace’s superhero * landing before. She smiles, impressed and overwhelmed when-- * BULLETS PIERCE ALL AROUND THEM. Tom grabs a MACHETE and * slices through the rope... * ...sending Sean’s parachute hurtling high into the sky... ...right into the blades of the helicopter. We hear the BLADES CHEW THROUGH SEAN... SNAP THE ROPE and then CHOKE on the parachute... Grace dives to shield Tom as-- * THE HELICOPTER VEERS WILDLY, CRASHES INTO THE WATER, AND EXPLODES! Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 113. Tom and Grace lie on the back of the boat in each others’ * arms. They can’t believe they’re alive. The engine is kaput, but the boat bobs in the waves... floating back towards the resort island.
S: EXT. BEACH - AMANPULO ISLAND - LATER
N: The parasailing boat sits in the sand like a beached whale... near the destroyed white rented chairs and the burned wreckage of the “Just Married” boat. Splatters of oil on the sand are still burning from the explosion. Tom hobbles as Grace helps him to the beach. *
C: GRACE *
D: You really stuck that landing! *
C: TOM
D: I know! I might have broken my * ankle though. Maybe both. *
C: GRACE *
D: Still proud. *
N: They look at each other for a beat, then: *
C: TOM
D: So when you said “no” before...
C: GRACE *
D: I meant: No, I don’t want to start * over... *
C: TOM
D: Oh. Okay.
N: Tom is heartbroken for a moment, until he sees Grace pushing * her broken body into a kneeling position.
C: GRACE *
D: ...I want to keep going. *
N: Tom grins. So in love with this blood-spattered woman.
C: TOM
D: The ring’s in my pocket. I mean, if you’re going to do it, do it right.
N: With bloody hands, Tom passes Grace her engagement ring. She * holds it up to him. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 114.
C: GRACE *
D: Thomas Fowler, will you marry me? *
C: TOM *
D: Are you sure? You’re not scared? *
C: GRACE *
D: I’m fucking terrified. And I’m * absolutely sure. Life is chaotic * but nothing is easier than loving * you. And I want to love you every * day for the rest of my life. It’s * simple when you really think about * it. *
N: Tom smiles, fighting back tears. *
C: GRACE *
D: So, you want to do this or what? *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: Yes. I do.
N: Grace slides the diamond ring onto Tom’s finger. Or tries to. * It doesn’t fit. They laugh, overwhelmed and delirious. *
C: GRACE *
D: Fine, I’ll wear it. *
N: Grace smiles as Tom puts the ring on her finger. Again. A * tender, quiet moment. *
C: TOM *
D: Okay, I have to admit, there is * something nice about a private * proposal. No crowds. No pictures. *
C: GRACE *
D: See, I told you!! *
N: They kiss and turn toward the horizon just as a SCHOOL OF * WHALES crests in the ocean. They watch, astounded. *
C: GRACE *
D: Holy shit! *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM *
D: Is that fucking real? *
C: GRACE *
D: Did anyone else see that? Fuck, I * wish we had a camera! *
N: They laugh and Grace lies down with Tom. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 115.
C: TOM
D: How long do you think we can wait before we let our families out?
C: GRACE *
D: They’re good for ten more minutes.
N: Grace pushes him back onto the sand gently as they make out. * He hikes up her tattered wedding dress as MUSIC SWELLS.
S: INT. RESORT SPA - LATER *
N: The wedding guests and resort staff are all intermingling in * bathrobes. Many in face masks. Drinking cucumber water. * Ricky is giving Jamie a massage. Larry is giving Carol a * pedicure. As hostage situations go, this one isn’t bad. * Everyone hears the DOOR CREAKING OPEN and see... Tom and * Grace silhouetted at the door. *
C: GRACE *
D: Hey everybody...
N: Everyone cheers and rushes them.
S: EXT. AMANPULO RESORT - SUNSET
N: Everyone sits on the sand together. Tom and Grace have that * blissed out energy of two people who had spontaneous sex right before hosting a dinner party. They’re calm and smiling and holding hands as they fill everyone in on what happened.
C: GRACE *
D: ...and then the helicopter exploded. *
C: CAROL
D: You seem so relaxed... *
C: GRACE *
D: * Do we? *
E: smirking at Tom
C: ROBERT
D: * Look like the coast guard’s on the * way. They must have seen the smoke.
E: noticing
C: TOM
D: In the meantime... I really don’t * want to plan another wedding.
N: Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 116. Tom and Grace look over at Marge. She smiles. *
C: MARGE
D: Let’s do this thing.
C: TOM *
D: I don’t know where our rings are...
C: GRACE *
D: I already thought of that. Scotty, can you help us out? *
N: Her soon-to-be nephew Scotty looks up, ready to help. *
S: EXT. BEACH - LATER
N: As the last sliver of sun sits on the horizon and coast guard boats descend on the island... Grace and Tom stand under the threshold decorated with wilted * flowers. Their clothes are ripped and stained with blood . She’s still wearing combat boots. They make quite the pair. Some guests sit in the white rental chairs. Some sit on the front of the beached parasailing boat. Some in the sand. Marge officiates but we just hear MUSIC. The Coast Guard land on the beach. They approach but Jamie * turns and holds a finger up. So the Coast Guard Guys watch the makeshift wedding ceremony, confounded. Scotty brings something over to Tom and Grace. He opens his * palms to reveal: two grenade pins with metal rings.
C: TOM *
D: They’re perfect.
N: They slide them on each other’s fingers and kiss. The guests clap and so do the confused Coast Guard guys. Then BANG!! Everyone jolts, scared, but then see-- It’s just * Ricky lighting off one final firework. *
C: RICKY
D: Sorry. I saw there was one last * firework and I thought it would be * fun but it absolutely was not. One * hundred percent my bad.
N: Carol and Larry carry over what’s left of the wedding cake. Tom and Grace take a moment to stand back and watch everyone: * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 117. Ricky and Jamie flirt over handfuls of cake. Grace’s parents * have a heart to heart with their bare feet in the sand. Ace and Marge hold each other, watching the sunset.
C: GRACE *
D: I finally get it.
C: TOM
D: Get what?
C: GRACE *
D: Why you wanted a wedding.
N: Tom smiles. It means a lot to hear her say that.
C: GRACE *
D: It’s perfect. I wouldn’t change a thing.
E: CONT'D
N: That hangs in the air for a second before--
C: GRACE *
D: Well obviously--
E: CONT'D
C: TOM GRACE
D: Yeah no I know. I would change a lot. The people dying and-- *
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: I know what you mean.
E: CONT'D
C: GRACE *
D: You get me.
C: TOM
D: Yeah... I get you.
N: Grace hugs him. Husband and wife. Til death do they part. *
T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: THE END * OVER CREDITS * From the POV of Larry’s Video Camera: We see moments from * later in the night after a few (at lot) of drinks. * -Ricky gives his speech, Jamie cracks up at every joke. * Clearly falling in love. * -Tom and Darcy have their first dance. It’s a little clunky * since Tom’s ankle is likely broken. They laugh through it. * Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 118. -The HOUSE BAND -- with ACE as the lead singer -- plays an * American pop song in Filipino. Ace is very good. Tom smiles * at Marge, grateful. * -Carol jumps on stage with the band and sings. The crowd goes * WILD. Renee dances in the front like a groupie. * -Jeannie drunkenly makes out with a caterer. * -The MOMS-IN-LAW convince the DADS-IN-LAW to all jump in the * pool. They do and immediately regret it since it’s freezing. * -The whole wedding party does KARAOKE, all singing parts of * the same song. Even Larry puts the camera down and jumps in. *
