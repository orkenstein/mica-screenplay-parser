N:   Getting an idea, he jumps into the flower bed, grabs the

D:             stay here while I get back on my
D:             feet, and I’m really glad you’re in
D:             my life. So... can we just take a

D:             So, turns out I might be bad at
D:             dating. But I thought: instead of
D:             playing any games, I could just
D:             kind of lay out who I am -- and be
D:             honest about the fact that I’m
D:             still kind of figuring that out.

D:             Well, here’s what you need to know
D:             about me: I’ve spent a lot of time
D:             being a freight train, zooming
D:             toward my goals -- owning a
D:             business, making money, becoming
D:             best friends with Beyonce and
D:             saying, “Leave him, girl!”, you
D:             don’t need the whole list. And I’m
D:             never going to stop heading towards
D:             what I want. But it’s possible it’s
D:             time to stop being a freight train,
D:             and try being a -- what do you call
D:             it? -- a people train. I’m ready to
D:             try let someone in and have them on
D:             the journey with me.

N:   We POP WIDE to reveal: Derek and Chloe are at the same bar,
N:   but are seated at TWO DIFFERENT TABLES, ON DIFFERENT DATES!

N:   Derek is on a date with MARIA, the woman from the jewelry
N:   shop in Act One. Derek is smiling at her.
0: 
C:                        MARIA
D:             I didn’t think I’d see you again.
D:             But it’s nice that you’re looking
D:             for your true self. That’s
D:             beautiful.

D:             I’m a searcher, too... But then I
D:             found a group of people who helped
D:             me find me. Have I talked to you
D:             about Father Bryan?

D:             ...No. Wanna keep not telling me?

C:                       MARIA
D:             It’s not a religious cult. It’s
D:             just called “The Rylygyn” -- like
D:             religion, but with all Ys?

N:   A WAITRESS delivers drinks. Smiling politely, Derek downs his
N:   entire drink in one long series of gulps as Maria continues:

C:                       MARK
D:             I didn’t think I’d ever see you

D:             broke up with me.
0: 
C:                       CHLOE
D:             Well, Mark, it’s possible I didn’t
D:             break up with you because of you,
D:             but because of me.
0: 
N:   They smile. The chemistry is real.

C:                       MARK
D:             This is an interesting development.
D:             Because my friends were like,
D:             “There’s got to be some reason it
D:             didn’t work”, but I didn’t care.
D:             Because you leaving was literally
D:             the saddest thing in the world. I
D:             was literally dead for a week.
