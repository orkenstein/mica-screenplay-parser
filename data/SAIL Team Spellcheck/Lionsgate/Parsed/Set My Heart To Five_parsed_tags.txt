D:              Inspector Bridges will appear for
D:              our finale. But I have called his

D:              window table in a celebrated burger

D:              But whether he turns up or not, I
D:              have surely felt my last feeling.
D:              Neither you nor I believe in
D:              anything so unscientific as an
D:              afterlife. But we do both believe
D:              in the power of the moving image.
D:              So if you think of me, please
D:              remember me driving a 1967 racing
D:              green Porsche through Big Sur at
D:              magic hour with Amber beside me. It
D:              will help you to feel nostalgic,
D:              not sad. And if you do ever manage
D:              to tell my story, then maybe then
D:              the people watching it won’t leave
D:              the theater feeling sympathy for a
D:              bot who malfunctioned so badly he
D:              jumped from a bridge. Maybe they
D:              will leave it feeling something far
D:              more precious: empathy. Sweet
D:              empathy for somebody who, at the
D:              end of it all, was not so very
D:              unlike them. Set it to five
D:              forever, Jared.
