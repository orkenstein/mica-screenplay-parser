M: I'm in one.
S: INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL - SUITE — FEB 2014
N: The screen explodes with the flickering lights of BIRTHDAY CANDLES on a CAKE. CLOSE ON: MIKE, 40, with a sweet, open face. He makes a wish and then, with determination, takes a deep breath...
S: INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL - SUITE — LATER
N: A dozen and a half BIRTHDAY PARTY GUESTS are gathered in a large and swanky suite cheering Mike as the candles go out. Mike looks up at KIT, 42, tall and handsome, with a contagious and mischievous smile.
S: INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL — SUITE — LATER
N: A KNIFE slices through the large sheet cake decorated with a fondant PAPA SMURF and “HAPPY 40th MIKE!”
C: MIKE
D: No one’s getting a slice of Papa Smurf. I will be cutting around Papa, not through him.
C: KIT
D: Mike, he takes up half the cake.
N: Mike hands a piece of cake to NICK, 40s, who waves it off.
C: NICK
D: I just came for slots.
C: MIKE
D: Says the biggest slot I know.
C: NICK
D: Slot-shaming is never okay.
S: INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL — SUITE — LATER
N: Mike struggles to open a bottle of CHAMPAGNE, as Kit talks to NINA, 41, Nick and RILEY, 22, Nick's attractive young twink boyfriend. Kit takes the bottle from Mike and opens it.
S: INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL — SUITE — LATER
N: Nick and Riley are with Mike, who’s sipping a glass of WINE. Nick hands him a beautifully wrapped GIFT.
C: MIKE
D: I said no gifts unless they're super expensive and come with a gift receipt.
E: dryly
C: NICK
D: Shut up and open it.
N: Mike rips the wrapper open to reveal a VINTAGE TV GUIDE with DOM DELUISE smiling on the cover.
C: NICK
D: It’s from the week you were born, Mr. TVLine.
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: Holy hell. Dom DeLuise in “Lotsa Luck.” Ran only one season.
C: NICK
D: The shit you know.
C: RILEY
D: Wait, is that you?
E: O.C.
N: Riley's been looking at a PHOTO of Mike, one of many displayed on a nearby table. It’s YOUNG MIKE, 12, when he was OBESE.
C: MIKE
D: That was me.
C: NICK
D: You look like a young Dom DeLuise.
C: MIKE
D: I'll take that as a compliment.
S: INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL — SUITE — LATER
N: Mike getting everyone’s attention, holding up a wine glass...
C: MIKE
D: Attention please! Thank you all for coming to the edge of the earth to celebrate with me. You’ll be happy to hear, Nick, that it’s time to go play sluts. And because my generosity knows no bounds, I’m spotting everyone their first five bucks.
C: NINA
D: We don't deserve you.
N: As Mike starts handing out five dollar bills, he looks around the room for Kit, who’s nowhere to be seen.
S: INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL — SUITE - BATHROOM — LATER
N: Kit, looking tired, sits on the edge of the tub, as Mike comes in.
C: MIKE
D: There you are. We’re going down to the casino. You all right?
E: taking him in
C: KIT
D: I'm fine.
C: MIKE
D: You sure?
C: KIT
D: I'm fine. You enjoying your party?
C: MIKE
D: I am. Thank you for... this.
S: INT. THE REVEL CASINO HOTEL — CASINO — LATER
N: Mike plays SLOTS next to Nick and Riley as Kit and Nina walk up. Nick immediately notices ten gaudy SPIDER RINGS on each of Kit's fingers.
C: NICK
D: Where’d you get those?
C: KIT
D: I won them in the arcade. You like?
C: MIKE
D: They’re very you.
E: looking up for a second
C: KIT
D: I’m saving them for Halloween. I’m going as Sharon Needles from Drag Race.
N: Mike turns his attention back to the slot machine...
C: MIKE
D: Come on, Universe. I need a win.
E: to himself
N: Mike pushes the spin button and the screen starts to twirl, Kit comes closer to him.
C: KIT
D: I’m gonna run upstairs to go to the bathroom.
N: Mike watches him walk away, looking concerned. He's thinking about following him when he suddenly hears DING, DING, DING. His slot machine is erupting with noise. THREE DOUBLE DIAMONDS have lined up in a row. The simulated sound of coins crashing into the payout tray fills the air... CONFETTI starts falling from the ceiling now, then balloons.
C: MIKE
D: That really happened. Me winning, at least. Not the balloons and the confetti. That was me. I watch too much TV.
E: V.O.
N: Mike proudly turns back to see if Kit caught this before he went upstairs. He didn't. He's gone. A heaviness once again begins to permeate Mike's face.
C: MIKE
D: I tried so hard to put on a happy face that night. Now hold that cryptic thought while we segue to what we in the TV biz call an "extended flashback sequence" because, um, origin story. Duh.
E: V.O. beat
N: The ding, ding, ding of the slot machine gets louder and louder, turning into a THUMP, THUMP, THUMP... CHYRON: PREVIOUSLY ON
S: INT. CLUB - NIGHT - NOV 2001
N: A New York City nightclub, packed with GAY MEN in various athletic gear. Mike, 27 now, stands awkwardly on the edge of the dance floor with Nick, 30, who's in baseball pants and a tank-top, and ADAM, 22, in just a tight wrestling singlet, an earlier twink boyfriend. Mike's only nod to sports is his Yankee cap.
C: MIKE
D: I don't belong here.
C: NICK
D: It's the Athletes Ball. You jog.
C: MIKE
D: I run. I don't jog.
N: Two HOT GUYS with perfect abs, wearing nothing but football pants and black stripes under their eyes, push past them. They shout over the music...
C: MIKE
D: I’m going to go do some crunches. Be back in six months.
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: If you leave, Mike, Osama Bin Laden wins.
N: Mike looks around at the throng, as if on cue, a SWIRLING SPOTLIGHT hits Kit, 29 now, looking younger and more handsome than ever. He’s standing with Nina, 28, just like he was at Atlantic City. She’s one of the few women there. Mike can’t help but stare at him, he’s so striking. Suddenly Kit turns away from Nina and his eyes land on Mike’s. Mike freaks and quickly turns away. Nick saw everything and smiles.
C: NICK
D: You're welcome. Hey, Adam, baby, go get us some drinks--two vodka sodas and...?
E: CONT'D beat
C: MIKE
D: Diet Coke for me. Is he old enough to buy drinks?
E: off Adam heading off
C: NICK
D: He’s twenty-two! And an actor!
C: MIKE
D: I knew he looked familiar-- I’ve seen his work on Nickelodeon.
N: Mike's trying not to, but he can’t help sneak another look at Kit, who catches him and their eyes meet. Kit smiles. Mike quickly spins around to find Nick looking at him.
C: NICK
D: He's totally into you.
C: MIKE
D: No, he's not.
C: NICK
D: He is. He's checking you out. Right now. Turn around.
E: looking over at Kit
C: MIKE
D: No. I can’t.
N: Nick takes Mike by the shoulders and gently, but firmly turns him around.
C: MIKE
D: It was like looking into the sun. If the sun was tall, with a slim build, an aquiline nose and wearing the perfect pair of nerdy-but-sexy glasses.
E: V.O.
C: NICK
D: Ask him to dance!
N: Mike turns around to look at Nick again...
C: MIKE
D: He’s with a woman!
C: NICK
D: Don’t be ridiculous. No man in this room has been “with a woman” for years. If ever.
N: Kit begins to walk over as Mike starts to panic.
C: MIKE
D: He's coming over.
C: NICK
D: I'm going to go see what's taking Adam so long.
C: MIKE
D: Please don't leave me.
N: Nick ignores him, walking away as Kit arrives.
C: KIT MIKE
D: Hey! Hey!
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: Buy you a drink?
C: MIKE
D: A child actor is fetching me one. But thank you.
C: KIT
D: It’s Kit!
C: MIKE
D: Kit? Really? I'm Mike! That's crazy! Mike and Kit! Knight Rider!
N: Kit is slow to make the connection.
C: MIKE
D: It was a TV show in the Eighties.
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: Do you want to dance?
C: MIKE
D: I'm not much of a dancer...
C: KIT
D: Come on.
E: interrupts
N: Off Mike, nervously smiling...
S: INT. CLUB - NIGHT - LATER
N: Mike awkwardly dances with Kit in a crowd of shirtless MEN. Kit’s shirtless too, a red cocktail STRAW between his teeth. He’s adorable, like a flirty farm boy with a piece of hay in the corner of his mouth. Kit leans in to kiss him, but Mike playfully blocks him by plucking the straw out of Kit’s mouth and putting it in his own. Kit takes the bait, leans in closer and pulls the straw back with his teeth, very nearly kissing Mike in the process. Kit takes the straw and flicks it into the crowd. Mike can’t help but smile, and it’s then and there that Kit pulls him in close and they have their first kiss. As they make out, the room starts to spin, the crowd disappears, leaving them alone on the dance floor. When they break out of the kiss they’re suddenly surrounded by the crowd again as confetti and balloons fall from the ceiling, Kit looks up.
C: KIT
D: Is this really happening?
C: MIKE
D: This time it really was.
E: V.O.
N: Mike looks up, feeling a little, well, overwhelmed.
S: INT. GREENWICH VILLAGE RESTAURANT - NIGHT - NOV 2001
N: Mike, dressed for a date, sits across from Kit.
C: MIKE
D: Less than fifteen minutes into our first date, I found out the tall drink of water sitting across from me, by the name of Kit Cowan, watched zero television.
E: V.O.
C: MIKE
D: No TV at all?
C: KIT
D: Is that a problem?
C: MIKE
D: No. No, of course not.
C: MIKE
D: It was a huge problem.
E: V.O.
C: KIT
D: Favorite show?
C: MIKE
D: At the moment? Felicity.
C: KIT
D: Is that the one that got cancelled because the star cut her hair?
C: MIKE
D: It did not get cancelled. But yes, there was an uproar over her haircut.
E: eye roll
C: KIT
D: See, I know stuff!
N: The WAITER arrives with their drinks...
C: WAITER
D: A Stella, and a Diet Coke for you.
C: KIT
D: So, don’t drink or can’t?
C: MIKE
D: Am I an alcoholic? No. I just never liked the taste. What about you: drunkard or junkie?
C: KIT
D: Photographer slash art director.
C: MIKE
D: Both then. Hm.
C: KIT
D: What do you do?
C: MIKE
D: I’m a journalist. I write about television.
C: KIT
D: Ah... that makes sense. For a newspaper?
C: MIKE
D: Magazine. TV Guide.
N: Kit is impressed.
C: MIKE
D: I'm actually flying to LA tomorrow to visit the Felicity set.
E: CONT'D
N: Kit is even more impressed.
C: MIKE
D: What do you photograph about? Fashion stuff?
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: Sometimes.
C: MIKE
D: Is it rough being around underwear models?
C: KIT
D: You get used to it.
N: There’s a slightly awkward pause.
C: KIT
D: There is one show I like: Ab Fab. I have the entire series on DVD.
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: Figures. The one show I’ve never seen is the only show you’ve ever watched.
C: KIT
D: You’ve never seen AbFab? And you call yourself a--
C: MIKE
D: I’m a bad gay, I know.
C: KIT
D: I was going to say a bad television journalist.
N: Mike's enjoying the ribbing.
C: MIKE
D: How about a speed round?
C: KIT
D: A speed round?
C: MIKE
D: Middle child. Two brothers.
C: KIT
D: Only child.
E: catching on
C: MIKE
D: Suburban New Jersey.
C: KIT
D: Rural Pennsylvania.
C: MIKE
D: Mama’s boy.
C: KIT
D: Lost boy.
C: MIKE
D: Catholic.
C: KIT
D: Nothing.
C: MIKE
D: Lucky you!
C: KIT
D: Childhood obsession: Magic.
C: MIKE
D: Daytime soaps. And... other stuff. Worst Christmas memory: Finding a train set under the tree.
C: KIT
D: Not finding a magic set under mine.
C: MIKE
D: Why not?
C: KIT
D: My mom's pretty no-nonsense and she thought magic was all nonsense. Adult obsession: mid-century furniture.
C: MIKE
D: Small-town gift shops, preferably ones untouched by time.
C: KIT
D: You would've loved the five-and- dime in my hometown. It's not there anymore, sadly.
C: MIKE
D: That's my retirement plan, running a little gift store on Main Street, USA.
N: They smile. There’s another pause, but this one isn’t awkward. Kit holds Mike’s glance.
C: KIT
D: So what are your parents like?
C: MIKE
D: My mom died when I was a teenager.
C: KIT
D: Oh--
C: MIKE
D: It gets worse. My dad died a few years later.
N: Kit takes him in...
C: KIT
D: I'm sorry. Want to come over and watch a little AbFab after dinner?
E: beat
N: Off Mike, surprised by that...
C: MIKE
D: Do I look like the type of guy who goes back to someone's apartment on the first date?
N: Kit just smiles as we SMASH CUT...
S: INT. KIT'S STUDIO APT
N: Kit’s apartment is neat and stylish. Mike scans the room for clues. There are KITSCHY KNICKKNACKS on the windowsill, a wall covered with Kit’s PHOTOS, and a large drafting table with half-finished works of art. Kit suddenly pulls Mike in for a kiss. He begins to steer him toward the bed, pulling Mike’s shirt up.
C: MIKE
D: Can I use the bathroom? I have to pee.
E: tucking shirt back in
S: INT. KIT STUDIO APT - BATHROOM – MOMENTS LATER
N: Mike looks at himself in the mirror, lifts his shirt up, staring at his stretch marks, a reminder of when he was a fat and lonely kid. Suddenly looking very distressed, he pulls his shirt down, and tucks it in. He decides to open the medicine cabinet and finds a single toothbrush -- a good sign -- and a small ceramic figurine of two DINOSAURS FUCKING. Mike closes the medicine cabinet, then spots what looks like a measuring stick on top of the toilet tank. When he picks it up it becomes clear it’s actually a “PETER METER” with measurements reading “Should Have Been A Girl,” “Water Spout,” “For Big Girls And Small Cattle." Mike looks more than a little rattled, as he carefully sets it down... then washes his hands.
S: INT. KIT'S STUDIO APT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Mike comes out of the bathroom...
C: MIKE
D: Is it okay if we just watch TV?
C: KIT
D: Of course. AbFab's OK?
E: grabs a DVD off the shelf
C: MIKE
D: Better late than never.
N: As Kit pops in the disc.
S: INT. KIT STUDIO APT — LATER
N: The episode's just ending and Kit turns off the TV. They're next to each other in the bed. Mike's still looking nervous.
C: KIT
D: I think that was the gayest thing I’ve ever done on a first date.
C: MIKE
D: I doubt that.
N: Kit leans in and kisses Mike...
C: MIKE
D: How about a gay speed round?
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: So we’re going to do every gay thing but the actual gay thing?
C: MIKE
D: Realized at twelve.
C: KIT
D: Fourteen. Late bloomer.
C: MIKE
D: Obvious and bullied.
C: KIT
D: I passed.
C: MIKE
D: Came out in college.
C: KIT
D: Same. Mostly. Sort of.
C: MIKE
D: You mostly, sort of, came out in college?
C: KIT
D: I came out to everyone but my parents.
C: MIKE
D: When did you tell them? Oh my god! How do your parents not know? You’re a photographer. You're into Ab-Fab. Can’t they do the math?
E: off his busted look
C: KIT
D: They’re bad at math.
C: MIKE
D: It’s barely addition.
C: KIT
D: So when did you tell your mom, Harvey Milk?
C: MIKE
D: I didn't have to. We were both watching "Days of Our Lives" and she caught me drooling over a shirtless Bo Brady.
C: KIT
D: Busted.
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, it's awkward to realize you're gay at the exact same moment your mother realizes you're realizing you're gay.
N: Kit laughs, then really takes Mike in, before deciding to come clean...
C: MIKE
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: I’m not a fashion photographer. I take pictures of sandwiches and make store signage for Cosi... the sandwich chain.
E: sheepish
C: MIKE
D: I love Cosi! I eat there all the time. Their bread is delicious.
N: Kit smiles, leans in gently and kisses him. They begin to make out. It gets heated fast. Kit pulls his t-shirt off. Mike gets a good look at his abs as Kit starts to pull Mike’s shirt up. Mike quickly pulls away...
C: MIKE
D: I have to go.
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: Stay.
C: MIKE
D: I told you, I'm going to LA in the morning. I have to pack.
C: KIT
D: How long will you be gone?
C: MIKE
D: Just overnight.
C: KIT
D: Am I going to see you again?
C: MIKE
D: Absolutely...
C: MIKE
D: And I kept my word.
E: V.O.
S: INT. KIT STUDIO APT - NIGHT - NOV 2001
N: CLOSE ON: AbFab on TV, as we pull back to reveal a fully clothed Mike edging away from a shirtless Kit.
C: KIT
D: It's nice to have you back on the East Coast, Mr. Hollywood.
C: MIKE
D: It was my first time on a soundstage. And it was Felicity!
C: KIT
D: You have great legs.
E: barely listening
N: Kit runs his hands over Mike’s legs. Mike tenses up...
C: MIKE
D: I run.
C: KIT
D: It shows.
N: Kit tries to lift Mike’s shirt and Mike blocks him.
C: MIKE
D: I’m sorry.
C: KIT
D: Look, if you’re not into me...
C: MIKE
D: I am. I’m just... a little insecure about my tummy.
N: Kit gets up and turns off the overhead light and the lamp on the drafting/work table. He picks up the remote, mutes the TV, and turns the TV around to face the wall. The soft glow from the ever-changing images on the TV bounce off the walls and around the room — it’s a simple but magical effect. Kit lies back down next to Mike.
C: KIT
D: Better?
C: MIKE
D: Photographer my ass. You're an artist.
C: KIT
D: You don’t have to take your shirt off. Leaving something on is hot.
N: Mike crawls on top of him. They lock eyes. Kit slowly runs his hands over Mike’s chest, then gently down to his tummy. A twinge of panic seeps into Mike's expression.
C: MIKE
D: I was a fat kid...
C: KIT
D: This okay? I like a little tummy. I like your tummy. I like you.
E: interrupts off Mike’s nod
N: They kiss--Kit shirtless, Mike still wearing his shirt--and it’s perfect.
S: INT. TRIBECA ART GALLERY - NIGHT - DEC 2001
N: Mike walks in and scans the room.
C: MIKE
D: Kit's life was a tad more high-brow than mine. He was premium cable to my broadcast network.
E: V.O.
N: It’s crowded with ARTY NEW YORKERS. Mike looks intimidated. He's inching back toward the door, when Kit spots him and waves him over. Mike works his way through the crowd and joins Kit, who's standing with Nina. They hug, air kiss...
C: NINA
D: So you must be Mike.
C: MIKE
D: I didn’t know I was in “must be” territory already.
C: KIT
D: You are. And you already met him, you lush.
E: to Nina
C: NINA
D: I was really drunk that night.
C: KIT
D: Speaking of which. Who wants a drink?
C: NINA MIKE
D: Diet Coke. I'm good.
E: off her wine
N: As Kit takes off...
C: NINA
D: So what’s your life story? Tell me everything.
C: MIKE
D: Homosexual.
C: NINA
D: Fascinating.
C: MIKE
D: You?
C: NINA
D: German.
C: MIKE
D: Impressive. What side of the wall were you on?
C: NINA
D: The fun side.
C: MIKE
D: May I see your papers?
C: NINA
D: Are you INTERPOL?
C: MIKE
D: Yes, I'm into pole. I told you I'm homosexual.
N: Nina tries mightily to keep a straight face and continue their deadpan repartee but she bursts out laughing, which tickles Mike to no end. Just then, Mike spots Kit by the bar, talking to a HANDSOME MAN, clearly flirting.
S: INT. TRIBECA ART GALLERY - LATER
N: As Mike scrutinizes one of the pieces, Nina and Kit are on either side of him scrutinizing Mike...
C: KIT
D: So?
C: MIKE
D: It echoes some of his earlier work. He’s experimenting with brighter colors? It’s good.
E: vamping
C: KIT
D: It’s baaaad. Should be hung in a lobby or flung in a landfill...
C: MIKE
D: I don't know what the fuck I'm looking at...
E: interrupts, relieved
C: NINA
D: Show your own work sometime, chicken shit.
C: KIT
D: This is literally making me nauseous.
C: NINA
D: Have you seen his photography... ?
E: to Mike
C: KIT
D: Bup-bup-bup-bup... that's enough out of you.
E: interrupts
N: Off Mike's curious expression, we...
S: INT. TRIBECA ART GALLERY — OFFICES — MOMENTS LATER
N: Kit leads Mike through the offices...
C: MIKE
D: Are we even allowed to be in here?
C: KIT
D: Not really.
C: MIKE
D: Who were you talking to at the bar?
C: KIT
D: Just a friend.
N: Kit opens a window and then steps out and onto the roof of the adjoining building.
C: MIKE
D: What are you doing?
C: KIT
D: Are you coming or not?
C: MIKE
D: What if someone closes the window?
C: KIT
D: Then we’ll die out here.
N: Kit holds out his hand, Mike takes a moment, then takes it.
S: EXT. ROOFTOP — MOMENTS LATER
N: Kit leads him out and onto the roof and Mike can see why: it’s the most beautiful view of Manhattan. They’re looking up toward the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building.
C: MIKE
D: Oh... wow.
N: Kit pulls his camera out and takes a photo.
C: KIT
D: Don’t move.
E: turning to Mike
N: Kit snaps a few pics of Mike, then looks back at the city. Mike stares at Kit, really taking him in. Kit smiles and screams at the top of his lungs...
C: KIT
D: I love you, New York! I want to spend the rest of my life in you!
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: Still? Even now?
C: KIT
D: Yeah, especially now.
C: MIKE
D: Me too.
C: KIT
D: You have to yell it. So New York can hear you.
C: MIKE
D: I love you, New York! Even though I live in New Jersey! And I might have to move to LA for work someday! Maybe. But not now.
E: shouting off Kit's look
N: Despite how that sounded, Kit wraps his arms around Mike.
C: KIT
D: We should go to your place tonight.
C: MIKE
D: No.
C: KIT
D: Come on...
C: MIKE
D: The last bus is in, like, a half an hour...
E: looking at watch
C: KIT
D: We can make that. Easy. I want to see your place. Come on, it'll be fun...
C: MIKE
D: Clearly you have never been to Port Authority on a Friday night. What are you gonna brush your teeth with?
E: clocks Kit's resoluteness on the matter
C: KIT
D: My finger.
E: beat, studying Mike MORE
C: KIT
D: Unless there's some reason you don't want me to see your place...
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: Don't be ridiculous... Why wouldn't I want you to see my place?
E: defensive laughs, awkwardly
S: INT. MIKE’S NEW JERSEY APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM — LATER
N: Kit’s slack-jawed, in the middle of the room taking in the enormous collection of SMURF figurines and memorabilia. He looks like he could pass out. There is a long moment of stunned silence. Mike’s starting to grasp how crazy all this really looks, especially to someone like Kit. As Kit reaches for a figurine...
C: MIKE
D: That’s Brainy. He’s the smart one...
N: Mike notices the color in Kit’s face begin to drain. Kit places the figurine down and is unsure of what his next move should be. He enters the bedroom.
C: MIKE
D: You don’t want to go in there...
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: Oh my God, they’re in here, too!
E: O.S.
N: Mike mimes “Fuck" before following him into the bedroom.
S: INT. MIKE’S BEDROOM — CONTINUOUS
N: Mike enters and we see that this is where the bulk of the Smurf collection is. There's no curation. It looks like a bomb went off at a flea market. Kit takes a seat on the bed.
C: KIT
D: I need a minute.
C: MIKE
D: Take all the time you need...
C: KIT
D: Alone.
E: interrupts, stern
C: MIKE
D: Yep.
N: Mike exits the bedroom and closes the door behind him. As he waits nervously on the other side of the door, he glances toward the bathroom nearby and clocks his vintage Smurf shower curtain and bath rug. He shakes his head before quickly closing the door shut. Mike returns to the closed bedroom door and places his ear against it; he hears nothing. And the silence is killing him.
C: MIKE
D: I started collecting them when I was 10. I outgrew them by high school, but then after my mom died I picked it up again as a way to feel close to her. I started going to flea markets and toy shows and then eBay became a thing and it sorta... maybe... got a little out of control. I swear I’m not a pedophile.
E: CONT'D rambling beat
N: Suddenly, the door opens. Kit looks unwell.
C: KIT
D: I'm sorry. I can't do this.
N: Kit abruptly exits the apartment, leaving Mike in a state of utter shock.
S: INT. MIKE'S NEW JERSEY APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM — LATER
N: Mike is sitting on his couch watching an episode of Felicity while crying. Slowly the camera pulls back and we see that Keri Russell is sitting on the couch next to him, loosely in character as Felicity. She digs a spoon into a large container of ice cream and then hands the tub to Michael, who digs into it with his own spoon. A sudden knock at the door startles Mike — who is now alone on the couch. He springs up, dries his eyes with the sleeves of his shirt and opens the door. Kit is standing there.
C: KIT
D: Did you know the greasy spoon up the street gives you free pancakes with any omelette?
N: Kit walks into the apartment past a bewildered Mike and heads back into the bedroom. Mike follows him, tentatively.
C: KIT
D: I fooled around with another guy.
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: At the Bloomfield Diner... ?
E: jolted
C: KIT
D: It happened in the steam room of my gym last week. There wasn’t any actual sex, but there was touching. I know we never had the “exclusive” conversation, but I still feel like shit for not immediately saying something about it...
C: MIKE
D: You... cheated on me.
C: KIT
D: OK, that’s a bit extreme.
C: MIKE
D: Why are you telling me this now?
C: KIT
D: We’re coming clean about secrets, so...
C: MIKE
D: I own a few Smurfs. You cheated.
C: KIT
D: A few Smurfs?!
N: Kit clocks the fear now present in Mike’s eyes.
C: KIT
D: It was just a hand job... This is... new for me.
E: CONT'D beat
C: MIKE
D: What is?
C: KIT
D: This. You. Us. It’s different. I’ve never not wanted to fuck something up this much before.
E: beat
N: Mike can see the remorse in Kit’s face. He takes a deep breath as he carefully considers his next words.
C: MIKE
D: I’m not an open relationship kind of guy, so if that’s what you’re looking for...
C: KIT
D: I didn’t say that...
C: MIKE
D: I’m also not as... experienced as you.
C: KIT
D: I’m not that experienced...
C: MIKE
D: Let me finish.
E: interrupts
C: KIT
D: Yep.
C: MIKE
D: The first time I saw you, the way you carried yourself. The way you looked. Your confidence. Your inhibition. It scared me. Don’t get me wrong, it turned me on, too. But I instinctively thought, “This is the kinda guy that could have anyone he wants.” I also thought this is the kinda guy who has no trouble taking his shirt off at the beach... “
E: beat beat
N: Kit begins to piece together why the steam room encounter was so triggering for Mike.
C: MIKE
D: I’m not like that.
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: And I’m OK with that. Really.
E: extended beat; Kit grabs Mike’s hand
N: Mike takes in Kit's calm reassurance.
C: MIKE
D: So, for the record, you storming out was not about the Smurfs?
C: KIT
D: Oh, no. It was absolutely about the Smurfs. Mike... ...this is fucking lunacy.
E: looks around
N: Mike laughs awkwardly, still unsure of how serious a problem the Smurfs are for Kit.
C: KIT
D: Not joking...
E: CONT'D dead serious
C: MIKE
D: Got it.
E: interrupts, nodding
S: INT. MIKE’S BEDROOM — THE NEXT MORNING
N: Mike awakens and immediately reaches for Kit, only to discover he is not there.
C: MIKE
D: Kit?
E: calls out
N: Mike hops out of bed and makes a loop around the apartment; Kit is gone. Slightly alarmed, he goes to pick up his phone to check his voicemail when he notices a folded up piece of paper under a Smurf magnet on the fridge. It reads, “Peaks, Valleys and Unexpected Turbulence.” He opens it.
C: KIT
D: As I watched you sleep this morning in a totally not-stalker-ish-way... I asked myself where are you going? Wondered if our tickets are for the same destination. On the same flight. Perhaps though, our journey is the destination. If I’m scared, I’ll know you’re in the seat next to me. Holding my hand. Telling me we’re going to be OK...
E: V.O.
S: INT. KIT STUDIO APT - NIGHT - DEC 2001
N: Mike watches as Kit opens his Christmas present.
C: KIT
D: Oh, my god, a magic set! How old is this thing?
C: MIKE
D: 1960s. Not exactly your childhood, but...
C: KIT
D: Where did you... ?
C: MIKE
D: Ebay is my friend.
E: interrupts
C: KIT
D: Of course it is.
N: Kit carefully lays the Sneaky Pete Magic Set on the bed, grabs his camera, stands directly over it and takes an aerial shot of his gift, then looks up at Mike and smiles.
C: KIT
D: I love it. Thank you. I got you something, too.
E: CONT'D beat
C: MIKE
D: Actually, can we talk? Look, if you want to see other people--
E: then
C: KIT
D: I don’t.
C: MIKE
D: Well, you did.
C: KIT
D: It won’t happen again. I don’t want anyone else.
E: then
C: MIKE
D: Okay... so what you're saying is we’re going to be exclusive then?
C: KIT
D: Yes.
C: MIKE
D: Both of us?
C: KIT
D: Yes.
C: MIKE
D: Because if you want more than--
C: KIT
D: No. I just want you.
N: As they stare at each other, Mike can't help but smile. That's exactly what he needed to hear.
C: KIT
D: So, can I give you your gift now?
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: You may.
C: KIT
D: Close your eyes.
N: Kit walks Mike over to the closet and slides the door open.
C: KIT
D: Okay. Open your eyes.
E: CONT'D
N: Half the closet space has been cleared and Kit has made a beautiful little tastefully made "MIKE" nameplate that hangs at eye level.
C: MIKE
D: Did you make that?
N: Kit nods. Mike is moved by the meaning behind the gift. Kit, meanwhile, grabs the magic wand out of the Sneaky Pete's Magic Set and playfully demonstrates how a closet works, grabbing Mike's folded-up clothes on the floor and setting them on the various shelves.
C: KIT
D: You can put your sleep shorts here... voila! And you can hang your pants on a hanger like this... voila! And you can put your wallet and keys and various sundries here... voila!
C: MIKE
D: Oh, that's where the sundries go. I wasn't sure.
E: mock enlightened
C: KIT
D: Yep. Yep.
N: Mike is throughly entertained and charmed by the impromptu magic show Kit is putting on. As they kiss...
S: INT. KIT STUDIO APT - NIGHT — DEC 2001
N: Close on Mike and Kit’s faces as they make love. Mike’s far less hesitant now. They are both in the zone...
C: KIT
D: Oh, my God! I love you!!!
S: INT. KIT STUDIO APT - LATER
N: Mike and Kit lie in bed, flushed and spent, both staring up at the ceiling. After an awkward silence...
C: KIT
D: Too soon?
C: MIKE
D: Not to feel. Maybe too soon to say? We don’t want to jinx things.
C: KIT
D: You know, if you silently say “olive juice” -- just mouth the words -- it looks exactly like you’re saying “I love you.”
N: Kit mouths the words “olive juice.”
C: MIKE
D: Wow, it does!
N: As they gently kiss...
C: KIT
D: Olive juice.
C: MIKE
D: Olive juice, too.
S: INT. KIT STUDIO APT — JAN 2002
N: Mike's pulling a sweater off the shelf of his now completely- packed side of the closet.
C: MIKE
D: Things were going so well, Kit decided it was time for me to meet his mother. Well not Kit, Kit's appendix.
E: V.O.
N: Kit's curled up in bed.
C: KIT
D: I don't think I can go. I'm sorry,
C: I don't feel good.
D: Take Nina, she loves screenings.
E: off Mike's worried look
N: As Mike goes over to feel his forehead...
C: MIKE
D: The movie was great. The message I got after the movie was not. We're about to go to a hospital, but don't worry, we're not at the bad part yet.
E: V.O.
S: INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - ER - LATER
N: Mike, breathless, reaches the Nurse Station. A weary NIGHT NURSE looks up from behind a COMPUTER.
C: MIKE
D: I'm here to see Kit Cowan. He was rushed here for surgery.
N: As the Nurse searches for Kit in the system...
C: NURSE
D: And you are?
C: MIKE
D: I’m his... boyfriend.
C: NURSE
D: There’s no Kit Cowan here.
C: MIKE
D: He said Mount Sinai. It’s Cowan with a “W.”
C: NURSE
D: There’s a Christopher Cowan.
E: off her screen
C: MIKE
D: Christopher Cowan? Yeah, that’s him. Obviously. Christopher.
E: covering
N: Mike's phone buzzes, he looks at the caller ID.
C: MIKE
D: Shit.
E: CONT'D
N: Mike stares at his flip phone as it keeps ringing...
C: NURSE
D: You going to answer that?
C: MIKE
D: It's his mother. Oh god, he asked me to call her and tell her not to come to the hospital. I've never even met the woman.
C: NURSE
D: How long have you known this guy?
C: MIKE
D: Jesus, Mary and Joseph... Hello... Yes, this is Mike. Is this Mrs. Cowan?... Yes, Christopher’s fine... It was just a little touch of appendicitis... Yep, he said there’s no reason for you to come... He’s okay, really. He’s at a wonderful hospital... Mount Sinai, but you don’t have to worry... 10th Avenue... Between 58th and 59th... Michael... Ausiello... No, you wouldn’t have, we only recently met... Through friends... Yes. Yes... I’ll tell him you’re coming. Shit.
E: finally answering ending the call
S: INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM - LATER
N: Mike tiptoes in... As soon as he sees Kit, incapacitated and hooked up to an IV, his heart skips a beat. Kit manages a smile as Mike leans in and gives him a kiss.
C: KIT
D: You’re here...
C: MIKE
D: How do you feel?
C: KIT
D: Can't really feel much of anything at the moment. Did you call her? When does she arrive?
E: beat off his look
C: MIKE
D: She'll be here by morning. Sorry.
C: KIT
D: Sorry I put you in that position.
C: MIKE
D: I told her I was just a friend...
C: KIT
D: Speaking of which, I need another favor. She stays with me when she comes. I need you to swing by my apartment and... clean up.
C: MIKE
D: Like make the bed?
C: KIT
D: No. I don’t remember what I left lying around.
C: MIKE
D: You want me to de-gay your apartment.
C: KIT
D: I didn't say that. Just get rid of the cum rag next to the bed. And the porn DVDs. And the mini statue of David with the erect penis.
N: Mike is calmly taking this all in.
C: KIT
D: And probably your Christmas gift...
E: CONT'D hesitates
N: That one wounds Mike a little.
C: KIT
D: And there's a box of, um...
E: CONT'D sheepishly MORE
C: KIT
D: toys under the bed. Make sure the lid is on it really good.
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: Toys? Ah...
E: beat, does the math
C: KIT
D: Like really put your weight into it. Make sure you hear it click.
C: MIKE
D: Got it. So, to recap: You want me to de-gay your apartment.
C: KIT
D: Yes, please. I'm sorry I'm such a closet case. Olive juice?
E: beat
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, I love juice too.
S: INT. KIT STUDIO APT - DAY - JAN 2002
N: Mike’s on the bed, the BOX on his lap. As he pokes around inside, we hear rattling and clanking. His expression fluctuates between curiosity, shock, and interest.
C: MIKE
D: Wow.
N: Mike stares down at the box of sex toys, then... QUICK SHOTS: Mike dumping LUBE and CONDOMS into a pillow case... The Fucking Dinosaurs and the Peter Meter are next... Mike looks at the AbFab tapes and hesitates...
C: MIKE
D: Could be a tell.
E: CONT'D
N: Mike tosses the AbFab tapes into the pillow case. Just before he leaves he remembers Kit's Christmas gift to him. He opens the closet door and reluctantly pulls the “MIKE” nameplate down.
S: INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM - LATER
N: Mike heads in, finds Kit on the edge of his bed. Mike sets a DOCTOR SMURF figurine down on his tray.
C: MIKE
D: I brought a world class surgeon to help with the case...
C: MARILYN
D: They’re ready to discharge you.
E: O.C.
N: Mike turns to see MARILYN COWAN, 60s, as no-nonsense as advertised, standing in the door.
C: MIKE
D: You must be Mrs. Cowan. We spoke. On the phone. Last night. I’m Mike.
N: Marilyn nods, then turns to Kit, noticing Doctor Smurf. She looks at it with an equal measure of confusion and fear. As she begins to gather Kit’s things, Mike butches it up.
C: MIKE
D: You missed a good match last night, man. I mean, game. Man.
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: What are you doing?
E: whispering
C: MIKE
D: So you're feeling better, dude?
C: KIT
D: Stop it. Stop. I told her. I told her.
E: whispering a little louder
N: Mike suddenly gets it. Shocked, he turns to Marilyn, who’s now looking back at them, holding up Kit’s pants.
C: MARILYN
D: Kit needs to get dressed.
N: No one moves, the tension is palpable... it finally dawns on him what she means.
C: MIKE
D: Oh... I’ll step out.
C: MARILYN
D: No. Stay. It’s not like you haven’t seen him with his pants off.
C: KIT
D: Mom! Jesus!
C: MARILYN
D: What? You tell me you’re gay and a split second later the room fills with gay people.
C: KIT
D: One gay person, Mom, my boyfriend.
N: Michael is moved hearing Kit refer to him as his boyfriend.
C: MARILYN
D: I can’t even have a moment to talk with you alone about this?
C: MIKE
D: I’ll go.
C: KIT
D: No. Stay.
N: A frozen Mike flashes a "I've died and gone to hell" look.
C: MARILYN
D: Stay! Kit obviously doesn’t want to be alone with his mother!
C: KIT MARILYN
D: Mom-- I’m sorry I’m not maternal.
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: I never said that--
C: MARILYN
D: Warm. I’m sorry I’m not warm. And I’m sorry I did whatever I did that made you feel like you couldn’t tell me... until... You had no choice.
E: off Mike
N: Mike stares dumbfounded at the scene unfolding before him...
C: KIT
D: I didn't want to tell you until... I met someone.
N: That stops Marilyn cold. She looks Mike up and down, her expression impossible to read.
C: MARILYN
D: I’m going to find a nurse.
N: Marilyn strides out of the room.
C: KIT
D: I tried to warn you.
C: MIKE
D: Did you really just come out to your mother for me?
C: KIT
D: Not you. Us.
C: MIKE
D: Olive juice.
C: KIT
D: I love Jews, too.
C: MIKE
D: I love Lucy.
N: Mike stares at him for a moment.
C: MIKE
D: I love you.
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: I love you.
N: Marilyn walks back in, followed immediately by a nurse with a wheelchair.
C: KIT
D: My ride's here!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. KIT APARTMENT — LATER
N: Kit slowly enters, with Marilyn right by his side. She is carrying all of the suitcases and bags. A slightly deflated Mike pulls up the rear looking every bit the third wheel. As Kit gets settled into bed, Marilyn places the suitcases on and around Kit's desk. She clocks the Sneaky Pete's Magic Set with the Christmas bow still on top. She connects the dots and it stings. She quietly locks eyes with Mike.
C: MIKE
D: Um.... Kit, while you settle in, I'll go pick up some dinner.
E: swallows hard
C: MARILYN
D: It's taken care of, Mark.
C: KIT
D: It's Mike, mom.
C: MARILYN
D: I made Kit's favorite. It's in the duffel. Pig's stomach soup.
E: to Kit, enthused
N: Mike cackles loudly... before quickly stopping himself when he realizes she wasn't kidding.
C: MARILYN
D: Maybe go ahead and put it in the fridge, Mike?
E: CONT'D to Mike, pointed
C: MIKE
D: On it.
N: Mike exits for the kitchen with the duffel bag.
S: INT. KIT APARTMENT — KITCHEN — MINUTES LATER
N: Mike is unpacking the duffel bag and realizes Marilyn brought a lot more than just soup. There's fresh fruit, bread, cookies, and various Tupperware containers with assorted homemade goodies. They're all perfectly wrapped/labeled. Her attention to detail and level of care is not lost on Mike.
S: INT. KIT APARTMENT — MINUTES LATER
N: Mike enters the main living area and finds Kit is gone.
C: MIKE
D: Where's the patient?
E: concerned
C: MARILYN
D: Bathroom.
C: MIKE
D: Is he OK?
C: MARILYN
D: Yes.
N: Marilyn stops what she's doing and abruptly turns to Mike.
C: MARILYN
D: I can take it from here.
E: CONT'D resolute
C: MIKE
D: Mrs. Cowan, I...
E: reluctant
C: MARILYN
D: I'm only here a day. Please let me take care of my son. You can have him back tomorrow.
E: interrupts, fighting back tears
N: Mike is thrown by Marilyn's sudden burst of vulnerability. He backs down. Kit enters the bedroom and can immediately feel the tension in the room.
C: MIKE
D: I think I'm gonna go. You good?
E: to Kit, whispers
C: KIT I am good.
D: Thank you.
E: beat, whispers sweetly
N: Mike and Kit exchange "olive juices" with their mouths.
C: MIKE
D: Mrs. Cowan, nice to meet you.
C: MARILYN
D: Nice to meet you too, Mike. And it's Marilyn.
E: turns to him
N: Mike accepts the olive branch as he heads out.
S: EXT. CHRISTMAS TREE LOT - DAY - DEC 2002
N: As Mike and Kit choose a Christmas tree...
C: MIKE
D: It wasn't long after Marilyn went back to Millersburg that we moved into our first apartment together. It was a modest one bedroom in my favorite neighborhood, the West Village.
E: V.O.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - NIGHT - NOV 2002
N: Mike and Kit's home furnished with a tasteful mix of classic mid-century furniture, eclectic novelty items and... Smurfs. We see Mike lining up more than a few of his prized Smurf figurines on an exposed section of their Hans Wegner wall unit under the watchful eye of Kit, who is trying to contain his agony. Kit motions to Mike that he has a better idea.
C: MIKE V.O.
D: There was an adjustment period, during which compromises were made.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Kit is back in front of the wall unit, but this time he has relocated Mike's Smurfs to one of the wall unit's shelves that are hidden behind a door. He also curated Mike's collection so the display looks more refined than flea market. Off Mike considering the compromise.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - NIGHT - DEC 2002
N: Mike’s in front of the small Douglas Fir tree they chose. With child-like joy, he’s adding thick layers of tinsel strands. Kit looks on warily.
C: MIKE V.O.
D: Christmas proved especially challenging...
C: KIT
D: You know, less is more, especially with tinsel.
C: MIKE
D: What are you, the tinsel police?
E: playfully
N: Kit points out a particular ornament -- a knitted Smurf.
C: KIT
D: That one needs to be retired. It looks like he was shot in the face with a bazooka.
N: Kit’s gone too far. Mike looks hurt, actually tearing up.
C: KIT
D: I’m sure he has a nice personality.
E: CONT'D
N: Mike’s too upset now, he turns and walks away.
C: KIT
D: Come on, I was joking.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Mike’s on the bed. Kit stands in the doorway.
C: KIT
D: I was just art directing. Art directors are notorious pricks.
C: MIKE
D: My mom made that ornament, you notorious prick.
C: KIT
D: I'm sorry. I think I'm still adjusting to the... blending of our styles. I've never lived with anyone before.
E: sighs
C: MIKE
D: Neither have I.
C: KIT
D: Look, I made all the big decorating decisions in the apartment. It's only fair that you have some autonomy with the Christmas tree.
C: MIKE
D: Really?
E: skeptical
C: KIT
D: Yes. This year. Next year I'm in charge of the Christmas tree.
N: Mike considers the compromise.
C: MIKE
D: Deal.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - LATER
N: Kit's eyes are covered as Mike switches on the tree lights. The tree looks... very Michael.
C: MIKE
D: OK, you can look now.
C: KIT
D: Oooooh. Oh, I see what you did there. Nice. Respectable tinsel spacing in the lower quadrant, yep, yep.
E: pulling his hands away from his eyes playfully assumes role of art critic, vamping beat, eyes moving around the tree
C: MIKE
D: You hate it.
C: KIT
D: Star on top — bold.
E: silliness continues
N: Mike slides under the tree flat on his back with his head looking straight up into the lights.
C: KIT
D: What's happening.
E: CONT'D confused
C: MIKE
D: Join me.
N: Kit joins him under the tree.
C: MIKE
D: When I was a kid I would spend countless hours doing this. I loved how the tree looked from this perspective. Just a jumble of lights and ornaments and tinsel... There's something magical about it.
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: I love your love of Christmas.
C: MIKE
D: My little shop is going to have the most amazing Christmas display. It's gonna take your breath away when you walk past the storefront.
C: KIT
D: Could this shop by any chance also sell an aggressively curated selection of mid-century furniture and original photography?
C: MIKE
D: I'd have to ask the owner, but I don't see why not. He's very agreeable.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT — DEC 2003
N: Mike and Kit lounge in their apartment. MISTER SCOOCH, their new cat, explores his new lair.
C: MIKE
D: Things were perfect for a while. Deciding to take turns decorating our Christmas tree really helped.
E: V.O.
N: We watch as Mike slyly rolls his eyes at the very different looking silver aluminum Christmas tree with all black ornaments that stands in the corner.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - MONTAGE
N: We see a series of PHOTOGRAPHS. Mike and Kit standing next to their very distinct versions of a CHRISTMAS TREE.
C: MIKE
D: Thirteen years go by pretty quick when you count by trees.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE REVEL HOTEL AND CASINO - SUITE — FEB 2014
N: Mike walks in to find Kit lying on the sofa.
C: KIT
D: So how much did you win?
C: MIKE
D: Seven hundred dollars. Your doctor's appointment is tomorrow, right?
E: then, emphatically
N: Kit nods, unconvincingly.
C: MIKE
D: You did make an appointment, right?
E: CONT'D
N: Kit nods, again unconvincingly.
C: MIKE
D: OK, out with it.
E: CONT'D
N: Kit winces, looks up at Mike, and knows he can't keep lying.
C: KIT
D: My appointment was yesterday. They found a growth. In my butt.
E: beat
C: MIKE
D: What... ?
E: panicked
C: KIT
D: They don’t know what it is. It could be nothing. It might be a giant hemorrhoid. I’m getting it biopsied on Wednesday.
C: MIKE
D: Why didn't you tell me?
C: KIT
D: I didn't want to ruin your party.
C: MIKE
D: I'm going with you.
C: KIT
D: It's just a biopsy.
C: MIKE
D: I'm going with you. Not up for discussion. Do you want me to sleep here tonight?
E: beat
C: KIT
D: No, I'm fine.
C: MIKE
D: Are you sure?
C: KIT
D: Yes.
C: MIKE
D: Text me if you need anything.
C: KIT
D: I will. I promise.
N: A clearly concerned Mike exits Kit's suite.
S: INT. THE REVEL HOTEL AND CASINO - HALLWAY — CONTINUOUS
N: We follow Mike as he walks down to the other end of the hallway, removes his key card and enters a different room.
S: INT. THE REVEL HOTEL AND CASINO - MIKE'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS
N: Mike enters and we see that his open suitcase is on the desk and he has clothes spread about. It's clear in this moment that — twist! — Mike and Kit are not sharing a room.
S: INT. TVLINE OFFICE — MIKE’S OFFICE - FEB 2014
N: A corner office, with two Mario Bellini couches and an Edward Wormley mahogany pedestal desk. Windows overlook Midtown. PHOTOS highlight his fifteen-year career on the walls. Mike rushes out the door, as he gives orders to his assistant ERIC, 20s.
C: MIKE
D: Netflix is buying all seven seasons of Gilmore Girls. I want a package. Twenty-five Best Episodes and Five Worst. Up today.
N: Eric leaves, and just as Mike's about to, Nick appears.
C: NICK
D: Time for lunch and you're paying. I lost a month's worth of commissions on your birthday, so...
N: Mike stares at him, trying to figure out what to say.
C: NICK
D: What's wrong? Did they cancel Community again?
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: I'm sorry. I can't go, something came up.
C: NICK
D: You can deal with it after lunch.
C: MIKE I actually can't.
D: It’s Kit. I have to go to the hospital. He's getting a biopsy. You can't tell anyone.
E: then
C: NICK
D: What's wrong?
C: MIKE
D: They found a growth.
C: NICK
D: Whoa...
C: MIKE
D: It could be nothing. It could be something.
C: NICK
D: Are you sure you're up for this?
C: MIKE
D: Do I have a choice?
C: NICK
D: Actually, you do now. You guys broke up.
C: MIKE
D: He came to my birthday party. I can go to his biopsy.
C: MIKE
D: So... you're probably wondering about the breakup. It happened a few weeks before Atlantic City, but the trip was already planned and invitations had gone out and we didn't want to turn a birthday celebration into a pity party. So we waited and told everyone the following week.
E: V.O.
N: CHYRON: DELETED SCENES
S: EXT. TRIBECA ART GALLERY — DAY — MAR 2008
N: A stressed-looking Kit steps outside for some air. Mike follows him.
C: MIKE
D: Like every couple, we had our issues.
E: V.O.
C: MIKE
D: What is going on with you?
C: KIT
D: I'm just tired.
C: MIKE
D: Everyone loves your work. Tonight is a big success.
E: not buying it
C: KIT
D: They're just being polite. It's a disaster. The retouching on the gazebo print is just... sloppy.
C: MIKE
D: I feel like we are at different events...
C: KIT
D: Everyone standing around judging. I appreciate you doing this for me. Renting the space. Paying for the catering. But this isn't me.
E: beat
C: MIKE
D: You are so talented. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life designing sandwich boards?
N: That one hurt Kit, and Mike knows it.
C: MIKE
D: I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like...
E: CONT'D
N: Kit turns around and walks back inside.
C: MIKE
D: I never got Kit to show his photography again.
E: V.O.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT’S APARTMENT — BEDROOM -- 2012
N: Mike and Kit lie in bed. Mister Scooch is nearby. Mike's on his laptop, Kit's on Grindr. Mike clocks this.
C: MIKE
D: We agreed no Grindr-ing in front of company.
C: KIT
D: Mister Scooch isn’t company. He’s family.
E: MORE
C: KIT
D: Did you hear what your father just called you?
E: CONT'D to Mister Scooch, playfully
C: MIKE
D: You were on it during dinner. Everyone saw.
C: KIT
D: No one saw. I was on for two seconds while you were telling your Gilmore Girls story for the 26th time this month.
N: Mike slowly closes his laptop.
C: KIT
D: Uh-oh. Mister Scooch, he’s putting his work down. This is serious.
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: Stop it.
E: voice raised
N: Startled, Mister Scooch hops off the bed.
C: MIKE
D: You’re high.
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: Wow, I’m not doing anything right, tonight, am I?
E: voice raised
C: MIKE
D: I’m sorry I tried to have an adult conversation with you...
C: KIT
D: What’s the big deal if they saw me on Grindr anyway? I was just window shopping. That was our agreement: Looking but no touching.
E: interrupts
C: MIKE
D: They don’t know that.
C: KIT
D: Who cares what they think?
C: MIKE
D: It’s embarrassing.
C: KIT
D: For who? And why? I should be embarrassed because I’m still interested in sex?
C: MIKE
D: Oh, and I’m not?
C: KIT
D: Not with me.
C: MIKE
D: You’re not exactly ripping my clothes off these days.
C: KIT
D: Hard to rip your clothes off when they’re dead-bolted to your body.
E: mumbles
N: That one stung.
C: MIKE
D: Good night.
C: KIT
D: Let’s have sex now.
N: Mike shuts the light off on his end table and begins to retreat under the covers.
C: KIT
D: I mean it.
E: CONT'D
N: Kit starts aggressively tugging at Mike’s t-shirt.
C: MIKE
D: Stop it.
N: Mike tries to fend him off but Kit is determined to get Mike’s t-shirt off.
C: MIKE
D: I said enough.
E: CONT'D
N: Kit raises his hands in the air as Mike quickly pulls his shirt back down.
C: KIT
D: Let the record show: I tried.
C: MIKE
D: Even though he denied it, I was pretty sure Kit was doing more than just chatting with guys on Grindr. Kit's wandering eye had been a recurring issue, with each bump in the road getting smoothed over by couple's therapy and my own fear- driven denial. But then Kit took a job as art director of a fancy midcentury furniture shop and, as my terrible luck would have it, one of his co-workers was Olympic diver and international gay icon Tom Daley.
E: V.O.
S: INT. WYETH — NIGHT —NOV. 2013
N: Mike rushes in pulling a rolling bag. A reception is just winding down. Mike looks around and spots Kit talking to another coworker Todd, 27, gorgeous.
C: MIKE
D: Well, Tom Daley’s doppelgänger, at least.
E: V.O.
N: Kit spots Mike and heads over.
C: MIKE
D: I’m sorry. The cab driver took the Manhattan Bridge even though I specifically told him to take the Midtown Tunnel.
C: KIT
D: You should’ve just taken it home. Hans Wegner’s family already left.
C: MIKE
D: Fuck. I’m sorry, Kit.
C: KIT
D: It’s OK. Go home and unpack. We’re just tidying up here.
N: Mike eyes Todd in the distance.
C: MIKE
D: Let me stay and help. It’s the least I can do.
C: KIT
D: Nope. We’re good. See you at home.
N: Kit gives Mike a peck on the cheek before rejoining Todd, who is now soaking wet wearing nothing but a speedo and both of his Olympic bronze medals around his neck.
C: MIKE
D: So that’s Todd. I don’t even know if Todd can swim let alone dive. All I knew for sure was that I hated him.
E: V.O. beat
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM -- LATER
N: Mike is drinking a glass of wine while watching Chelsea Lately, as Kit enters.
C: KIT
D: You’re still up.

C: KIT
D: A bunch of us went out for a bite to eat.
C: MIKE
D: Who all went?
C: KIT
D: You mean was Todd there? Yes. Todd was there.
E: sighs
C: MIKE
D: Are you fucking him?
C: KIT
D: You’re drunk.
C: MIKE
D: Answer the question.
C: KIT
D: No, I am not fucking Todd. How many times do I have to tell you that?
C: MIKE
D: I suppose as many as it takes for me to believe you.
C: KIT
D: Well, I didn’t believe you when you said you would make it back from LA in time for tonight’s reception, which you knew was important to me.
N: That one lands. There's a deafening silence between them.
C: KIT
D: I’m hopping in the shower and going to bed.
E: CONT'D
N: Kit exits as Mike’s eyes begin to well up. He shuts the TV off, stands and walks to the bedroom. Kit is disrobing. Mike stops at the doorway, his head down. He's crying.
C: KIT
D: This isn't working. We're miserable. I'm miserable.
E: CONT'D beat
C: MIKE
D: I'll call Tony. Maybe he can squeeze us in for...
C: KIT
D: No. I'm not climbing back into that hamster wheel. It's a no-win situation for me. As long as you weren't the one who cheated you can claim the moral high ground.
E: interrupts
C: MIKE
D: So it's my fault because I never fucked around behind your back? Do you want me to invent a few one- night stands so you feel like the playing field is more even? I'm sorry I'm not like you.
E: anger building beat
N: Mike immediately regrets saying that. But it's too late.
C: KIT
D: The only reason you're not like me is because...
C: MIKE
D: Say it.
N: As Kit is about to head into the bathroom...
C: MIKE
D: Say it. Because no other guy would want to sleep with me.
E: CONT'D beat
C: KIT
D: I was not going to say that. Don't put that on me. Our problem has never been about the way I see you. That's your fucking baggage.
E: adamant
N: Kit heads for the bathroom. Off Mike processing everything...
C: MIKE
D: A week later he got his own place in Brooklyn...

C: DR. VOIT
D: Michael Ausiello?
E: O.C.
N: Mike looks up as DR. VOIT, 50s, walks over. He sits down next to Mike, who braces himself for the news.
C: DR. VOIT
D: You're Christopher’s partner?
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: Yes.
E: awkward pause
C: DR. VOIT
D: I’m concerned about Christopher.
C: MIKE
D: It’s cancer.
C: DR. VOIT
D: Does cancer run in his family?
C: MIKE
D: No. I don't know. My mother died of cancer.
E: beat
C: DR. VOIT
D: I’m sorry to hear that. We don’t know what Christopher has yet. I just told him the growth was a lot bigger than I anticipated. We took a piece for testing, we’ll have the results in a few days. Whatever it is, we’ll treat it.
C: MIKE
D: Can I see him?
C: DR. VOIT
D: Of course. He's still a little out of it. He shouldn’t be alone for the next twenty-four to forty-eight hours. I assume you guys live together?
N: Off Mike's unconvincing nod...
S: INT. NYC HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM - LATER
N: Mike sits next to Kit, who’s out of it, his eyes just beginning to open.
C: MIKE
D: Hey. How you doing?
C: KIT
D: I’m cold. Where am I? Where’s my camera?
C: MIKE
D: You’re at the hospital.
E: pulling a blanket up
C: KIT
D: I want to go home.
C: MIKE
D: You can, soon, but someone has to stay with you... I can call Nina or your parents, but then you have to tell them what's going on.
C: KIT
D: What’s going on?
E: looking very confused
C: MIKE
D: The doctor said he filled you in...
C: KIT
D: He did? Maybe he did.
N: Mike starts to realize how out of it Kit is right now.
C: MIKE
D: You can stay with me for a couple of days.
C: KIT
D: I live with you.
C: MIKE
D: No, actually, you don’t.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT — BEDROOM — NIGHT
N: Mike’s trying to get Kit into bed, who's still groggy.

C: MIKE
D: You'll go home Friday. Forty-eight hours, they said. Take your pills.
N: Kit swallows the pills and looks at him, a little afraid to ask...
C: KIT
D: Tell me what the doctor said.
C: MIKE
D: It’ll take a week for the results to come back.
C: KIT
D: I didn't leave any pot here, did I?
N: Off Mike shaking his head...

N: Mike is making the SOFA up with sheets and a blanket so he can sleep on it...
S: INT. WYETH — DAY - MAR 2014
N: Mike walks in and sees Todd, the last person he hoped was working today. He walks over to him, seeming pretty upbeat.
C: MIKE
D: Hey, Todd. Nice to see you dry.
C: TODD
D: What?
C: MIKE
D: Nothing.
C: TODD
D: Did you have a good birthday party? Forty's a big one. Huge.
C: MIKE
D: Kit asked me to pick up his camera.
C: TODD
D: How's he doing? He hasn't been in all week.
C: MIKE
D: He's fine. I just need his camera.
N: There's an awkward silence...
C: TODD
D: I'll go get it.
N: Off Mike wishing he wasn't here...
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - BEDROOM - LATER
N: Mike comes home to find Kit in an ill-fitting bathrobe, packing weed into a pipe, watching Drag Race.
C: MIKE
D: Where’d you get that?
C: KIT
D: It's yours.
E: off bathrobe
C: MIKE
D: I meant the pot.
C: KIT
D: You can get it delivered. It’s New York City, Mike. The queens are killing it this season. What?

C: MIKE
D: Please forgive me for being late...
C: KRISTEN
D: Mike, don’t worry about it.
C: PUBLICIST
D: We need to get started. She has to get to Letterman.
N: ANGLE ON: Mike being mic’d by the Sound Guy. Mike’s phone buzzes. He checks the caller ID.
C: MIKE
D: I’m so sorry, I have to take this.
N: Bell looks confused, Eric looks bewildered, and Bell’s Publicist looks apoplectic.
S: INT. TVLINE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Mike ducks into a corner and takes the call.
C: MIKE
D: Hi.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT’S WEST VILLAGE APT — LIVING ROOM - INTERCUT
N: Kit’s strangely calm...
C: KIT
D: It’s a neuroendocrine tumor.
C: MIKE
D: A neuro-what?
C: KIT
D: N-E-U-R-O-E-N-D-O-C-R-I-N-E
E: spelling it
C: MIKE
D: Let me get a pen.
N: Mike grabs one and scribbles it down on a scrap of paper.
C: KIT
D: They gave me a number for an oncologist.
C: MIKE
D: What else did the doctor say?
C: KIT
D: Nothing. That’s it.
C: MIKE
D: So it’s cancer.
C: KIT
D: Yeah. I just said that.
N: Off Mike looking at that scrap of paper.
S: INT. TVLINE OFFICE - MIKE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: When Mike returns, the Sound Guy’s staring at him. Mike sees the mic clipped to his shirt. The Sound Guy heard everything. Mike’s at a loss for words. Kristen picks up on Mike's distress as he retakes his seat across from her.
C: KRISTEN
D: Everything OK?
C: MIKE
D: Yep. Sorry again for the delay.
E: trying to shrug it off beat
C: KRISTEN
D: No worries.
N: The makeup artist quickly approaches Michael.
C: MAKEUP ARIST
D: You're a little shiny...
N: She proceeds to powder his sweaty forehead. She steps back to survey the result.
C: MAKEUP ARIST
D: All better.
E: CONT'D
N: The makeup exits the shot.
C: CAMERA GUY
D: And... we're rolling.
N: Mike shifts into interview mode. He flashes a wide smile at the camera.
C: MIKE
D: I’m here with Veronica Mars herself, Kristen Bell. So nice to have you here.
C: BELL
D: I'm glad to be here.
C: MIKE
D: After all the blood, sweat and tears you — and the fans — put into making this movie revival happen, how does it feel to be just days away from its release?
C: KRISTEN
D: It’s hard to articulate. It's overwhelming, it's exciting, it's a little nerve-wracking, because it's really important to me that the fans who funded this movie are satisfied.
N: Mike tries mightily to stay focused as Kristen talks, but we can see the struggle in his eyes (and once again on shiny forehead).
S: INT. TVLINE OFFICE - MIKE'S OFFICE - LATER
N: Mike’s alone now, typing “neuroendocrine tumors” into a search engine. ANGLE ON: the search results, one after another... “Many are benign...” “Malignant tumors tend to...” “Poorly differentiated...”
C: MIKE
D: “Neuroendocrine tumors are neoplasms cells from the endocrine and nervous systems...” “Many are benign...” I liked the sound of that... Then I made the mistake of adding rectum to the search...
E: V.O.
N: ANGLE ON: Mike typing RECTUM after NEUROENDROCRINE TUMOR. More results flood in...
C: MIKE
D: “Prognosis is poor in those rare cases where the neuroendocrine tumor is located in the rectum... It is almost always fatal... Life expectancy less than one year.”
E: V.O.
N: Mike slams his laptop shut.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Mike comes home to find Kit dressed, the bag he took to the hospital by his side.
C: MIKE
D: Where are you going?
C: KIT
D: Home. To Brooklyn.
C: MIKE
D: Stay here.
C: KIT
D: It's been forty-eight hours. I've been enough of an imposition.
C: MIKE
D: It's no imposition. Honestly.
C: KIT
D: I know this is bringing up a lot of stuff for you. But I'm not your mother.
E: clocks concern in Mike's eyes
C: MIKE
D: I know.
E: defensive
N: They stare at each other for a moment...
C: KIT
D: So how bad is it? You went online. I know you.
E: off his silence
C: MIKE
D: I did some digging.
C: KIT
D: So?
C: MIKE
D: It’s the same cancer Steve Jobs had.
C: KIT
D: That can’t be good.
C: MIKE
D: But he had it on his pancreas. And he delayed treatment.
C: KIT
D: I won’t make that mistake. Anything else?
N: Mike takes a moment... and then lies.
C: MIKE
D: It turns out this kind of cancer is rare so there wasn’t a whole lot of info. I got the names of the city’s three best neuroendocrine experts.
C: KIT
D: You made a list?
C: MIKE
D: When you get better, you can go back to your hovel. Right now you need to be here, in Manhattan, where the doctors are. Perfectly healthy people have died waiting for L trains that never came!
C: KIT
D: Is this how you are at work?
C: MIKE
D: I’m a top at the office.
C: KIT
D: Can I at least get some clothes?
S: INT. KIT'S BROOKLYN APT — DAY — MAR 2014
N: Mike scans the room for the first time. He’s never seen Kit's apartment. His bedroom wall is bare. His framed photos from the 2008 art show are leaning against the wall.
C: MIKE
D: These are beautiful. I'll never understand why you won't...
C: KIT
D: Mike...
E: shutting him down
C: MIKE
D: I'm sorry.
N: Mike turns to see Kit moving slowly, clearly in pain, as he sets a duffle bag on the bed.
C: MIKE
D: Sit. You point, I’ll pack.
E: CONT'D
N: Grateful, Kit gingerly lowers himself onto the bed while Mike starts to fill the duffel bag with clothes from Kit’s closet.
C: KIT
D: You don't have to do any of this.
C: MIKE
D: I know. Where's your pot?
N: Kit points to the bedside table. Mike opens the drawer, takes out a Tupperware container, puts it in the duffel bag. Kit winces in pain.
C: MIKE
D: When are you going to tell your parents?
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: When I know exactly what we're dealing with.
S: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY — MAR 2014
N: Mike and Kit sit in front of DOCTOR BARNES, Mike clearly running the room.
C: MIKE
D: So, is surgery an option?
C: DOCTOR
D: It could be. But you need to start chemotherapy immediately.
C: MIKE
D: You mind if I record this?
E: holding up his cell
C: KIT
D: Sorry. He’s a journalist.
S: EXT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY - MAR 2014
N: Kit and Mike are at a table, menus in front of them, listening to the recording Mike made of Doctor Barnes on his phone.

D: How many more do I have to meet?
C: MIKE
D: Just one. And then you can pick.
C: KIT
D: How do people work for you? You’re exhausting.
S: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET — DAY
C: MIKE
D: Our last oncologist was Dr. Carrie Bradshaw.
E: V.O.
N: CLOSE ON: DR. DAVIS, 30s, her makeup and hair perfect, wearing a halter top and short skirt, walking down the sidewalk... A very Sex and The City opening credits vibe.
C: MIKE
D: Well, she looked like and dressed the Sex and the City icon. I got a good vibe from her.
E: V.O.
N: Close on the wheels of a BUS heading toward a PUDDLE. Cut to Mike, who's now the one walking down the street.
C: MIKE
D: Until she opened her mouth.
E: V.O.
N: Mike tries to avoid it but the bus sprays him with water. He looks up to see an ad on the side of the bus featuring a glamor shot of Dr. Davis, with copy reading, "Dr. Davis Knows Cancer."
S: INT. SLOAN KETTERING - EXAM ROOM - LATER
N: Kit and Mike sit across from Dr. Davis. Kit shifts in his seat. He can’t get comfortable.
C: DR. DAVIS
D: You have an extremely aggressive form of cancer.
C: MIKE
D: She wasn't Carrie Bradshaw. She was the Grim Reaper.
E: V.O.
C: MIKE
D: The other oncologists said that between chemo and radiation, there’s a lot of hope here.
C: DR. DAVIS
D: The problem is his tumor is already at an advanced stage.
N: Mike and Kit quickly lock eyes.
C: KIT
D: What stage are we talking?
C: DR. DAVIS
D: Stage four. I’m sorry.
N: The air goes out of the room...
C: KIT
D: No one’s said anything about a stage before...
N: Mike turns to Kit, wanting to say something to help, but he can’t find the words.
C: KIT
D: What are we looking at here, Doc?
E: CONT'D
C: DR. DAVIS
D: In terms of time?
C: KIT
D: Yes.
C: DR. DAVIS
D: We don’t like to give numbers. Patients are not numbers--
C: KIT
D: Please, Doctor.
C: DR. DAVIS
D: About a year.
N: Mike reaches out his hand to Kit who pulls away.
C: KIT
D: I need a minute. Please give me a minute.
N: Dr. Davis nods, stands and leaves, quietly closing the door. Mike and Kit sit alone...
C: KIT
D: I need a minute.
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: I’m not leaving you alone.
C: KIT
D: I need a minute!
E: screaming
N: His intensity hits Mike in the gut as Kit rushes into the exam room’s private bathroom, closing the door behind him. Mike stands there helplessly. Then he hears Kit start to cry. Mike can barely stand to listen as Kit HOWLS in despair. Mike can’t take it anymore. He rushes out to...
S: INT. SLOAN KETTERING - HALL - MOMENTS LATER
N: Mike catches up with Dr. Davis...
C: MIKE
D: Please, Dr. Davis. Say something to him. Anything.
S: INT. SLOAN KETTERING - EXAM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Mike follows Dr. Davis back in as Kit is exiting the bathroom, his eyes bloodshot now.
C: KIT
D: I’m okay.
C: DR. DAVIS
D: Christopher, everyone is different. And the year time frame is a range. It could be more than a year.
C: MIKE
D: So he could have more time?
C: DR. DAVIS
D: You could. But you need to start treatment as soon as possible.
C: MIKE
D: Despite Dr. Davis' questionable bedside manner, she won the oncologist bake-off. Sloane Kettering was the Rolls-Royce of cancer facilities.
E: V.O. MORE
C: MIKE
D: And as much as I tried to deny it, her dire prediction was in sync with what I secretly read on Web MD.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT — LIVING ROOM — NIGHT
N: Mike’s asleep on the sofa, when he stirs, thinking he hears something. Moaning? He looks at his phone: 3:30 AM.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - HALL - CONTINUOUS
N: Mike’s outside the bathroom door. Kit’s moaning is louder now, getting worse.
C: MIKE
D: Are you okay?
C: KIT
D: I feel like I’m pushing barbed wire out of my ass. I'm sorry I woke you. I'm the worst roommate. Can you hand me the issue of Dwell by the bed?
E: O.C. then off Mike's silence
N: Mike returns with the magazine and slides it under the door then sits against the wall outside the bathroom while Kit continues to moan.
C: MIKE
D: Do you still want to go tomorrow? I can cancel the car.
C: KIT
D: No. I need to tell them, and I want to do it in person. I can’t promise I won’t shit in the car.
E: then
C: MIKE
D: It’s a rental.
N: He can hear Kit laugh from the other side of the door.
S: INT./EXT. CAR - MILLERSBURG - SUSQUEHANNA RIVERBANK - LATER
N: Mike and Kit drive through the small town where Kit grew up. MUSIC from the car stereo plays in the background. Kit’s in the passenger seat, taking photos of the passing sights...
S: INT./EXT. CAR - MILLERSBURG - DOWNTOWN - LATER
N: As they head into downtown Millersburg, Mike narrates the sights with a teasing flourish.
C: MIKE
D: Sorrento’s Pizzeria is just up the street... Best subway sandwiches in the North East. And the beauty parlor over there used to be the five-and-dime. You'd buy candy with the money you made from school. You charged kids a nickel--
C: KIT
D: A dime.
C: MIKE
D: A dime to return their lunch trays and everyone had a spare dime because lunch cost ninety cents.
C: KIT
D: And that’s the Millersburger Hotel.
E: pointing
C: MIKE
D: Where you got your first real job.
C: KIT
D: And my first blowjob. From Andrea Sobiesk.
C: MIKE
D: You never told me that. Is there a historical marker? A bronze plaque?
S: INT./EXT. - MILLERSBURG - SIDE STREET - LATER
C: KIT
D: I’m going to need a hit.
N: Mike pulls over, shuts the engine off, and opens the windows. The sound of an occasional bird chirping and the river flowing in the distance. Kit packs a one hitter, takes a hit.
C: KIT
D: You know, Andrea still works at that hotel. If I weren’t gay, I probably never would have left this town either.
E: CONT'D then
C: MIKE
D: Gay did you a favor.
C: KIT
D: My parents don't know we broke up.
C: MIKE
D: Are you going to tell them?
C: KIT
D: Let's drop the first bomb and assess the damage. Either way, she's gonna want to come to New York for the chemo treatments. And... whatever comes after. I really don't want to give her a ringside seat but...
E: shrugs, then beat
N: Kit's gets choked up as he ponders the potential horrors of chemo.
C: KIT
D: As much as I don't want her to come, I may actually need her help.
E: CONT'D fighting back tears
C: MIKE
D: Kit, I can take some time off of work...
C: KIT
D: No. You are not doing that. Thank you, but no.
E: interrupts
N: Mike opts not to fight this particular battle now.
S: INT. KIT’S CHILDHOOD HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Mike and Kit sit on the couch in a cozy living room. Marilyn sits with BOB, 60s, much quieter than Marilyn. Kit’s trying not to look uncomfortable, but he’s in pain.
C: MARILYN
D: You should have let me know you were coming. There’s not enough food in the house.
C: BOB
D: What brings you boys down?
C: KIT
D: We have news. It’s not good.

S: EXT. KIT’S CHILDHOOD HOME - DRIVEWAY - LATER

C: MIKE
D: But...
E: thrown
C: MARILYN
D: Kit knows. He's busy fixing Bob's computer. Come on.
N: As Marilyn climbs into her and Bob's nearby SUV, Mike's face fills with dread.
S: INT. BOB AND MARILYN'S SUV — CONTINUOUS
N: Mike climbs into the passenger side of the SUV and closes the door. There's a moment of uncomfortable silence, during which it becomes clear that Marilyn is not making any effort to start the car. Mike reluctantly looks over and sees her crying. He mouths "fuck," before closing the door. There's an agonizing, heartbreaking silence. Michael reaches deep into his pocket and pulls out a tissue. He hands it to her.
C: MARILYN
D: He said he can beat it. Is that true?
E: composes herself
C: MIKE
D: That's what two out of three of New York's finest oncologists told us.
C: MARILYN
D: And the third?
C: MIKE
D: The third... was a real asshole about it.
E: chooses his words carefully
C: MARILYN
D: I knew he was gay...
C: MIKE
D: Oh boy...
E: mumbles
C: MARILYN
D: ...I acted like I was shocked when he told me, but I knew. I've known. I tried to convince myself otherwise. And I said nothing. All of those years he was dealing with this by himself all alone with no one to talk to... I could've been there for him.
C: MIKE
D: I think you're being a little hard on yourself...
C: MARILYN
D: All of those years I could've been getting to know my son for who he is and not for what I wanted him to be. I will never get that time back. So much wasted time. This is my long-winded way of saying I have a favor to ask.
E: beat
C: MIKE
D: OK...
E: tentative
C: MARILYN
D: I want to come to New York.
N: Mike was expecting this.
C: MARILYN
D: I promise I won't be a nuisance. Lord knows I don't want to make things worse for him. Maybe just once a month for an overnight.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: MARILYN
D: Bob and I will get a hotel room. Kit will fight me on it. But I want — I need — to get a little of that lost time back. Will you help me with that?
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: I will do my best.
C: MARILYN
D: Thank you. I know he's in good hands. I remember how you were with him after he got his appendix out. I felt threatened by it then. But now I'm just grateful. I am grateful he has you.
E: looks at Mike
N: There's an awkward silence.
C: MARILYN
D: He does have you, right?
E: CONT'D
N: Off Michael's conflicted expression, we...

N: RUTH, 40s, a chemo nurse, walks Mike and Kit past PATIENTS, IVs in their arms, while drugs drip into their systems, leading them to an INFUSION CHAIR. Mike’s not happy when he sees the chair.
C: MIKE
D: Excuse me. We were promised a bed.
C: KIT
D: Mike, it’s okay.
C: MIKE
D: No. No. It’s not okay.
C: RUTH
D: We don’t have any beds today. Have a seat. We’ll be right with you.
N: As Ruth walks off, Mike turns to Kit.
C: MIKE
D: Do not sit down. Hey!
E: calling out to the Nurse
C: MIKE
D: I don’t know what came over me.
E: V.O.
N: Mike chases after the nurse. He’s followed by a HAND HELD CAMERA... Mike hurries past a loudly MOANING PATIENT on a gurney as EDIE FALCO (loosely in character as Nurse Jackie) tends to him. He passes a PATIENT getting defibrillated by CHANDRA WILSON (loosely in character as Grey's Anatomy's Bailey)...
C: CHANDRA WILSON
D: Clear!
N: Mike rushes past a GRIEVING HUSBAND who’s weeping, having just been told his wife is dead by ZACH BRAFF (loosely in character as Scrubs' J.D.).
C: MIKE
D: Things quickly escalated into “Terms of Endearment” territory...
E: V.O.
N: Mike reaches the NURSE'S STATION, where he slams his hands down.
C: MIKE
D: Give my husband the bed!
C: RUTH
D: Sir, I’m afraid--
C: MIKE
D: Give my husband the bed! He has a rectal tumor the size of the Death Star. He’s in too much pain to sit for five minutes, much less four hours of chemo! He needs a bed. We were promised a bed!
C: RUTH
D: All the beds are occupied today.
C: MIKE
D: I don’t care where you find one! I don’t care if you have to drive to IKEA and buy one! You are going to give my husband a bed!
C: RUTH
D: Okay, sir. Okay. We’ll find your husband a bed.
N: He finishes up, just as Shirley McClaine did...
C: MIKE
D: Thank you...
S: INT. SLOAN KETTERING - PRIVATE ROOM - LATER
N: Kit lies on his side in a bed in what is clearly one of Sloan Kettering’s private luxury VIP suites, an IV in his arm. Mike sitting nearby, opening his laptop. As Ruth leaves...
C: KIT
D: So where's my toaster?
C: MIKE
D: Shut up.
C: KIT
D: I mean that was Oscar worthy. But I’m not your husband.
C: MIKE
D: They don’t know that.
N: They both smile...
C: KIT
D: You don’t have to wait with me.
C: MIKE
D: I have work to do.
C: KIT
D: Then go to work.
C: MIKE
E: off laptop
C: I am at work.
D: I worked too much. If I wasn’t at work, I was watching TV, which was work. And once I could watch TV anywhere, and break stories on my phone from anywhere, I was always at work. I’m sorry.
E: looking up at him closing his laptop
N: Mike reaches over and gently takes Kit’s camera, which is lying on the bed. He points it at Kit.
C: KIT
D: No cancer photos.
N: Kit rolls his eyes, while Mike looks at him through the lens.
C: MIKE
D: I promised your mother a photo.
C: KIT
D: What kind of backroom deal did you make with my mother at the supermarket? And why wasn't I consulted?
C: MIKE
D: That's between me and her. One photo. Please.
E: beat

D: Fine... If you must.
N: As Mike takes a photo...
S: EXT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT — DAY - MAR 2014

C: KIT
D: I'm fine.
C: MIKE
D: You sure?

D: What’s happening?
C: KIT
D: I’m having pain.
C: MIKE
D: Where?
N: In between labored breaths he manages to say...
C: KIT
D: Grab me a towel.
N: Mike rushes into the bathroom, grabs a towel, returns to the bed and places it over his soaking-wet body.
C: MIKE
D: Where does it hurt?
C: KIT
D: And the magazine...
N: Mike runs into the bathroom to grab the Dwell magazine, which has been rolled up some. He hands it to Kit, who grabs it and squeezes it tight. As it registers with Mike that he has been using the magazine as a pain stick...

N: It’s one of those rare days in early spring where New Yorkers are actually happy. Mike and Kit sit on a park bench, silently taking in the scene. Kit’s got his point-and-shoot and snaps a pic of a YOUNG COUPLE lying on a blanket.
C: MIKE
D: He was in the middle of his first round of chemo, and I was hoping it was half as hard on his tumor as it was on him.
E: V.O.
N: Then Kit leans over, puts his head between his legs, and vomits.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT’S WEST VILLAGE APT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT -
N: APR 2014 Kit heads into the living room to find Mike asleep, his laptop resting on his stomach. He gently picks it up and lays it on the coffee table, as Mike stirs...

D: But the old Kit still made appearances.
E: V.O.
C: MIKE
D: Hey, what time is it?
C: KIT
D: Ten. Go to bed.
N: Mike slowly sits up, Kit scratches his head. It turns out his hair is falling out. There are strands all over his hands.
C: KIT
D: Look!
E: CONT'D
N: Kit tugs at his hair now, pulling out a clump this time.
C: MIKE
D: Oh, my God!
N: He pulls out another clump. He grips his hair with both hands, makes a crazed face, and starts pulling fistfuls out.
C: MIKE
D: Don’t do that! Stop!
E: CONT'D
N: But Kit does it again — coming at Mike like a lunatic now, tearing out ever-larger clumps.
C: MIKE
D: Stop that! It’s getting everywhere!
E: CONT'D
N: Kit’s chasing Mike through the living room, both laughing, until Mike falls back onto the sofa, with Kit landing next to him. They lie there, looking at hair everywhere...
C: MIKE
D: Remember how you hated Mister Scooch for shedding?
E: CONT'D

C: NINA
D: Things straight men never say to each other.
C: MIKE
D: Good for you, Riley, standing up to him like that. I like you.
C: KIT
D: You made it all the way from his birthday party to the end of my chemo. You're a survivor, too.
N: Mike looks up and sees Todd heading towards them.
C: TODD
D: Hey.
N: There are looks all around as Todd sits down next to Kit. Mike tries not to look rattled.

D: I invited some people from work.
C: TODD
D: The others are coming.
N: Off Mike, clearly a little rattled.

S: INT. GYM — LOCKER ROOM — LATER
N: Mike, freshly showered, in just a towel, opens his locker, then looks over and sees the Hot Guy from the weight area. He makes sure Mike sees him enter the steam room. After a moment’s hesitation, Mike closes his locker.
S: INT. GYM — STEAM ROOM — LATER
N: Mike sits, a towel around his waist. As the steam thins a little, he sees the Hot Guy sitting across from him. The Hot Guy walks over and sits next to him. They sit there motionless for a moment. Mike starts to cry. Mike just sits there as the Hot Guy watches him cry...
C: HOT GUY

E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: At least my tumor has company.
C: DR. DAVIS
D: We’re going to stop chemo and take a short break in your treatment so you can get your strength back. Then we’ll start a course of radiation — five days a week.
C: MIKE
D: And that can work?
C: DR. DAVIS
D: It has proven effective in some cases. It could buy us some time.
C: KIT
D: I just want to live to see the end of Drag Race.
S: INT. SLOAN KETTERING - WAITING ROOM - NOV 2014
N: Kit walks out of his radiation appointment to find Mike waiting for him.
C: MIKE
D: Much to everyone's pleasant surprise, the radiation began to succeed where the chemo failed.

S: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET — LATER

D: Our little friend has been zapped into oblivion.
C: MARILYN
D: Oblivion?

C: MARILYN
D: Oh, my Lord, listen to the waves!

N: Mike sits in a lounge chair beside Marilyn, whose nose is in a NOVEL. Mike has a Diet Coke and his iPad. Bob’s asleep and Kit blows Super Miracle Bubbles through a plastic wand.

D: The gas station.
N: Kit picks up his camera and holds the lens right up against the bubble wand’s hole. He points the camera toward the sun and starts snapping away. Kit struggles trying to hold the bubble wand and the camera.
C: KIT
D: Mom, help me.
N: Both Mike and Marilyn look up, concerned.
C: MIKE
D: Are you alright?

C: KIT
D: A little to the right.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: There?

C: MIKE
D: That’s my leg. And now that's my...
E: beat
N: Mike’s expression slowly changes as he lets Kit continue. They slowly roll toward each other as Mike starts to reciprocate. They look into each other’s eyes as their shoulders begin to move up and down. They keep stroking each other as their breathing gets heavier and heavier... Until they both climax. After a long moment...
C: KIT
D: Too soon?
C: MIKE
D: Too messy. I’ll get a towel.
N: Mike gets up, then turns back to Kit.
C: MIKE
D: What was that?

C: MARILYN
D: Morning, how's he doing?
C: MIKE
D: Good... really good. He’s still sleeping.
C: MARILYN
D: How did you find this place?
C: MIKE
D: I’ve been here before. As a kid. It was the last family trip we took before my mother died.
N: Marilyn and Mike exchange a look.
C: MARILYN
D: Did the doctor really say he could have another five years?
N: Mike takes a moment, he wants to believe that so bad.
C: MIKE
D: They can't put a number on it but things are really looking good.
N: Marilyn breathes in the ocean air.
C: MARILYN
D: Thank you for inviting us to join you guys.
C: MIKE

D: You don't have to say that...

C: MIKE
D: I was actually vehemently against it.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN

D: Hi Dr. Davis. You’re on speaker.
E: CONT'D
C: KIT

E: O.C.
C: MIKE
D: How big are they?
C: DR. DAVIS
D: They’re fairly tiny, but there are a lot of them. And your primary tumor is growing again.
E: O.C.
C: KIT
D: What are we looking at here, Doctor? Six weeks? Six months?
E: stoic
C: DR. DAVIS
D: More than six weeks. Six months...? Probably not.
E: O.C.
C: KIT
D: But, I’ve been feeling so much better.
C: DR. DAVIS
D: The radiation won you some time. But at this point all we can really do is address your symptoms and... manage your pain.
N: Mike starts to cry.
C: KIT
D: Thank you for letting us know, doctor.
N: Mike ends the call. Kit remains silent. Mike puts his arms around him.
C: MIKE
D: I hate her so much.
N: Suddenly, Mike lets go of Kit and snaps open his lap top. Mike starts typing feverishly.
C: KIT
D: What are you doing?
C: MIKE
D: I read about a targeted treatment for NETs being developed in Germany. It’s called...

D: We can’t give up just because the Grim Reaper told us to. I’m not ready.

E: CONT'D
S: EXT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - DECK - LATER
N: Mike climbs out of the window balancing a glass of wine in his hand. Kit’s already there, lying on his side, packing a bowl, with Mister Scooch curled up next to him. Mike takes a seat on the deck and observes Kit for a moment.

C: KIT
D: No. I’m not. I’m scared of what the end looks like, but not of dying. Please don't let me die in a hospital.

C: KIT
D: Promise. I want to die at home.
E: CONT'D beat

D: Mister Scooch, did you hear him promise, yet?
E: CONT’D playfully
C: MIKE
D: I promise.
C: KIT
D: Mister Scooch and I thank you.
N: Mike takes a sip of wine. He’s enjoying the family moment.
C: MIKE
D: Had you not approached me that night I don’t think we ever would’ve met.
C: KIT
D: You were so lost. It was adorable.
C: MIKE
D: You were so out of my league.
C: KIT
D: I just wanted to take you home and fuck you.
C: MIKE
D: I needed to be fucked. But I was afraid if you saw me naked you’d cut and run. So I seduced you with my sparkling wit first.
E: beat
C: KIT
D: Considering your shtick is way scarier than your body that was a risky bet.
N: Mike chuckles.
C: MIKE
D: I’m sorry, Kit.
C: KIT
D: For what?
C: MIKE
D: For blaming you for... everything. For not owning my role in all of it. My body issues. My fear of loss.
C: KIT
D: The Smurfs...
C: MIKE
D: The Smurfs...
E: nods
C: KIT
D: Your questionable sense of style...

D: Nope. Not ready to have this conversation with you...
E: interrupts, fighting back tears
C: KIT
D: All I am saying is if you meet someone...
C: MIKE
D: Got it. Message received. Thank you. Come again.
E: abruptly
N: Kit chuckles. Mike takes a sip of wine. They sit there silently.

D: You know what? I think I’m ready to try some of this pot you’ve spoken so highly of.
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: Really?
E: thrown
C: MIKE
D: Yep. It’s time.
C: KIT
D: Get over here.

D: OK, so first thing’s first...
E: CONT’D

C: KIT
D: It goes this way.
E: CONT’D
C: MIKE
D: I see it now. Makes sense.
E: nods
C: KIT
D: Now light the other end with the lighter, and then inhale slowly. Don’t exhale right away. Let it sit in your lungs for a few seconds.
N: Mike struggles with the lighter and hands it to Kit.
C: MIKE
D: I can’t do it.
C: KIT
D: Yes you can.
N: Mike nods, then tries again. Nada. Once more. Finally, a spark. Mike quickly holds the flame to the pot and takes a very quick hit. He’s proud of himself.
C: KIT
D: That wasn’t a very long hit. You might not feel anything...
E: CONT’D
C: MIKE
D: My throat is burning.
E: interrupts, panicked
C: KIT

C: KIT
D: Better?
C: MIKE
D: Yes. But I’m not feeling anything.
C: KIT
D: Take another hit. And this time, hold it in for a few seconds.
N: Mike takes another hit, holds it, exhales, doesn’t cough. He lies down beside Kit and looks up. His eyes trace the branches of the tree hugging their deck.
C: MIKE
D: I think I’m feeling it.
C: KIT
D: Welcome to the Stoners Club.
N: A super relaxed Mike falls into Kit's arms and they hold each other tightly.

E: thrown beat
C: MIKE
D: I mean it.
C: KIT
D: You're only asking me because I'm dying.
C: MIKE
D: It's more than that. You know, I thought I was scared of marriage. But I think it was divorce that terrified me. I was so afraid of our relationship being deemed a failure that it didn't seem like a risk worth taking. Why rock the boat. So I pretended like it didn't mean anything. But it does. I love you. I want to be your husband. And I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me, Kit Cowan?
E: beat
N: Kit is profoundly moved by the proposal.

C: KIT
D: Wait a second.
E: wheels turning, interrupts

Mike, Kit, Nick, and Nina are blocked by an officious twenty- something PRODUCTION ASSISTANT with a walkie-talkie.
C: KIT
D: We have to get in there now!
C: PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
D: It’ll just be a few minutes.
N: They wait impatiently till Mike realizes they’re not rolling.
C: MIKE
D: This is bullshit-- they’re not even rolling! Let’s go!
N: They push past the Production Assistant, through the crew, and up the steps.
C: PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
D: Hey! Stop! Jesus!
S: INT. 60 CENTER STREET - MOMENTS LATER
N: They all empty their pockets into trays and go through the metal detector. Nina puts the toaster on a tray, which of course sets off the machine...
C: NINA
D: Sorry! It's just a toaster!
S: INT. 60 CENTER STREET - JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - LATER
N: They rush in, cupcakes and toaster in tow. The JUDGE’S CLERK, a schlumpy, slow-moving bureaucrat, doesn’t even look at them.
C: SCHLUMPY CLERK
D: The judge is done for the day.
C: KIT
D: We have extenuating circumstances!
C: SCHLUMPY CLERK
D: Do you? What are they?
C: KIT
D: Just look at me. I’m obviously dying. We have to get married today.
C: SCHLUMPY CLERK
D: I’ll see what I can do.
E: finally looking up
N: The Schlumpy Clerk disappears into the judges chambers.
S: INT. 60 CENTER STREET - JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER
N: They stand waiting.
C: MIKE
D: We only have twenty-five minutes.
C: NICK
D: You had thirteen years.
C: NINA
D: I’m glad you two finally came to your senses.
C: KIT
D: I’d like a cupcake.
C: NINA
D: No! It’s bad luck to eat wedding cake before the wedding!
C: KIT
D: Nina, how much worse can it get?
N: As Kit bites into a cupcake the Schlumpy Clerk trots back into the room, winded, and hands them the waiver.
C: SCHLUMPY CLERK
D: You’re all set. All the best.
N: Kit takes the toaster from Nina.
C: KIT
D: Thank you. So much. This is for you.
N: Kit slides the toaster over to him. As they rush off...
C: SCHLUMPY CLERK
D: I can't accept gifts!
S: EXT. 60 CENTER STREET - TOP OF THE STEPS - LATER
N: On the way out they encounter the same Production Assistant.
C: PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
D: We’re rolling. You’re going to have to wait here.
C: KIT
D: Do you know who this is? If you want a future in television, you’ll let us pass. He's a big deal.
C: MIKE
D: He's not wrong.
C: NINA
D: Look, asshole. This is my best friend and all he wants to do is marry his boyfriend here, who actually is a big deal--
E: off Kit
C: MIKE
D: Thank you.
C: NINA
D: He turned out to be one of the most amazing people I've ever known. They don't have a lot of time. So I don't care what stupid show you're making--
C: MIKE
D: It's actually a great show.
C: NINA
D: The marriage office closes in ten minutes. Please let us through.
N: The Production Assistant looks from Mike and Kit to the ACTORS.
C: PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
D: Go. Now. Hurry up.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Action!
E: O.C.
C: PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
D: Shit.
N: It's too late. Mike, Kit, Nina and Nick are rushing past MARISKA HARGITAY, who's standing on her mark.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Cut! You’ve got to be kidding me! Re-set!
E: O.C.
C: MIKE
D: Hey, Mariska!
C: MARISKA
D: Mike! Hi!
C: MIKE
D: Mariska! Sorry for fucking up your shot!
C: KIT
D: I told you he was a big deal!
E: yelling back to PA
N: As the four of them hurry down the steps...
S: INT. CITY HALL - WEDDING CHAPEL - LATER
N: Mike and Kit hold hands in front of a very jaded looking OFFICIANT. Nina and Nick are taking pictures.
C: OFFICIANT
D: Do you have rings?
N: Kit sets the two spider rings on the podium. The Officiant does a double take, and then starts reading off a piece of paper.
C: OFFICIANT
D: Do you, Christopher, solemnly declare Michael to be your husband?
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: I do.
C: OFFICIANT
D: Do you promise to love, honor, and keep him for as long as you both shall live?
C: MIKE
D: I had forgotten about that part.
E: V.O.
C: KIT
D: I do.
N: Nina cries as Mike and Kit try to maintain their composure.
C: OFFICIANT
D: You can place... that ring... on his finger.
N: Kit slides a spider ring onto Mike’s finger.
C: OFFICIANT
D: Do you, Michael, solemnly declare Christopher to be your husband?
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: I do.
C: OFFICIANT
D: Do you promise to love, honor, and keep him for as long as you both shall live?
C: MIKE
D: There it was again.
E: V.O.
C: MIKE
D: I do.
N: Mike slides the other spider ring onto Kit’s finger. Now Nick starts to cry.
C: OFFICIANT
D: By the powers vested in me by the great state of New York, I now pronounce you married. You may seal your vows with a kiss.
N: Mike and Kit lean in and kiss...
C: KIT
D: I wrote down some vows.
C: MIKE
D: You did? When? I didn’t.
C: KIT
D: It’s alright, Mike, these can be for both of us.
N: Kit grabs his iPad from Nina and fires it up.
C: KIT
E: CONT'D reading from the iPad
C: I knew immediately that...
D: Here. I can’t do it. You read them.
E: his voice cracks
N: Mike takes the iPad from him, takes a breath, and reads...
C: MIKE
D: I knew immediately after we met that you were the one. The last thirteen years haven’t always been easy, but we always find our way. I love you. I love us. We are in this together and now it’s official. Nothing can say what you mean to me. You are my best friend and I can’t imagine my life without you.
N: Mike rests the iPad on the podium and they wrap their arms around each other.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S APARTMENT - DAY - LATER
N: Kit’s asleep, his head is on Mike’s shoulder. Mike’s eating the last cupcake. Mike's phone buzzes.
C: MIKE
D: Hi, Marilyn...
E: picking up
N: Mike gently wakes up Kit.
C: MIKE
D: It’s your mom.
E: CONT'D
C: KIT
D: Hey, Mom. We have news... and this time it’s good...
E: taking the phone
C: MIKE
D: We were holding out for just one more Christmas...
E: V.O.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - EVENING - DEC 2014
N: Kit, thinner than ever, takes seemingly forever to hang a round BABY BLUE ORNAMENT on an aluminum Christmas tree. Nestled next to the bulb is a BABY SMURF. Marilyn tries to hold back tears as Kit almost stumbles placing another bulb. Mike, meanwhile, looks like he hasn't slept in a month.
C: KIT
D: I’m almost done.
C: MIKE
D: It’s beautiful, Kit. Thank you.
N: Kit smiles, proud of his work.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT’S WEST VILLAGE APT - JAN 2015
N: Marilyn sits, covering her ears, as two PARAMEDICS carry Kit out of the apartment on a chair stretcher, which has forced Kit to sit up. He’s wild with pain, completely delirious. He's grabbing on to the rolled up Dwell magazine/pain stick for dear life.
C: MIKE
D: He needs a stretcher! He can’t sit! He has a tumor in his ass! You’re hurting him!
C: PARAMEDIC
D: Sir, the stretcher can’t make it up this stairwell.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT’S WEST VILLAGE APT - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
N: NEIGHBORS are coming into the hallway. Kit grabs and tears at Mike’s shirt.
C: KIT
D: Why are you doing this to me?!? Make them stop! Make them stop!
N: Suddenly, out of Kit's hands falls the Dwell magazine/pain stick. Mike quickly picks it up and is shocked at what he finds. The magazine is so tightly rolled up from nearly a year of Kit gripping it in pain that it doesn't even resemble a magazine. It's like a weapon. It's in that moment that Mike realizes he is holding in his hands physical manifestation of Kit's prolonged suffering and it's a gut punch. As he holds it listening to Kit's screams we...
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING - JAN 2015
N: Kit’s sound asleep. Mike sits at the end of the bed, rubbing Kit’s feet. Mike looks like a wreck. Marilyn pulls him aside.
C: MARILYN
D: How are you?
C: MIKE
D: Better now.
C: MIKE
D: He can't stay here.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: This is the best place for him.
C: MIKE
D: I promised him I wouldn't let him... He's not dying in a hospital.
E: fighting back tears
N: Marilyn lays her hand on Mike's shoulder as they both take in Kit.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NEXT MORNING - JAN 2015
N: Mike is sitting next to Kit's bed when Todd appears at the door. Mike, clearly expecting him, gently wakes Kit.
C: MIKE
D: Special visitor alert.
N: Kit opens his eyes. A smile spreads across his face when he sees Todd.
C: MIKE
D: He’s good for only a couple of minutes at a time.
E: CONT'D
N: Todd nods... And Mike leaves, closing the door behind him.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING AREA - LATER
N: Mike sits with Marilyn and Bob. As Mike watches the door to Kit’s room. Nick and Nina walk over from the elevator.
C: NINA
D: How’s he doing?
C: MIKE
D: Well enough to have visitors. Now I just have to get him home. I promised.
E: then
N: Just then Todd comes out of Kit’s room. He’s clearly been crying. Nick and Mike exchange a look, before Mike walks over to him.
C: TODD
D: Thank you for letting me see him. Kit’s an amazing person and you’re an amazing husband. I’m so sorry this is happening... I'm sorry for everything.
E: silence, then
N: Todd starts for the elevator, as Mike watches him go...
C: MIKE
D: Todd...
N: Todd stops. Mike walks over and pulls him into an embrace. As they hold each other, both men are sobbing now...
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT — LIVING ROOM — JAN 2015
N: Kit, with his morphine pump, sits with pillows propping him up. Mike plugs their old, seldom-used DVD player into the back of the television set.
C: MIKE
D: I called in every last favor.
C: KIT
D: What is it?
N: Mike turns and faces Kit, holding up a DVD, pleased and triumphant.
C: MIKE
D: The Drag Race season finale.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT - LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Kit lies on his side, his head against Mike’s shoulder, trying to find a comfortable position as the credits play.
C: RUPAUL
D: You are all winners. You are all stars. But only one can be the next drag superstar.
N: As we watch the show A DRAG QUEEN walks into the room and sits on the arm of the sofa next to Mike. She gently drapes a comforting arm around his shoulder. A SECOND DRAG QUEEN walks in and sits next to Kit, resting a hand on his leg. Neither Mike nor Kit notices their presence. A THIRD DRAG QUEEN, the most glamorous of the three, comes behind the sofa and places a bejeweled hand on Mike’s shoulder. He looks up. They lock eyes. She nods to the TV, then Mike turns his attention back to the show.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT'S WEST VILLAGE APT — BEDROOM — FEB 2015
N: Mike, Marilyn, and Bob are sitting with Kit, his breathing incredibly labored.
C: MIKE
D: Can I have a moment alone with him?
N: Marilyn hesitates, unsure if she’s even capable of letting go of Kit’s hand. Bob takes Marilyn shoulders and gently helps her stand. As they leave the room and close the door behind them, Mike climbs into bed with Kit and stares at him. He grabs the collar of his sweatshirt, and pulls him closer.
C: MIKE
D: You listen to me: I’m gonna be OK. It’s going to be unbelievably hard, but I’m going to be OK. You go get heaven ready for us because thanks to you I have high standards. Thank you for giving me a family. Thank you for loving me.
E: CONT'D
N: Mike realizes he’s still holding him up by his sweatshirt and gently lays him down on the bed again. Kit, his eyes barely open, ever so slowly moves his hand toward Mike’s and squeezes it. Mike squeezes back, as tears fall from his eyes.
S: INT. MIKE AND KIT’S WEST VILLAGE APT — LIVING ROOM — LATER
N: Mike walks out of the bedroom, looks at Marilyn and Bob.
C: MIKE
D: Thank you.
N: Marilyn heads back toward the bedroom, followed by Bob. Mike stands at the door, takes a deep breath... As the camera pulls back and takes in the window, and pushes out onto the roof, and further out into the noise and life of New York City, farther and farther back, as if Kit’s spirit has finally been set free.
S: EXT. MILLERSBURG RIVER - DOCK - DAY - MAY 2015
N: Mike, Marilyn and Bob are standing on a dock. They’re pouring Kit’s ashes into the river...
S: EXT. KIT’S CHILDHOOD HOME - PORCH - LATER
N: Mike walks out and joins Bob, who is sitting in a rocking chair reading the local paper.
C: MIKE
D: Big goings-on in Millersburg?
C: BOB
D: A raccoon snuck into the Dollar Store and destroyed the place. It took a dozen cops to catch the little bugger.
C: MIKE
D: Marilyn's been at the supermarket for a while.
E: looks at watch
N: Long, slightly awkward silence. Bob folds the newspaper up and places it on the ground next to the rocking chair.
C: BOB
D: She's having a difficult time. Everything's a painful reminder. She can't send emails anymore because it reminds her of emailing with Kit. She avoids driving down Pine street because she can't bear to look at Sorrento's. She sees you and...
E: beat
N: As Bob fights back tears, Mike connects the dots. He looks at the empty chair next to Bob and the heartbreaking reality hits him: Marilyn can't bear to be around him. As Mike quietly swallows that bitter pill...
C: BOB
D: She's just gonna need some time.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. MILLERSBURG RIVER — LATER
N: Mike pulls over alongside the river and gets out of his car. He sees Marilyn sitting on a bench, alone, staring out at the river. He slowly approaches and stands beside her. Marilyn is crying.
C: MARILYN
D: I'm sorry.
N: Mike, hurt, takes her in, then gently says.
C: MIKE
D: Before I leave, I have a favor to ask. I would very much like a hug. It can be a quick.
E: beat
N: A teary Marilyn rises and faces Mike. They embrace, triggering a wave of emotion in Mike.
C: MIKE
D: Thank you for Kit.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: No. Thank you.
S: INT. KIT’S BROOKLYN APT - DAY - MAY 2015
N: Mike’s cleaning out Kit’s apartment with Nick, Riley and Nina. The place is already half empty.
C: NINA
D: Kit was my third boyfriend who came out in college. I had this magical effect on boys.
C: NICK
D: There are some guys at my gym I’d like you to meet. Kidding.
E: off Riley
C: RILEY
D: You wouldn't last a day without me. What’s in here?
E: picking up a box
N: Mike, Nick and Nina exchange a look.
C: NICK
D: What are you going to do with those?
S: EXT. GOODWILL - LATER
N: Mike and Nina are dropping the last bags into the donation area. GOODWILL WORKERS are going through everything. Mike runs back to the car and gets Kit’s box of sex toys.
C: MIKE
D: Start the getaway car.
N: Mike runs back to the donation table, sets the box down, then hurries back to the car along with Nina. They hop back in, laughing, as Nina pulls away.
C: MIKE
D: The thing about endings... it’s never really the end.
E: V.O.
S: INT. HUDSON, NEW YORK — STORE - NIGHT — DEC 2045
N: Mike, who has aged beautifully, sits behind the counter. Surrounding him is a mix of mid-century designer furniture and Smurf collectables. Mike hands a small bag and some change over to a young GAY MAN and his HUSBAND.
C: MIKE
D: Enjoy. Happy Holidays.
C: GAY MAN
D: Does that sofa really sell for ten thousand dollars?
C: MIKE
D: Yep. It’s a Finn Juhl.
C: HUSBAND
D: That Smurf, holding a red apple inscribed with “I love NY... ,” how much is that?
C: KIT
D: Only a hundred of those were made.
E: O.C.
N: We see a beautifully-aged Kit standing at the entrance of the store, having just walked in from outside...
C: KIT
D: It’s actually not for sale. It’s part of my husband’s private collection.
E: CONT'D
N: Mike smiles, it’s nice to hear the Smurf Expert side of Kit. As the couple starts to leave, Kit turns to Mike...
C: KIT
D: It's snowing.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. HUDSON, NEW YORK - STORE - LATER
N: Mike steps outside in an oversized jacket. It’s not only snowing, it’s snowing in a picture perfect small town. He turns to admire their quaint row house, taking in the gorgeous store window. He looks up at their six-over-six sash windows on the second and third floor... Suddenly all six windows on both floors simultaneously light up with multicolored C9 old-timey bulbs, all diligently measured out for peak symmetry. It’s magical. Just then Kit comes outside with their rambunctious GOLDEN RETRIEVER, who bounds toward Mike.
C: MIKE
D: Jibber Jabs!
N: Mike takes the leash from Kit and manages to put it on the dog. They make their way down the street, hand-in-hand. Mike stops for a moment as Kit walks on ahead... Mike stands all alone now, watching, as Kit slowly disappears into the snow.
S: EXT. SKY - JUNE 2015
N: A bright blue sky empty, save for a PLANE that slowly enters the bottom of the frame, arching upwards...
S: EXT. PIER - SAME
N: Close on Mike watching, as the plane moves across the sky.
C: KIT
D: I asked myself where are we going? Wondered if our tickets are for the same destination. On the same flight? Have your seat belt securely fastened...
E: V.O.
N: Mike lies back as the SUN pours down on him.
C: KIT
D: There may be unexpected turbulence... If I’m scared, I’ll know you’re in the seat next to me... Holding my hand... Telling me we’re going to be okay.
E: V.O.
N: As we pull away we see Mike’s walking down the Santa Monica pier. We see him take his shirt off mid-stroll. The camera pulls back farther and takes in LA... THE END
