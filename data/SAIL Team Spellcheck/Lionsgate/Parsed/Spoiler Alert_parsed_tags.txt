D:           I picked it up again as a way to

D:           So... you're probably wondering
D:           about the breakup. It happened a
D:           few weeks before Atlantic City, but
D:           the trip was already planned and
D:           invitations had gone out and we
D:           didn't want to turn a birthday
D:           celebration into a pity party. So
D:           we waited and told everyone the
D:           following week.
