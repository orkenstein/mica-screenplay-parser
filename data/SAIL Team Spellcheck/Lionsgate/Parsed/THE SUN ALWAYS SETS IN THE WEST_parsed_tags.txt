0: T: FADE IN:
0: 
N: A dusty West Texas desert. The sun has just dipped below
N: the horizon. Dark blue spreads across the rugged
N: mountains, the scrub brush, the dirt, giving it all the
N: hue of a corpse.
0: 
N: A GREY HORSE trots through the gloom.
0: 
N: Atop it, MARTIN TALBOT (50s), his seductively handsome
N: face creased with wear, his eyes alert, but weary. He
N: dons the leather hat and brown coat of a rancher.
0: 
N: Riding with hands on his hips is RUBY (8). Solemn, aged
N: beyond her years. Her blue, dirt-stained dress tells us
N: she’s no stranger to labor in this unforgiving land.
0: 
N: The pair approaches...
0: 
N: ROCK SPRINGS. A bleak, dying town. 1910s. Last gasp of
N: the old west.
0: 
N: An OIL DERRICK stands over the town, shuttered and quiet.
0: 
S: EXT. ROCK SPRINGS - MAIN STREET - NIGHT
0: 
N: Martin and Ruby CLIP-CLOP past a wooden arch that reads
N: “Rock Springs -- Warm Beds, Full Bellies, Bright Future”
0: 
N: The town is not as advertised.
0: 
N: Once bustling, it’s mostly boarded up storefronts. Fancy
N: dresses gather dust through one window. A barber’s pole
N: hangs crooked at another abandoned shop. Only THE PLAYFUL
N: PUSSYCAT, a saloon and brothel, attracts business.
0: 
N: Martin narrows his eyes at the SEEDY CLIENTELE who gawk
N: right back at him and Ruby. They’re curiosities here.
0: 
N: The duo comes to a halt at
0: 
N: FIRST CHRIST CHURCH, a squat white building with a large
N: cross jutting toward the heavens. A marquee in the front:
N: “All are welcome.”
0: 
S: INT. FIRST CHRIST CHURCH - SAME
0: 
N: PASTOR NATHAN (60s) kneels on the hard floor before the
N: crucifix. Ruby cautiously approaches him.
0: 0:                                                             2.
0: 
0: 
N: As she grow closer, she sees that he holds a dust broom
N: in his hand. He’s not praying...he’s angling in on a FAT
N: MOUSE boldly chewing on the lectern.
0: 
N: WHACK. Pastor Nathan kills the mouse. Ruby jumps, which
N: alerts him to her presence.
0: 
C:                          PASTOR NATHAN
D:           Ruby, hello.
0: 
N: They both eye the dead rodent.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           One mustn’t let them gain purchase, lest
D:           you tempt an infestation.
0: 
N: As he sweeps the mouse into a sack, we get a good look at
N: him. Thin and bespectacled, white collar against a coarse
N: black coat hanging from his slight frame.
0: 
C:                        RUBY
D:           We need you. For mama.
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan darkens.
0: 
C:                          PASTOR NATHAN
D:           Already?
0: 
C:                        MARTIN (O.S.)
D:           It got bad fast.
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan is startled by the low voice. He turns to
N: see Martin standing in the doorway. They lock eyes. No
N: love lost between them.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           I’ll get my things.
0: 
S: EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan, on his horse, struggles to keep up with
N: Martin and Ruby. True darkness has fallen on the land
N: now. Only the moon’s glow lights the way toward a
0: 
N: SQUAT RANCH HOUSE. We’ll call it PEARL’S HOUSE.
0: 
N: The ranch is centered on a rolling plain before a humble
N: stretch of crops. A simple homestead farm.
0: 
N: The utilitarian structure is flanked by a rickety barn on
N: one side, a rocky outcropping of hills on the other, a
N: dingy outhouse behind.
0: 0:                                                             3.
0: 
0: 
N: They dismount. Martin and Ruby head right for the house,
N: but Pastor Nathan stops at a PIGPEN. A handful of
N: sleeping pigs...puncture marks along their jowls...
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan gazes at the wounds. Curious.
0: 
S: INT. PEARL’S HOUSE - LATER
0: 
N: Martin enters through the front door into the
0: 
N: MAIN ROOM, an all-purpose kitchen/living room. Hard
N: wooden chairs, pots and pans strewn on the walls, simple
N: toys on the floor, fireplace. Desert plains living.
0: 
N: He walks down a short hall. To the left, RUBY’S ROOM, to
N: the right
0: 
N: PEARL’S BEDROOM, just a dresser and a bed.
0: 
N: PEARL LOGAN (40s) lies in it. Her arms are palsied, hands
N: uncontrollably balled. She has ALS, but they don’t know
N: what that is. All they know is her once-proud face is
N: emaciated and her breaths are coming in death rattles.
0: 
N: Martin moves to her side. She tries to look at him, but
N: can only move her eyes. She’s in hell.
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan is stricken by the sight of Pearl. He
N: glances at Martin with accusatory eyes.
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan takes Pearl’s balled fist in his hand.
N: Squeezes it. WHISPERS to her something we can’t hear.
0: 
N: Martin narrows his eyes. Pastor Nathan feels his glare.
N: Gets down to work. As he pulls out his cross, Martin
N: discreetly moves out of his way.
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan raises the cross over Pearl.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           Oh holy hosts above, I call upon thee as
D:           a servant of Jesus Christ...
0: 
S: INT. PEARL’S HOUSE - MAIN ROOM - LATER
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan gathers his coat and hat while Martin
N: stands impassively. Ruby sits in a corner, sniffling.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           Will she be buried at the church?
0: 
C:                        MARTIN
D:           No.
0: 0:                                                            4.
0: 
0: 
N: Martin and the Pastor share an uncomfortable silence.
0: 
C:                        MARTIN
D:           I’ll get your money.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           There’s no need for payment. Pearl and I-
0: 
C:                        MARTIN
D:           I’ll get your money.
0: 
N: Martin moves to the HALLWAY, entering
0: 
N: PEARL’S BEDROOM
0: 
N: Rattles open a tin. Atop a pile of bills, a photo of
N: Martin with a WOMAN and LITTLE GIRL. Not Pearl and Ruby.
0: 
N: IN THE MAIN ROOM
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan turns to Ruby.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           After your papa passed, your mother and I
D:           grew quite close. She found great solace
D:           at the church, before...
0: 
N: He casts a quick glance toward Martin, occupied in the
N: other room. Pastor Nathan leans in close to Ruby.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           Is he treating you right?
0: 
N: He reaches out a hand to touch Ruby’s shoulder --
0: 
N: -- SNATCH. Martin GRIPS Pastor Nathan’s wrist, appearing
N: at his side FASTER THAN HUMANLY POSSIBLE.
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan is UNNERVED. Martin bears down on the holy
N: man...and then forces a few bills into his hand.
0: 
N: He releases his grip. Pastor Nathan rubs his wrist.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
C:           A generous donation.
E:                  (buttoning coat to leave)
D:           Will we be seeing you and Ruby at service?
0: 
C:                        MARTIN
D:           Probably not.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           The good word is for all. Even you.
0: 0:                                                            5.
0: 
0: 
C:                        MARTIN
D:           Pearl wanted her last rites. You’ve done
D:           your job, Pastor.
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan glances at Ruby. Can’t let it go.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           Ruby will need guidance now tha-
0: 
C:                        MARTIN
D:           She’ll be fine.
0: 
N: Martin stares Pastor Nathan down. He’s had enough. But
N: Pastor Nathan has caught the scent of something wicked.
N: Summoning all of his strength, he doesn’t look away.
0: 
N: Instead, his trembling hand reaches into his pocket and
N: pulls out a BIBLE. He extends it toward Martin.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           For Ruby.
0: 
N: Martin stares at the Bible. A LOW GROWL emits from
N: Martin’s chest. It’s barely audible, but for Pastor
N: Nathan, it’s CONFIRMATION OF THE UNHOLY.
0: 
N: The stalemate is broken by Pearl COUGHING spasmodically.
N: Pastor Nathan places the bible on the kitchen table.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           I must be going.
0: 
S: EXT. PEARL’S HOUSE - PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan scampers away atop his horse as though
N: chased by the Headless Horseman.
0: 
N: Martin watches his hasty retreat from the doorway. Ruby
N: joins him. Sees Martin’s hard face.
0: 
C:                        RUBY
D:           Why don’t you like Pastor Nathan?
0: 
C:                        MARTIN
D:           He thinks I stole something of his.
0: 
S: INT. PEARL’S HOUSE - RUBY’S ROOM - LATER
0: 
N: Ruby sleeps in her bed beneath thick blankets, a
N: flickering candle on her nightstand.
0: 0:                                                             6.

0: 
S: INT. PEARL’S HOUSE - PEARL’S BEDROOM - LATER
0: 
N: Martin sits beside Pearl, a heaviness upon him. Pearl
N: looks at him, beseeching.
0: 
C:                        MARTIN
D:           Are you sure you want to do this?
0: 
N: She opens her mouth to respond, but only drool comes out.
0: 
N: Martin knows what she wants. He lowers his head...and
N: produces a KNIFE from his pocket.
0: 
N: He SLICES his palm. Blood drips from the wound.
0: 
S: INT. PEARL’S HOUSE - RUBY’S BEDROOM - LATER
0: 
N: A FIGURE stands in the doorway. As she moves toward the
N: candlelight, we see that it’s PEARL, COMPLETELY HEALTHY.
0: 
N: She leans over the sleeping Ruby and kisses her forehead.
N: Ruby groggily awakens.
0: 
C:                        RUBY
D:           Mama...?
0: 
C:                        PEARL
D:           This is how I want you to remember me,
D:           sweetheart.
0: 
N: Pearl touches the half-asleep Ruby lovingly.
0: 
C:                        RUBY
D:           You’re so cold...
0: 
N: Pearl flashes a bittersweet smile.
0: 
C:                        PEARL
D:           Don’t worry about that. I love you. And I
D:           always will. Now go back to sleep.
0: 
N: She may remember this as a dream, but right now Ruby has
N: a smile on her face as Pearl blows out the candle.
0: 
S: EXT. PEARL’S HOUSE - LATER
0: 
N: Pearl stands in the crisp night, taking a deep breath.
N: Her senses are alive.
0: 
C:                        PEARL
D:           I can smell the honeysuckles down in the
D:           valley. I can hear the field mice hearts
D:           roaring like a train.

0: 
0: 
N: Martin watches her from beneath the brim of his hat.
0: 
C:                        PEARL
D:           It’s like this for you all the time?
0: 
N: Martin nods. The moment bittersweet.
0: 
N: A PANG in Pearl’s stomach, and she doubles over. Martin
N: comes to her side, holding her.
0: 
N: Pearl moans at the spreading pain, deeper than hunger.
N: She gazes at Martin. A new understanding of him.
0: 
N: Martin looks to the pigs, but Pearl takes his head in her
N: hands, bringing them face to face.
0: 
C:                        PEARL
D:           It’s His plan I go to Him tonight. I’m
D:           already running late.
0: 
N: Martin lowers his head.
0: 
S: EXT. PEARL’S HOUSE - BARN - LATER
0: 
N: Pearl writhes in the hay. Martin gazes down at her.
0: 
C:                        PEARL
D:           Please...it’s starting...
0: 
N: Martin is frozen. Pearl looks up to him. Sees his
N: indecision. Tries to allay his fears.
0: 
C:                        PEARL
D:           I know you’ll take good care of her...
0: 
N: They lock eyes. Even as she convulses, a tenderness.
0: 
C:                        PEARL
D:           ...such beautiful eyes...
0: 
N: Pearl curls in a ball. Martin takes a deep breath...
0: 
N: ...and grips the AXE resting at his feet. He’s about to
N: raise it, but can’t quite bring himself...
0: 
N: AN INHUMAN SHRIEK!
0: 
N: Pearl turns her head to reveal DEEP ORANGE EYES, her
N: SNAPPING MOUTH revealing GROWING FANGS. Her arms and legs
N: wriggle like a newborn’s.
0: 
N: Martin lifts the axe. Brings it down on Pearl’s neck.
0: 
N: THUNK.
0: 0:                                                             8.

S: INT. DMITRI COYNE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
0: 
N: The end of a silver-plattered dinner for Rock Springs’
N: leaders: E.B. TROTT (60s), the town’s portly banker; JACK
N: HASTINGS (50s), a beaten-down sheriff; DAVE MCDONOUGH
N: (40s), the decent general store owner; and PASTOR NATHAN.
0: 
N: At the head of the table is DMITRI COYNE (40s). A rich
N: oil man, waxed mustache, vest and pocket watch. He
N: watches as ABBY, a YOUNG SERVANT, clears the dishes.
0: 
C:                        DMITRI
D:           Wonderful, just top notch.
E:                  (to his company)
D:           Gentleman, I’d like nothing more than to
D:           retire to the library for some Kentucky
D:           Cheroots, but we have business yet to
D:           discuss. Abby, the map?
0: 
N: Abby sets up an easel with a GEOLOGIC MAP of ROCK SPRINGS
N: on it. “Property of Allied Oil” at the top. Tension.
0: 
C:                        DMITRI
D:           As you know, Allied Oil has enjoyed a
D:           complementary relationship with Rock
D:           Springs for quite some time. But that
D:           time, unfortunately, is ending.
0: 
N: Dmitri turns to the map, marking X’s with his pencil.
0: 
C:                        DMITRI
D:           Our initial drill site here has run dry,
D:           and surveys here, here, and here have
D:           been fruitless. As a result, Allied Oil
D:           will be leaving Rock Springs at the end
D:           of the month.
0: 
N: The town council exchanges worried looks.

0: 
C:                         DMITRI
D:           But I speak for the president of Allied
D:           Oil, Mr. William P. Conover himself, in
D:           extending our most heartfelt thanks for
D:           the years of prosperity we shared.
E:                  (beat)
D:           Now, can I tempt anyone with some pie?
0: 
C:                        MCDONOUGH
D:           So that’s it? You squeeze us dry and then
D:           just move along to the next town?
0: 
C:                        DMITRI
D:           We provided fair wages for a fair day’s
D:           work. We didn’t promise eternity.
0: 
C:                        MCDONOUGH
D:           If you leave, the railroad will stop
D:           coming. The town will die, sir.

N: Pastor Nathan studies the map as E.B. rises.
0: 
C:                        E.B. TROTT
D:           You sat us down right here and told us
D:           that first deposit was just the
D:           beginning. Now I got dozens of loans that
D:           are gonna default if those people can’t
D:           keep working.
E:                  (to the other members)
D:           If banks go, civilization goes with them.
0: 
C:                        SHERIFF HASTINGS
D:           And I don’t have the resources to control
D:           a town of desperate men. As bad as things
D:           are now, they’re about to get worse.
0: 
C:                        DMITRI
D:           I understand your concerns, but Allied
D:           Oil is not in the habit of losing money.
D:           If I can’t present them with sound
D:           investments, they will fire me and find
D:           someone who can.

D:           What about there?
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan points at the map. He stands, still
N: pointing, and walks until his pointer finger touches the
N: one area on the map not marked off with X’s.
0: 
C:                        DMITRI
D:           A promising site. Unfortunately, private

C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           A squatter. He has no claim to that land.

D:           Could there really be oil up there?
0: 
C:                        DMITRI
D:           According to our scouts, yes. But
D:           frankly, for Allied Oil, it wouldn’t be
D:           worth the financial or legal trouble to
D:           contend with hostile squatters.

0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           Were you not just lamenting the departure
D:           of our oil brethren? He has no right to
D:           that land. Isn’t that right, Sheriff?
0: 
C:                        SHERIFF HASTINGS
D:           They weren’t married. Land goes to the

D:           It may be prudent for me to excuse myself

D:           Liability concerns and the like. As of now
D:           Allied Oil will be leaving at the end of
D:           the month, but if there should be any new

0: 
N: The husband, blood-soaked pinstriped shirt, three holes
N: in his chest, slumps against the wagon, still clutching a
N: rifle. The wife, wearing a chintzy dress, lies face up,
N: dead eyes covered in blood from her head wound.
0: 
N: A MANGY DOG’S SNOUT noses into the wound. Takes bloody
N: licks. Starts nipping for some flesh.
0: 
N: A WHISTLE in the woods. The dog’s head pops up. He trots
N: to the side of his master. A SKINNY, DIRTY MAN with a
N: SACK CLOTH MASK. They hunt through the trees together.
0: 
N: A few yards away, another SACK CLOTH MAN walks quietly,
N: bandolier of ANIMAL PAWS, an S-shaped blade in hand.
0: 
N: BEHIND A ROCK
0: 
N: A TERRIFIED GIRL (17). She dares a peek from behind the
N: rock. Can see the crippled stagecoach.
0: 
N: Yet another SACK CLOTH MAN passes close by and our girl
N: retreats behind the rock. This man has his mask above his
N: mouth to take swigs from a FLASK.
0: 
N: After he passes, our girl assesses. One direction, a free
N: and clear path. All she has to do is run. But she turns
N: back toward the stagecoach. Why?
0: 
N: She spies her dead father’s rifle. Steels herself...then
N: MAKES A RUN FOR THE GUN.
0: 
N: The world streaks by. She throws herself toward the rifle
N: and RIPS it from her father. She whirls, pointing it...
0: 
N: ...but no one’s there. She gamely holds the rifle aloft.
0: 
N: A TONGUE CLICK from her blindside and she spins to find a
N: SACK CLOTH MAN in suspenders and a green henley. A LIP
N: POP from behind her and she spins to see a second SACK
N: CLOTH MAN wearing the IDENTICAL OUTFIT.
0: 
N: Both have their hands on their gun holsters. As she
N: whirls back and forth between them, each one appears
N: closer to drawing. She settles on one of them to shoot --
0: 
N: -- but a hand SNATCHES the rifle away. Standing before
N: her is a tall, imposing SACK CLOTH MAN. Brown vest, belt
N: full of ammo, black handkerchief around his neck.
0: 
N: Our girl backs against the stagecoach in fear.

D:           Of course you have. But what gets lost in
D:           translation is that we’re really
D:           reasonable guys. I told your daddy not to
D:           draw on me, and then he did. I’d say it’s
D:           pretty reasonable to retaliate, don’t
D:           you? Now hopefully you can be more
D:           reasonable, though I fear obstinate
D:           traits tend to run in the family.

D:           Hmm. The way I see it, you could’ve taken
D:           off down that trail and in all the
D:           commotion, there’s a good chance we
D:           would’ve lost you. But instead, you came
D:           back. That makes me think there’s
D:           something very valuable inside here.
0: 
N: Blue Wade peeks through the window of the stagecoach --
0: 
N: -- and the girl DRAWS A HIDDEN GUN FROM HER BOOT,
N: pressing it against Blue Wade’s head. This girl’s got
N: fight. She might just --
0: 
N: -- SLICE. Viggo CHOPS the girl’s hand off at the wrist
N: with his S blade. Her arm stays up for a moment, body not
N: registering. She gazes in disbelief at her bloody stump.

N: EDGARDO (30s), the final member of the gang, jumps onto

N: Wade, who excitedly hops up. His excitement fades.
0:

N: Smoke, a plough affixed to its back.

D:           This is for you, Jesus. This is for all
D:           the ways I’ve failed you. All the ways
D:           I’m a miserable, irredeemable sinner.

C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           Now when the collection plate comes
D:           around today, I want you to give until it
D:           hurts. I want you to give because it
D:           hurts. Through that pain, I want you to
D:           show Jesus how serious you are about
D:           wanting, about needing his blessings. You
D:           say you want to bring prosperity back to
D:           this town. Well Jesus says, “How bad do
D:           you want it?”

D:           How you’re gonna hire some outlaws to go
D:           to the Logan ranch and chase an innocent
D:           man off his homestead.
0: 
N: This shocks everyone quiet. The pastor deftly redirects.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           An “innocent” man? You might want to take
D:           this blade to your tongue if it’s calling
D:           a man like that “innocent.” A stranger,
D:           an outsider, who enjoys the fruits of
D:           this town while only stalking the streets
D:           at night, never speaking to a soul, never
D:           setting foot inside these hallowed walls.
D:           A stranger who arrived in this town upon
D:           an ill wind that has dried the oil
D:           fields, soured the water, and crumbled
D:           the soil. Ask yourself -- is your life
D:           better or worse since that “innocent” man
D:           has come to town?
0: 
N: The crowd bubbles with dissent. A few “no’s” shouted.
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           I’ve been to the Logan Ranch myself. What
D:           I felt in that man wasn’t right. It
D:           wasn’t holy. How can we expect God’s
D:           bounty when we let the snake slither in
D:           the garden unbidden?
0: 
C:                        MCDONOUGH
D:           This is madness. We won’t get back what
D:           we’ve lost by turning on each other. If
D:           the oil’s dried, so be it, we need to
D:           adapt. We need to forge relationships
D:           with other towns. Create supply lines,
D:           infrastructure. I heard they even got
D:           electricity out in Grove City.
0: 
N: The congregation LAUGHS at the mention of “electricity.”
0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN

D:           If you don’t trust in me, then by all
D:           means, let this basket pass you by. But
D:           if you feel your heart beating faster at
D:           my words, know that that is not my doing,
D:           it is the Lord’s. And whatever choice you
D:           make is between you and Him.
0: 
N: With that, Pastor Nathan hands the basket to PAT (30s), a
N: spindly, destitute townie in the front pew, and TURNS
N: AWAY so that he can’t see what Pat does.
0: 
N: Everyone else, including McDonough, waits for him to act.
0: 
N: Finally, he pulls the last crumpled dollars from his
N: pocket and puts them in the basket. He passes the basket,
N: and the next congregant drops money in as well.

C:                        MCDONOUGH
D:           God help you all.

0: 
C:                        PASTOR NATHAN
D:           No. But I did expect you to be a bit more

0: 
C:                        BLUE WADE
D:           Discreet? Now what’s the point in that
D:           when the Lord sees all, right?
0: 
N: Pastor Nathan flashes a tight-lipped smile. He reaches
N: into the basket, but Blue Wade shakes his head, and
N: Pastor Nathan hands over the whole thing.

0:

0: 
N: Edgardo retreats, hiding behind others in the bar.
0: 
N: Martin is mid-stride when
0: 
N: BANG
0: 
N: He’s shot in the back. But unlike last time, he’s at full
N: strength. The shot does little but anger him.
0: 
N: He turns to face the coward who shot him and finds
N: Sheriff Hastings, flanked by his HONORARY DEPUTIES.
0: 
N: Martin marches toward them. They UNLOAD on the vampire.

N: This happens fast -- Martin slashes one deputy’s face

N: finishes by biting into SHERIFF HASTING’S SKULL.

N: He reaches MCDONOUGH’S GENERAL STORE. It too is locked,

0: 
N: THE BARTENDER’S POV
0: 
N: The saloon is destroyed.
0: 
N: Tables, chairs, windows all broken. Blood covering nearly

0: 
N: Eviscerated bodies lie everywhere. Broken bones jutting

0: 
N: Remarkably untouched:
0:

N: The bartender runs out of his saloon with all he’s got.
0: 
N: Martin lets him run. Reaches down and picks up a bloody
N: SIX-SHOOTER.
0: 
N: Casts a glance toward the window. Then stares at Edgardo.
0: 
N: He points the gun at the window and FIRES without

D:              You really are a monster, aren’t you?
D:              Leaving piles of bodies like this
D:              everywhere you go. Making more monsters
D:              out of everyone you touch. Me. Ruby.
0: 
N: Martin SNARLS. Blue Wade pulls out his knife and spins,
N: slicing the ROPE holding the CHANDELIER.
0: 
N: WOMP! Martin is CRUSHED underneath the chandelier. The
N: flames are everywhere now.
0: 
N: Blue Wade whips out his gun...but pops open the cylinder.
N: Slides OUT a bullet. What is he doing?
0: 
N: Blue Wade takes his knife and digs into the tip of the
N: bullet. He SLOPPILY PRAYS. In the face of death, he
N: finally asks God for help.
0: 
C:                           BLUE WADE
D:              Oh holy Lord God Jesus please do your

N: Blue Wade loads the bullet.
0: 
N: He points...
0: 
N: ...MARTIN IS STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM. He grips Blue
