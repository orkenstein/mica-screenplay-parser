M: 1.
S: EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY
N: A handsome man, ANTONIO FLORES (late 40s, kind eyes, questionable mustache), cruises down Canon in a Maserati convertible. He stops at a light next to a Lamborghini whose DRIVER gives Antonio a “rich guy” nod.
C: DRIVER
D: How do you like the GT?
C: ANTONIO
D: Honestly, I prefer the Q4. Better turning radius.
N: The light changes and Antonio zips off, pulling in front of KOBRA -- a high-end restaurant. He hops out and holds the door for the real OWNER of the car. Antonio is the VALET.
C: ANTONIO
D: Have a nice day, sir.
E: CONT'D
N: Antonio hustles back to the other VALETS. BENNY (40, owner of the parking concession) grabs KEYS off the board. NOTE: Dialogue in italics will be spoken in Spanish.
C: BENNY
D: Antonio, look alive.
N: He tosses the keys to Antonio who hightails it down the sidewalk. As he weaves through well-dressed shoppers, Antonio runs past a SALON where several PAPARAZZI wait outside.
S: INT. HIGH-END SALON - CONTINUOUS
N: OLIVIA ALLAN (30s, famous actress, two SAG Awards, one Golden Globe) has her hair done by the best in the biz. Olivia’s assistant, AMANDA (25, shoulda gone to law school) steps up.
C: AMANDA
D: Sorry, Olivia -- someone tipped off the paparazzi.
C: OLIVIA
D: They’re relentless.
C: AMANDA
D: Want me to pull the car into the back alley?
N: Olivia considers this as she checks herself in the mirror. It’s a really good hair day.
S: EXT. HIGH-END SALON - MOMENTS LATER

C: OLIVIA
D: You guys, you’re like flies on sh-- Like bees on honey.
E: catches herself
C: PAPARAZZI
D: Olivia!/You dating anyone?/Over here!/Olivia!
N: Olivia waves as she hops into her waiting Range Rover.
S: EXT. STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - DAY
N: A BILLBOARD for Olivia’s upcoming film, “EARHART” -- Olivia stands front and center, dressed as the famous pilot, her eyes filled with determination and mischief. PAN DOWN to find Antonio, riding his bicycle home from work. CREDITS ROLL as Antonio pedals across town. Starting in Beverly Hills, things become increasingly less affluent as he makes his way East.
S: INT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE - SAME TIME
N: Olivia rides a Peloton Bike in her mid-century modern in the Hollywood Hills with killer views of the city.
S: EXT. STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - DAY

S: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - LATER
N: A PUBLIC SCHOOL in the shadow of downtown. Antonio waits with his bike as THEATER KIDS straggle out. MARCO (15, gangly handsome, Antonio’s son) heads over as a CUTE GIRL crosses by with her friends.
C: SOFIA
D: See you, Marco. Promise I’ll know my lines by tomorrow.
C: MARCO
D: Bye, Sofia.
N: Marco and Antonio start walking down the sidewalk.
C: MARCO
D: Don’t say anything.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: I didn’t say anything.
C: MARCO
D: You’re smiling.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m allowed to smile.
C: MARCO
D: She’s in the play with me. That’s it.
C: ANTONIO
D: Okay. So how’s your mom doing?
E: then, fishing
C: MARCO
D: You said you weren’t gonna put me in the middle.
C: ANTONIO
D: You’re right, you’re right.
N: They walk down Alvarado in silence, then:
C: ANTONIO
D: Sofia’s pretty cute.
E: CONT'D
C: MARCO
D: I’m done.
N: Antonio smiles as Marco puts in EARBUDS.
S: EXT. BRENTWOOD MANSION - SAME TIME
N: A sprawling SPANISH COLONIAL estate with a few Mexican GARDENERS tending to the grounds.
C: KATHRYN
D: I need the tablecloths ironed -- I’m hosting a brunch for the board of the Red Cross...
E: O.S.
S: INT. BRENTWOOD MANSION, FOYER - CONTINUOUS
N: KATHRYN ROYCE (mid-40s, confident, polished) walks down the stairs dictating into a MINI DIGITAL RECORDER.
C: KATHRYN
D: Oh, and get cherries. I read an article -- they’re very rich in antioxidants.
N: She reaches the foyer as her housekeeper, BLANCA (38, Guatemalan immigrant), crosses with a basket of laundry.
C: KATHRYN
D: Perfect timing, Blanca. Just a few things. Should I put it right here?
E: CONT'D
C: BLANCA
D: That would be helpful, Mrs. Royce.
N: Kathryn places the recorder on the clothes. As Blanca walks off, GEORGE ROYCE (mid-40s, boyishly handsome, roguishly charming), sneaks up and kisses his wife on the neck.
C: GEORGE
D: I have to work tonight. Emergency pow-wow with Councilman Ramirez on the Pico-Union Project.
C: KATHRYN
D: You can’t tell me that while you’re kissing my neck.
C: GEORGE
D: I don’t know why the community’s fighting us so hard on this one. It’s really dampening my enthusiasm. How was your day?
C: KATHRYN
D: Strategic planning meeting at the museum. Two hours about parking. Two more about whether the new logo looks like a vagina. It does. And not a particularly inviting one. Why don’t we just quit everything and move to Paris.
E: off his laugh
C: GEORGE
D: You’d get sick of me.
C: KATHRYN
D: But we’d be in Paris.
S: EXT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER
N: Ten units, built in the 50s. Antonio lugs his bike upstairs. Marco follows with groceries as a Korean man, MR. KIM (75, elegant, little English), steps out of Antonio’s apartment with plumbing tools.
C: ANTONIO
D: Mr. Kim? Everything okay?
C: MR. KIM
D: Toilet. Flush good.
N: Mr. Kim hurries off. Antonio locks his bike to the balcony and they head inside to find...
S: INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: ...Antonio’s Mom, CECILIA (mid-70s, full of life), in a bathrobe, fixing a snack. Marco hugs his grandmother.
C: ANTONIO
D: Mom, are you putting something down the toilet? The landlord’s been here like three times this week.
C: CECILIA
D: It’s an old building.
C: ANTONIO
D: He needs to get a real handyman. I’m gonna talk to him.
N: Antonio heads for the door.
C: CECILIA
D: No. Listen, mijo, you’ll find out eventually -- Mr. Kim and I are lovers.
C: ANTONIO
D: What?
C: CECILIA
D: We’re very happy.
C: ANTONIO
D: Mr. Kim? You don’t know Korean. He doesn’t know Spanish. Between you, you have like ten words in English.
C: CECILIA
D: We speak a deeper language.
N: Antonio cringes as he tries to make sense of it all:
C: ANTONIO
D: So the freezer wasn’t broken?
N: She shakes her head “no.”
C: ANTONIO
D: And the garbage disposal?
E: CONT'D
N: She shakes her head “no” again.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN - LATER THAT EVENING
N: Olivia drives her RANGE ROVER down Figueroa, turning left into a PARKING STRUCTURE.
S: EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE, TOP LEVEL - MOMENTS LATER
N: The SUV drives up the ramp and parks next to the only other car, a black JAGUAR SEDAN with tinted windows. Olivia, hiding under a hoodie and sunglasses, gets out. She looks around, making sure she hasn’t been followed, then climbs into the back of the Jaguar.
S: EXT. GRAND STREET - LATER
N: The Jaguar drives past a luxury hotel, turns into the alley behind it, then down a ramp into the garage...
S: INT. HOTEL, BASEMENT GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: ...and parks next to the loading dock. Olivia steps out and hurries to the SERVICE ELEVATOR. She closes the metal gate and disappears into the building.
S: INT. HOTEL, PENTHOUSE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
N: Olivia knocks on the door of the PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. After a beat, GEORGE opens it.
C: GEORGE
D: God, I’ve missed that hoodie.
N: She hurries in, quickly closes the door behind her...
C: OLIVIA
D: I hate how much this turns me on.
N: ...and kisses him.
S: INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Antonio cooks dinner with his sister CLARA (35, elementary school principal, less nurturing then you’d expect). On the couch, Marco does homework. His cousins, DANTE and LUCA (9, twins, both evil), watch videos on an old iPad.
C: CLARA
D: So I was talking to one of the teachers at school, she’s going through a divorce too, and--
C: ANTONIO
D: We’re not divorced. We’re separated.
N: Benny (Clara’s husband, Antonio’s boss) walks in from down the hall.
C: BENNY
D: You need a candle in your bathroom. Or a least some kind of spray.
C: CLARA
D: Tell my stupid brother how pretty the new music teacher is.
C: BENNY
D: She’s fine. She’s okay. She’s about what you could probably get.
C: CLARA
D: You don’t think she’s pretty?
C: BENNY
D: No, I don’t. Know who’s pretty? The gym lady. With that whistle.
C: DANTE
D: I’d hit that.
C: CLARA
D: Dante! Where you getting this? No more videos. I mean it, Monstro!
N: The boys IGNORE HER and keep watching as Cecilia enters.
C: CLARA
D: Mom, are you really dating Mr. Kim?
E: CONT'D
C: CECILIA
D: You gonna be judgmental?
C: BENNY
D: I can answer that.
N: There’s a KNOCK on the door. Antonio opens it to find his ex, ISABEL (42, pretty even in a Gelson’s cashier smock).
C: ISABEL
D: Sorry I’m early. We were over- staffed today.
C: ANTONIO
D: Come in. Stay for dinner.
C: CLARA
D: We’re making asada.
C: ISABEL
D: I should get going. Marco, get your stuff, honey.
C: ANTONIO
D: You alright? You seem upset--
C: ISABEL
D: I’m fine. I just got some bad news.
N: Antonio leads her OUTSIDE to the...
S: EXT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: ...balcony walkway, closing the door behind them -- for privacy, even though the courtyard is filled with neighbors.
C: ISABEL
D: The bank denied my loan. I have to take the year off from school.
C: ANTONIO
D: Why?
C: ISABEL
D: My car broke down, I fell behind on some payments and ugh -- two semesters, that’s all I have left.
C: ANTONIO
D: How much do you need? I have a little savings.
C: ISABEL
D: $12,850. You got that laying around?
C: ANTONIO
D: I can take a second job. We can figure this out.
C: ISABEL
D: It’s not your problem.
C: ANTONIO
D: I want it to be my problem. You’ve worked so hard. You’re gonna be a great physical therapist.
N: She takes a breath, then:
C: ISABEL
D: Listen, there’s no easy way to say this... I started seeing someone.
C: ANTONIO
D: What? Who?
E: gut-punched
C: ISABEL
D: His name’s Randy. He’s a realtor.
C: ANTONIO
D: “Randy the Realtor?” The guy from the bus benches? This guy?
N: Antonio strikes a “cool guy” pose, FINGER GUNS a-blazing.
C: ISABEL
D: He’s nice to me.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m not nice to you?
C: ISABEL
D: Let’s not fight, Antonio. People change.
C: ANTONIO
D: I haven’t.
C: ISABEL
D: I know.
N: Marco steps out with his backpack and a small suitcase.
C: MARCO
D: Abuelita ran out of medicine. Tia says if she has another heart attack you’ll have to answer to the Virgin Mary. She only gets religious when she’s really mad. Just wanted you to know what you’re walking into, Dad.
N: Still reeling, Antonio watches his wife and son walk away.
S: INT. HOTEL, PENTHOUSE SUITE - LATER
N: Olivia and George, post-sex, cuddle in bed.
C: GEORGE
D: That was life changing.
C: OLIVIA
D: I’ve been doing a lot of pilates.
N: As she snuggles into him, George phone BUZZES on the beside table. He glances at the text.
C: OLIVIA
D: Who’s that? Is that Kathryn?
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Doesn’t matter. We have two more uninterrupted hours. We can shut the world out.
N: He puts the phone down and kisses her. His phone buzzes again. They try to ignore it, but:
C: OLIVIA
D: I don’t think I can do this anymore.
C: GEORGE
D: I didn’t even look that time.
C: OLIVIA
D: I need to go.
C: GEORGE
D: Come on. Stay. I’ll order another bottle.
N: She gets up and starts putting on her clothes.
C: OLIVIA
D: You know the only person I’ve told about us? My assistant. I’m too embarrassed to tell anyone else.
C: GEORGE
D: How do you think I feel? I’m madly in love with the most incredible woman in the world and I want to scream it from the rooftop.
C: OLIVIA
D: I can’t believe I’m in this situation. I’m a role model -- young girls look up to me. I just started a company dedicated to telling women’s stories. You’re the one who encouraged me to do it. You gave me the confidence.
C: GEORGE
D: I didn’t know it was gonna bite me in the ass.
C: OLIVIA
D: How can I explain this? Sneaking around with someone else’s husband, using code names and having clandestine meetings like some sort of slutty spy?
C: GEORGE
D: You could tell them that maybe... you love me?
C: OLIVIA
D: I do love you, George, but--
C: GEORGE
D: I’m gonna leave her. I swear. Events conspired against us, you know that. I was on my way to tell her -- speech and everything -- when her mom died.
C: OLIVIA
D: And then she got depressed.
C: GEORGE
D: I’m just waiting for her to get her sea legs back.
C: OLIVIA
D: Do you realize it’s been a year? Literally. We met exactly one year ago today.
C: GEORGE
D: I do know. It’s our anniversary. I have presents.
N: He opens the bedside table and hands her a wrapped book.
C: GEORGE
D: I got you a few sparkly things too, but this is what I’m most proud of.
E: CONT'D
N: Reluctantly, she opens it. It’s a classic memoir.
C: OLIVIA
D: Bette Davis?
C: GEORGE
D: First edition. Signed. 1938.
C: OLIVIA
D: How’d you know she was my favorite?
C: GEORGE
D: I did a little research.
C: OLIVIA
D: It’s perfect.
N: So perfect it makes her sad. She kisses him sweetly.
C: OLIVIA
D: Goodbye, George.
E: CONT'D
N: She grabs her bag and starts out...
C: GEORGE
D: Olivia, wait. I’m in a loveless marriage. The only time I feel alive is when--
N: ...CLOSING the door behind her. He jumps out of bed, stumbling as he tries to put on his pants.
S: EXT. ROYCE HOTEL - SAME TIME
N: Several PAPARAZZI wait for celebrities at this LA hot spot.
C: PAPARAZZI #1
D: I don’t get it. This place was on fire last night.
C: PAPARAZZI #2
D: Rocky says the Chateau’s dead, too. I’m calling it.
N: They pack up their gear.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN CVS DRUG STORE - SAME TIME
N: Antonio walks out with a PHARMACY BAG.
S: INT. HOTEL, PENTHOUSE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
N: Olivia waits for the elevator, ordering an Uber. George bursts out of his penthouse and runs down the empty hallway.
C: GEORGE
D: I just need a little more--
N: DING! Olivia gets on the elevator. George arrives just as the doors close. Dammit! He frantically pushes the call button.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Antonio rides his bike, the CVS BAG slung over the handlebar.
S: INT. HOTEL, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Olivia steps out of the elevator. Hotel staff and guests BUZZ WITH EXCITEMENT as she hightails it across the lobby. The other elevator opens. George speed-walks to catch up with her, WHISPER-YELLING:
C: GEORGE
D: You can’t go out the front.
C: OLIVIA
D: I can if you don’t follow me.
S: EXT. HOTEL, ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
N: Olivia rushes out, the name of the hotel illuminated above her in giant letters: ROYCE. She searches for her Uber. George keeps pace, nervously looking around.
C: GEORGE
D: You’re being reckless.
C: OLIVIA
D: You’re being reckless.
N: A SILVER MAZDA pulls up. The UBER DRIVER lowers the window.
C: OLIVIA
D: Dave?
E: CONT'D
C: UBER DRIVER
D: Billie Jean King?
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN - CONTINUOUS
N: Antonio pedals along when something catches his eye -- A BUS BENCH AD for “Randy the Realtor,” bright white teeth, finger guns a-blazing. Antonio stares at it with disgust, until -- BAM! He plows into the back of OLIVIA’S UBER, throwing him off his bike onto the street. Olivia runs over to help Antonio.
C: OLIVIA
D: Oh, my God -- are you okay?
C: ANTONIO
D: Yes. Just embarrassed. Never thought I’d get hit by a parked car.
N: Pedestrians stop to watch.
C: GEORGE
D: He’s fine. Everyone’s looking.
N: DAVE the Uber driver (32, drummer) rushes out.
C: UBER DRIVER
D: Dude! What the hell?! This is my mom’s car!
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m sorry. I’ll pay for any damage.
N: George shoves a WAD OF CASH in the driver’s hand.
C: GEORGE
D: No damage! Not a scratch! Five stars!
N: The driver checks the bumper, pockets the money, and gets back in the car. ACROSS THE WAY, one of the paparazzi steps out of a FROZEN YOGURT SHOP. He sees Olivia with George, ducks behind a tree and starts taking PHOTOS -- they have no idea. As Antonio picks up his CVS BAG, George pleads with Olivia:
C: GEORGE
D: Can we please go back inside?
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: What’s wrong with you? This poor man needs our help.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m okay. You don’t need to worry about me.
N: Antonio starts gathering his mangled bike.
C: GEORGE
D: See? All good! Now let’s go upstairs.
C: OLIVIA
D: Are you sure?
E: to Antonio
C: ANTONIO
D: Yes. Yes. I’m just gonna go home.
N: As Olivia hops in the Uber, she turns to George:
C: OLIVIA
D: Call me when you’re divorced.
N: She slams the door. Antonio takes one last look at her as they drive away. Is that Olivia Allan?
S: EXT. PICO-UNION - THE NEXT MORNING
N: A tree-lined boulevard. Not fancy but full of life -- small businesses, colorful murals, people hanging out. Antonio drags his broken bike down the block.
C: WOMAN
D: I’ll throw in a new reflector...
E: O.S.
S: INT. CITY BIKES - CONTINUOUS
N: A funky shop serving the community -- used and new bikes, on-site repairs, local Latinx music on the sound system. The owner, an attractive gear-head, NATALIE (40, good tattoos, Salvadoran-American) playfully gives Antonio shit as she puts a new wheel on his bike.
C: NATALIE
D: You’re clearly a safety risk. And I’ll give you a horn too, so people hear you coming.
N: She calls to LU, a female bike mechanic (20s, butch).
C: NATALIE
D: Where container of honks?
E: CONT'D
C: LU
D: Under the counter.
N: As she grabs one, Antonio teases her:
C: ANTONIO
D: Your Spanish is terrible.
C: NATALIE
D: It’s as good as your English.
C: ANTONIO
D: That’s not even close to true.
C: NATALIE
D: Okay, my Spanish sucks. It’s a source of shame.
C: LU
D: She’s taking night classes. It’s very cute.
C: ANTONIO
D: Hola, Natalie. Me llamo Antonio.
E: slowly and clearly
C: NATALIE
D: You’re both jerks. I’m taking back the horn.
N: Antonio laughs.
C: NATALIE
D: Hey, you hear they’re trying to kick us out? Some asshole developer bought the whole block.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: No, that’s awful.
C: NATALIE
D: Fifteen years and now I’m getting priced out. All of us. I hope you like juice bars and spin classes.
C: ANTONIO
D: They’re gonna replace your bike shop with bikes that don’t go anywhere?
N: She hands him a FLYER.
C: NATALIE
D: There’s a City Council meeting next week -- we need to pack the place.
S: INT. OLIVIA'S PRODUCTION COMPANY - SAME TIME
N: A small, but cool CULVER CITY INDUSTRIAL SPACE. Olivia talks with Amanda in her office which overlooks a bullpen where a few young, hopeful women work at laptops.
C: OLIVIA
D: You know how hard it is to find someone who’s successful in their own right so they’re not intimidated by my success? Who’s fun and sexy as hell and buys me books and is not an actor because they’re too much work?
C: AMANDA
D: I don’t feel qualified to offer an opinion -- in terms of life experience, or job title or really--
C: OLIVIA
D: I mean, I’m too much work -- I know that. Maybe I drew too hard a line.
C: AMANDA
D: Isn’t there someone else you can talk to who might you know better? Like Jennifer Aniston? Aren’t you guys like best friends?
C: OLIVIA
D: We did a movie together. We played best friends -- we didn’t even really like each other.
C: AMANDA
D: What about your mom? She called again last week.
C: OLIVIA
D: You talk about real stuff with your mom?
C: AMANDA
D: You don’t?
C: OLIVIA
D: My mom was a drunk and embezzled from me. I testified against her in court. She went to jail. Have you not Googled me?
C: AMANDA
D: I will now.
C: OLIVIA
D: You should read the Vanity Fair article. It’s actually pretty good. I mean, depressing. But hopeful. Ultimately. I think.
N: Olivia searches for the article on her computer...
C: OLIVIA
D: Just so you know, the “source close to the family” is me. Oh, no!
E: CONT'D then, noticing
N: Amanda looks over Olivia’s shoulder. On the TMZ WEBSITE -- the PAPARAZZI PHOTO of George and Olivia with Antonio (his face blurred out) next to her. The headline: “George and Olivia: Secret Romance?”
C: OLIVIA
D: No no no!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. BRENTWOOD MANSION - SAME TIME
N: At the breakfast table, Kathryn shows George the TMZ PHOTO.
C: GEORGE
D: This is bullshit. I’ve never met the woman.
C: KATHRYN
D: Then how do you explain this?
C: GEORGE
D: I have no idea. I walked the Councilman to his car and, sure, I noticed her, but there were a lot of celebrities last night -- including a few Lakers so I was more excited about that.
C: KATHRYN
D: It says you were having a “lover’s spat.”
C: GEORGE
D: I didn’t say a word to her.
N: On the ropes, he thinks quick and points to the photo:
C: GEORGE
D: She was with this guy.
E: CONT'D
C: KATHRYN
D: The guy with the blurred-out face?
C: GEORGE
D: Yes. They’re the couple. They were the ones bickering.
C: KATHRYN
D: Do you think I’m stupid?
C: GEORGE
D: Honey, you know the press -- they always get it wrong.
C: KATHRYN
D: I want to believe you.
C: GEORGE
D: You can believe me. I know I’ve made mistakes in the past, but I’d never do anything to hurt our marriage again. I love you. I’m happy. We’ll talk more about this tonight, but right now I have twenty pissed-off civil servants waiting for me downtown.
N: As he heads out:
C: GEORGE
D: I’m calling my lawyer from the car. They owe us an apology!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. OLIVIA'S PRODUCTION COMPANY, OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER
N: Amanda’s on the phone as Olivia paces, upset.
C: OLIVIA
D: “Earhart” opens in five days. I can’t have this getting out there.
C: AMANDA
D: Jessica’s on a party plane to London for her nephew’s bar mitzvah.
E: cups phone
C: OLIVIA
D: They’re having destination bar mitzvah’s now?! Shit, tell her to call me the second she lands! I need my publicist! And an Ativan!
C: AMANDA
D: You heard that, right? She’s freaking out.
E: into phone whispering
C: OLIVIA
D: Yes, I’m freaking out!
N: Olivia heads to her bathroom. Amanda hangs up and follows.
C: OLIVIA
D: This is the first movie under my own banner. It took me twelve years to get it made. This is my dream. I’m finally calling the shots.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. OLIVIA'S PRODUCTION OFFICE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS (D2)
N: They enter.
C: OLIVIA
D: Women like me. They identify with me. They want to think I could be their friend. Not that I’m gonna fuck their husbands.
N: Olivia opens the medicine cabinet.
C: OLIVIA
D: These are very judgmental times! You can’t just be a good actress, you have to be a good person too. I’m not that good of a person. Half the people I follow on Instagram it’s only because I hate them. Where the hell are they?
E: CONT'D re: pills
C: AMANDA
D: Bottom left. Next to the Xanax.
N: She grabs it, and they head out.
S: INT. OLIVIA’S PRODUCTION COMPANY, OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: They walk back in.
C: OLIVIA
D: I have three studios circling this company waiting to see how the box office does. If this movie tanks... ...all this will go bye-bye. The flowers. The Smart Water. The hopeful young women. The young women’s hopes. Everything! Ahhh! I can’t open this.
E: indicating the office re: bottle
N: She throws the bottle against the glass. The hopeful young women look over, concerned. Olivia gives a cheery thumbs-up.
S: EXT. ROYCE TOWER - LATER
N: A sleek downtown skyscraper, emblazoned with a familiar name: “ROYCE.” He puts it on everything.
C: GEORGE
D: I was blindsided!
S: INT. ROYCE TOWER, GEORGE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: The CORNER SUITE with a view of the city.
C: GEORGE
D: I panicked! I’m not sure Kathryn believed me!
N: George paces, venting to his lawyer, DANIEL (45, Ivy League).
C: DANIEL
D: Let me help you out -- she did not.
C: GEORGE
D: She’s gonna divorce me! I’ll lose the company. If I humiliate her with a big public scandal, she and her father will squeeze me out. There’s gotta be some way to fix this.
C: DANIEL
D: We could create a time machine and have you make better choices.
C: GEORGE
D: I’d start by hiring a less sanctimonious lawyer.
N: Daniel considers the situation in earnest:
C: DANIEL
D: Okay, look, if I had a few weeks, maybe I could buy up enough shares through a dummy company to protect your position.
C: GEORGE
D: I don’t have a few weeks.
C: DANIEL
D: Maybe you do. What if, and I’m just formulating this, we find the guy in the photo and get him and Olivia to pretend to be a couple.
C: GEORGE
D: However much I’m paying you, it’s too much.
C: DANIEL
D: Think about it. All they’d have to do is be seen in public a few times, get some pictures in the tabloids -- and just like that, a lie becomes the truth.
S: EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - THE NEXT DAY
N: Antonio drives a Porsche down Canon, not a care in the world.
S: EXT. KOBRA, VALET STAND - SAME TIME
N: Benny, Javier and Rudy chat by the VALET STAND. Nearby, a slick BOND TRADER waits for his car, on his cell:
C: BOND TRADER
D: Which Panties? The Vegas panties?
C: JAVIER
D: You listening to this douchebag? Does he not see us standing here? It’s like we’re invisible.
C: BOND TRADER
D: Okay, that’s it -- I’m canceling my two o’clock. Handcuff yourself to the outdoor shower.
C: BENNY
D: Tried talking to my wife like that once. Did not go well.
S: INT. PORSCHE - CONTINUOUS
N: As Antonio gets near the restaurant, the BLUETOOTH kicks in: BOND TRADER’S GIRLFRIEND (ON SPEAKER) Tell me how bad you want it. Come on, Gordon, beg for it.
C: ANTONIO
D: Ma’am--
N: BOND TRADER’S GIRLFRIEND (ON SPEAKER) Yes, call me ma’am -- that’s so hot.
C: ANTONIO
D: You don’t understand, I’m the valet.
N: BOND TRADER’S GIRLFRIEND (ON SPEAKER) Oooh, the valet. And I’m a horny, rich bitch. What’re you gonna do to me?
C: ANTONIO
D: Just one minute, please.
N: Antonio pulls in front of the restaurant...
S: EXT. KOBRA - CONTINUOUS
N: ...hops out, holding the door for the Bond Trader.
C: ANTONIO
D: Enjoy your afternoon, sir.
N: As the Bond Trader drives off, Antonio sees another car pull up. George’s lawyer, Daniel, steps out. Antonio gives him a ticket, and climbs in.
S: INT. MERCEDES - CONTINUOUS
N: As he adjusts the seat, Daniel gets in the passenger side.
C: ANTONIO
D: Did you forget something?
C: DANIEL

C: DANIEL
D: Yes. You’ll go on a few dates.
C: ANTONIO
D: Me? Go on dates with Olivia Allan?
C: DANIEL
D: Correct.
C: ANTONIO
D: How much do I have to pay?
C: DANIEL
D: No, we pay you.
C: ANTONIO
D: Did Benny put you up to this? You one of his friends from the cigar store? Very good. You had me going.
E: starts laughing
C: DANIEL
D: Mr. Flores, we desperately need your help. You can name your price. I work for a billionaire.
S: INT. GEORGE'S OFFICE - LATER
N: George and Daniel.
C: GEORGE
D: $12,850?
C: DANIEL
D: The exactness of the sum surprised me too. $12,850, not a penny more, not a penny less. Now it’s your turn.
C: GEORGE
D: Olivia’s not gonna be so easy. Never have an affair with a woman who doesn’t need your money.
S: EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE, TOP FLOOR - LATER
N: A DRIVER stands, smoking, ten yards from the BLACK JAGUAR and Olivia’s RANGE ROVER.
C: GEORGE
D: Two weeks is all I’m asking...
S: INT. JAGUAR - CONTINUOUS
N: In the backseat, George makes his case to Olivia.
C: GEORGE
D: Then we can finally be together.
C: OLIVIA
D: I’ll do it.
C: GEORGE
D: Really? You will?
C: OLIVIA
D: It’s a big story. If they buy it, it’ll bury any press about us.
C: GEORGE
D: I knew you loved me. I knew you’d do this for me.
C: OLIVIA
D: I’m not doing it for you, George. I’m doing it for Amelia Earhart. Now tell me about this guy in the photo.
E: then
S: INT. RANCHO PARK DRIVING RANGE - LATER
N: As a mixture of unemployed actors and old people hit golf balls, Kathryn confers on a bench with a detective, STEGMAN (40s, gruff, Members Only jacket). He hands her a file.
C: STEGMAN
D: Antonio Miguel Flores. Forty-seven. Lives with his mom. Three hundred and twenty dollars in the bank, yet has an excellent credit rating. A rare combination. The guy’s squeaky clean.
C: KATHRYN
D: No way she’s dating a valet.
C: STEGMAN
D: I’ve been in this game a long time. Seen weirder couples. Much weirder.
S: INT. OLIVA’S CAR / EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - THE NEXT DAY
N: Olivia drives down Doheny. Her phone rings. She answers:
C: OLIVIA
D: Yes?
S: INT. ROYCE TOWER, GEORGE’S OFFICE - INTERCUT
N: Daniel and George huddle over the speaker-phone.
C: DANIEL
D: Look in your rearview mirror. There’s a green Yaris.
N: IN THE MIRROR, Stegman keeps a respectable distance.
C: OLIVIA
D: I’m being followed?
C: GEORGE
D: Love you, babe.
C: DANIEL
D: That’s Stegman. Ex LAPD. Works for Mrs. Royce.
C: OLIVIA
D: How do you know?
C: DANIEL
D: We have eyes on their eyes. The portly gentleman in the Subaru two cars back is Perez. He works for us.
N: REVEAL PEREZ (40s, enjoys food) eating string cheese as he tails Stegman.
C: DANIEL
D: Your every move is being watched.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. KOBRA, VALET STAND - LATER
N: At the VALET STAND, Benny talks with Antonio.
C: BENNY
D: Your sister really wants you to give that music teacher a shot. Maybe I was too hard on her. This is from their retreat in Lake Arrowhead... A little pear-shaped, but she has a nice smile, right?
E: shows picture on his phone
N: Javier and Rudy hang car keys on the board.
C: ANTONIO
D: I told you, I don’t wanna be set up.
C: RUDY
D: Know who you should go out with? That honey at the bike shop. She’s got that sweet face, and she can fix shit -- nothing hotter than that.
C: JAVIER
D: Whoa, whoa -- way out of his league.
C: BENNY
D: Yeah, don’t get his expectations out of whack.
C: RUDY
D: What’re you talking about? This is a nice looking man.
C: BENNY
D: Charitably a five.
C: JAVIER
D: And God knows his job ain’t opening any legs.
N: Olivia’s Range Rover pulls up to the curb. Rudy opens the door. She steps out, a VISION OF HOTNESS.
C: OLIVIA
D: I’ll only be a second.
N: Heads turn as this sexy, famous actress strides over...
C: OLIVIA
D: Hi, babe.
E: CONT'D
N: ...and KISSES Antonio -- a real big-screen kiss. No one can believe it -- not the CUSTOMERS on the patio, not the WAIT STAFF, not the DETECTIVES snapping photos, not even ANTONIO, and especially not the other VALETS.
C: OLIVIA
D: Are you his boss? Is it okay if I steal Antonio away for lunch?
E: CONT'D to Benny
C: BENNY
D: Buh. Yuh. Uh. Yuh. Lunch.
E: nodding his head “yes”
C: OLIVIA
D: Thanks, you’re a sweetheart.
N: Antonio and Olivia stroll back to her car. Benny follows.
C: BENNY
D: What’s?... What’s?... What’s happening here?
N: Antonio doesn’t know what to say. Olivia jumps in:
C: OLIVIA
D: It’s new. We don’t want to label it.
N: Antonio and Olivia drive off, leaving the valets slack-jawed.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ROBERTSON BOULEVARD - LATER
N: With the HOLLYWOOD HILLS behind them, the Range Rover cruises past art galleries and pricey boutiques.
S: INT. OLIVA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Olivia drives. Antonio sits in the passenger seat, nervous -- not sure where to look or how to behave.
C: ANTONIO
D: You keep your car very clean.
C: OLIVIA
D: Look, I’m embarrassed you got roped into this -- you don’t need to make small talk if you don’t want to.
N: Olivia pulls up to a light and grabs her phone.
C: ANTONIO
D: It’s just -- you can tell a lot about a person by they way they treat their car.
N: Olivia writes a text, not really listening.
C: OLIVIA
D: My assistant takes care of it.
C: ANTONIO
D: They do a good job. The floor mats are like new.
N: Antonio looks out the window and notices a streetlight BANNER FOR LACMA -- is that supposed to be a vagina?
C: OLIVIA
D: Okay, we’re all set -- my publicist tipped off the paparazzi.
C: ANTONIO
D: There’s gonna be paparazzi?
C: OLIVIA
D: That’s kind of the point.
N: The light changes and they drive off.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m getting nervous. My palms are sweaty. Do you have Kleenex?
C: OLIVIA
D: Relax. They’re just going to take a few pictures.
C: ANTONIO
D: I don’t even like being in family photos.
C: OLIVIA
D: You just have to walk into the Ivy and eat lunch with me.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’ve never been to a fancy restaurant.
C: OLIVIA
D: You work at a fancy restaurant.
C: ANTONIO
D: They don’t let us use the bathroom. I have to pee at the gas station. I’m really sweating.
N: Olivia pulls over and stops.
C: OLIVIA
D: Antonio -- I need you to get your shit together.
C: ANTONIO
D: Do you really think anyone’s gonna believe you’re dating someone like me?
C: OLIVIA
D: Not if you can’t stop sweating! You look like a dolphin.
N: Olivia hands him a make-up wipe.
C: OLIVIA
D: Here. Towel off.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: Thank you.
C: OLIVIA
D: Now get your shit together!
C: ANTONIO
D: Okay, okay. My shit -- I think it’s together.
S: INT. ROYCE TOWER, GEORGE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: Daniel shows George the photos of Olivia KISSING Antonio.
C: GEORGE
D: She must really love me. Going out there and kissing a guy like that.
C: DANIEL
D: She’s certainly giving it her all.
C: GEORGE
D: What’s that supposed to mean?
C: DANIEL
D: Nothing. She’s just very convincing.
C: GEORGE
D: You make these statements that are neutral on the surface, but I know what you’re doing -- you’re trying to get under my skin.
C: DANIEL
D: Just reminding you sometimes actions have unintended consequences.
C: GEORGE
D: Your negativity’s a real bummer. No more photos. Keep me on a need to know basis.
S: EXT. THE IVY RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
N: The Range Rover pulls up to the Valet Stand. A handful of PAPARAZZI lay in wait -- some with cameras, some with video.
S: INT. OLIVA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Olivia puts the car in park. Antonio takes a breath, anxious.
C: OLIVIA
D: Okay, showtime.
N: She gets out and...
S: EXT. THE IVY RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
N: ...the CAMERAS start CLICKING. An IVY VALET opens the door for Antonio. He sheepishly gets out.
C: IVY VALET
D: Welcome to The Ivy.
C: ANTONIO
D: Thank you. Paint’s chipped on the driver’s side and there’s a ding on the back bumper.
N: The Paparazzi confer as they shoot:
C: PAPARAZZI #3
D: Who’s that? Is he somebody?
C: PAPARAZZI #4
D: Never seen him before.
N: As Olivia joins Antonio, the Paparazzi shout:
C: PAPARAZZI #4
D: What happened to George Royce?
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: I’ve never met Mr. Royce.
N: Olivia takes Antonio’s hand.
C: OLIVIA
D: This is my boyfriend -- Antonio.
E: CONT'D
C: PAPARAZZI #5
D: Antonio, are you an actor?
C: OLIVIA
D: He’s a valet.
C: PAPARAZZI #5
D: No, really?
C: OLIVIA
D: Really. I’ve dated enough actors. They’re too much work.
C: IVY VALET
D: Are you really a valet?
E: to Antonio
C: ANTONIO
D: Yes, I work at Kobra.
N: The Ivy valet gives Antonio a “fuck yeah” first bump as Olivia leads Antonio into the restaurant.
S: EXT. THE IVY RESTAURANT, PATIO - A LITTLE LATER
N: All eyes are on Olivia and Antonio as they sit at a table with menus.
C: ANTONIO
D: Everyone’s looking at us. I don’t like it.
C: OLIVIA
D: You get used to it.
C: ANTONIO
D: They’re taking photos again. Don’t they have enough?
C: OLIVIA
D: Say something. I’m gonna laugh really hard.
C: ANTONIO
D: What? I don’t understand.
N: She LAUGHS uproariously and touches his arm.
C: OLIVIA
D: That’s the one they’re gonna run. They always use the laughing shot.
N: The WAITER steps up.
C: WAITER
D: Are you ready to order?
C: OLIVIA
D: The small chopped salad. No dressing.
C: WAITER
D: Sir?
C: ANTONIO
D: Do you have hamburgers here?
C: WAITER
D: We can do that for you. How would you like it prepared?
C: ANTONIO
D: With lettuce and tomato.
C: WAITER
D: I meant the meat.
C: ANTONIO
D: On a bun. Under the lettuce and tomato.
C: WAITER
D: How do you want it cooked, sir?
C: ANTONIO
D: Very cooked. All the way through.
C: WAITER
D: Well-done.
C: ANTONIO
D: Thank you.
N: The waiter nods, and walks off.
C: OLIVIA
D: Maybe the less you say the better.
C: ANTONIO
D: I should go wash my hands -- I touch a lot of keys.
N: Olivia starts answering emails as Antonio gets up. He walks towards the bathroom, a CUSTOMER mistakes Antonio for a busboy, and flags him down, holding up his empty glass.
C: CUSTOMER
D: Could I get more iced tea?
C: ANTONIO
D: Um, actually, I’m not--
N: But then Antonio sees a PITCHER nearby at the bus station and, what the hell, it’ll be easier to just pour the drink. He grabs the iced tea and refills the glass.
C: ANTONIO
D: There you go.
E: CONT'D
N: As Antonio goes to return the pitcher, a customer at another table signals for him. Resigned, Antonio fills her glass too. Olivia looks up, shocked to see Antonio continue around the table pouring everyone iced tea. She rolls her eyes -- this guy’s hopeless. She stops an actual BUSBOY.
C: OLIVIA
D: Would you mind doing that for him?
S: EXT. ROBERTSON BOULEVARD - LATER
N: Parked across the street, Stegman takes photos of the “couple” from his Yaris. PAN to REVEAL Perez, two cars back, watching while he dials his phone on speaker.
C: HOST
D: The Ivy.
E: O.S.
C: PEREZ
D: You guys deliver?
C: HOST
D: Depends, how close are you?
E: O.S.
C: PEREZ
D: Very. Now be honest -- the risotto, does it travel?
S: EXT. THE IVY RESTAURANT, PATIO - LATER
N: The waiter brings the food -- a burger for Antonio, a small salad for Olivia.
C: ANTONIO
D: Is that all you’re eating?
C: OLIVIA
D: My premiere’s on Thursday and I have a very unforgiving dress to squeeze into -- this is pretty much my last non-juice meal.
C: ANTONIO
D: Is that healthy?
C: OLIVIA
D: Nope, not on any level. By the way, you’re gonna be my date.
E: then, back to business
C: ANTONIO
D: To a Hollywood movie premiere?
C: OLIVIA
D: If we’re seen on the red carpet, it’ll kill any last rumors about me and George.
C: ANTONIO
D: I need to get a tuxedo, right? And a haircut?
C: OLIVIA
D: I have people who’ll take care of everything for you.
C: ANTONIO
D: Are you sure? My cousin Chucho owns a tux rental store and they have a barbershop right in back.
C: OLIVIA
D: No insult to Chucho, but let my people fix you up.
C: ANTONIO
D: He’ll give me a good deal. Probably throw in shoes for free.
C: OLIVIA
D: It’s okay. And how committed are you to the mustache?
E: then, sizing him up
C: ANTONIO
D: You don’t like it?
C: OLIVIA
D: I’m sure there was a time it was very fashionable.
N: As Antonio uses his knife to look at his mustache, the iced tea Customer walks by and does a double-take when he sees the “busboy” sitting with Olivia Allan.
S: EXT. KOBRA - A LITTLE LATER
N: Antonio hops out of Olivia’s car.
C: ANTONIO
D: Thanks again for lunch.
N: As she drives off, the valets rush over.
C: RUDY
D: Guey, you’re blowing up the internet.
N: Rudy shows him papparazzi photos from The Ivy.
C: ANTONIO
D: What? That just happened.
C: RUDY
D: “The Actress and the Valet.” You’re mythic. It’s like a Cinderella story in reverse.
C: BENNY
D: Have you had sex with her? Don’t tell me if you’ve had sex with her! Don’t tell me!
C: ANTONIO
D: Okay.
C: BENNY
D: You’re having sex with her, you bastard! I know you’re having sex with her! Tell me you’re having sex with her! Tell me!
C: ANTONIO
D: I don’t know what you want to hear.
C: BENNY
D: I don’t want to hear anything!
C: JAVIER
D: Flying too close to the sun, brother. They don’t like us dating their women. That’s when they start asking questions. That’s when they deport you.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m legal. I’m a citizen.
C: JAVIER
D: You are?
C: ANTONIO
D: Yeah. You’re not?
C: JAVIER
D: Yeah, I’m totally legal.
E: covering
C: BENNY
D: And what’re you saying that’s so funny? You’ve never once made me laugh.
E: re: photo
S: INT. ISABEL’S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Isabel, on her laptop, pours over pictures of Antonio and Olivia. Marco gets himself a glass of milk.
C: ISABEL
D: Did you know about this?
C: MARCO
D: No -- but I’m only with him three days a week.
C: ISABEL
D: And he hasn’t said anything about being with one of the most famous women in the world?
C: MARCO
D: Dad doesn’t talk about his sex life.
C: ISABEL
D: They’re having sex?!
C: MARCO
D: I don’t know. I’m as shocked as you. I had no idea Dad had this kind of game.
C: ISABEL
D: He doesn’t have game. He has no game. He’s game free. He has minus game.
C: MARCO
D: He’s got something. He’s dating Olivia Allan. Listen, you’ll always be my mom, but if she ends up being my second mom, I’d be kinda psyched. It’s good for actors to be around other actors.
S: EXT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE - LATER
N: As Olivia and Amanda walk to the front door, a Latinx POOL MAN emerges from the back, carrying his gear.
C: POOL MAN
D: Hi, Ms. Allan. I fixed the filter.
C: OLIVIA
D: Thank you, Hugo.
C: POOL MAN
D: So, uh... if it doesn’t work out with the Valet, and you ever want to get a beer or something, my number’s on the bill.
N: He walks off, throwing his skimmer in the back of his truck. Olivia smiles at Amanda -- it’s working.

E: coyly
C: KATHRYN
D: Olivia and that guy are all over the tabloids.
C: GEORGE
D: Really?
C: KATHRYN
D: I feel silly, honey. I acted like a crazy person.
C: GEORGE
D: I’m just sorry you had to go through that. Must’ve been a real emotional rollercoaster.
N: George does a little victory dance, then:
C: KATHRYN
D: I just love you so much.
C: GEORGE
D: I love you so much.
C: KATHRYN
D: I have to run, but I’ll see you tonight for dinner.
N: She kisses him through the phone then hangs up. Then immediately makes another call.
S: INT. RANCHO PARK DRIVING RANGE - INTERCUT
N: Stegman hits a long drive, then answers his phone:
C: STEGMAN
D: Stegman.
C: KATHRYN
D: What do you got?
C: STEGMAN
D: Looks legit, ma’am. I sniffed around -- Ms. Allan’s even taking the Mexican dude to her premiere.
C: KATHRYN
D: There’s a lie here somewhere, we just haven’t found it yet.
S: EXT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
N: Antonio waits in a DESIGNER TUX, a fresh haircut, and NO MUSTACHE. He checks himself in the window of a dirty Nissan. He has to admit he looks pretty damn sharp. He shoots himself with some FINGER GUNS, a la Randy, then instantly regrets it. A LIMO pulls up.
C: LIMO DRIVER
D: Sorry, I’m late. I was sure I had the wrong address.
S: INT. LIMO - LATER
N: Antonio takes it all in -- TV, champagne, snacks, treats.
C: ANTONIO
D: How much are the peanuts?
C: LIMO DRIVER
D: They’re free, sir.
C: ANTONIO
D: And the Kit Kat bars?
C: LIMO DRIVER
D: Everything’s for your enjoyment.
N: Delighted, Antonio helps himself to one of everything. As he savors a bite of CANDY, the limo stops at a light...
S: EXT. STREET - INTERCUT
N: ...and Natalie pedals up next to them on her bike. She wears a backpack adorned with a “Reclaim Los Angeles” sticker. Antonio lowers his window.
C: ANTONIO
D: Hi, Natalie.
N: She turns, surprised to see Antonio in the back.
C: NATALIE
D: Holy shit -- so it’s true. All the metiches were gossiping about you and the famous movie star.
C: ANTONIO
D: Yes, I’m about to pick her up. I’m going to a premiere.
C: NATALIE
D: That’s just crazy. Makes me like her a little more.
N: The light changes and the limo drives off.
C: ANTONIO
D: See you later.
C: NATALIE
D: Have fun!
N: As the limo cruises down Pico, Antonio watches his neighborhood roll by from a new perspective. There’s LIFE EVERYWHERE -- taqueros grill carne asada on a cart, kids play soccer in a parking lot, a young Korean couple sip Slurpees on the hood of a car -- everything looks twenty percent more beautiful from the back of a luxury vehicle. They stop at the next light. Seconds later, Natalie rides up.
C: NATALIE
D: Hello again.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: This is what I always tell everyone -- bikes are just as fast as cars.
C: NATALIE
D: Right? Did you shave your mustache?
E: then
C: ANTONIO
D: What do you think?
C: NATALIE
D: I like it better.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’ve had a mustache for twenty years, why did nobody say anything?
N: The light changes, and the limo takes off again.
C: ANTONIO
D: See you at the next light!
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE - LATER
N: In the driveway, Antonio waits by the limo eating a BAG OF CHEX MIX. Olivia steps out, a vision of glamour and elegance.
C: ANTONIO
D: You look very nice.
C: OLIVIA
D: It only took an army of people twelve hours to assemble me.
N: She sizes him up -- he cleaned up better than she expected.
C: OLIVIA
D: Yeah, good -- this’ll work.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: I had to knock on every door in my building to find someone who could tie a bow tie. Turns out the new guy downstairs is a caterer.
N: He opens the door for her.
C: ANTONIO
D: I don’t need help with this part.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. LIMO - LATER
N: Antonio sits next to Olivia who is lying down on the seat talking on the phone.
C: OLIVIA
D: Of course I’m lying down to avoid wrinkles. I’m not an amatuer. What are the early reviews? No, I don’t want to know. Unless they’re good. No, no, don’t tell my anything. Unless they’re really, really good.
C: ANTONIO
D: Champagne? There’s no charge.
N: She holds out her glass and he pours.
C: OLIVIA
D: Yeah, he’s right here... My publicist. She’s worried you’re gonna say something stupid.
E: to Antonio
C: ANTONIO
D: Me too. I’m starting to sweat again.
C: OLIVIA
D: Oh, Jesus. Here, talk to him. Tell him to stop sweating.
E: then, into phone
N: Olivia puts her phone on speaker:
C: JENNIFER
D: Try not to say anything. They’ll mostly be focused on Olivia.
E: O.S.
C: ANTONIO
D: I don’t want to say anything.
C: OLIVIA
D: Good.
C: JENNIFER
D: But if you have to, just say something like you’re here to support Olivia on her big night.
E: O.S.
C: ANTONIO
D: Olivia. Big night.
N: Olivia grabs the phone back -- off speaker.
C: OLIVIA
D: How fast can you get us through the line?... God bless you.
N: She hangs up and downs an ATIVAN with the Cristal.
C: ANTONIO
D: Do you think that’s a good idea?
C: OLIVIA
D: I have a lot riding on this movie.
C: ANTONIO
D: It’s just we had Alcohol Awareness training at the restaurant and mixing medication and liquor is a flashing red light.
C: OLIVIA
D: That’s exactly the kind of thing you shouldn’t say tonight. Shit, I’m wrinkling.
E: then, noticing
N: She grabs the bottle and pours herself another.
S: EXT. FOX THEATER - LATER
N: BIG PREMIERE for “Earhart” -- klieg lights, screaming fans, paparazzi, reporters, the full circus. The LIMO door opens. Olivia steps onto the RED CARPET and the place goes wild. Olivia waves to the crowd as Antonio nervously follows behind her. Photographers spring into action. Cameras CLICK! Bulbs POP!
C: PHOTOGRAPHERS
D: Olivia, over here! Olivia!
N: She’s all charm, flashing her megawatt smile. Antonio stands frozen next to her, disoriented, blinded by all the flashes.

E: CONT'D
N: Olivia takes his arm, snuggling into him as they pose.
C: PHOTOGRAPHERS
D: Antonio! Over here! Antonio!

D: There’s America Sweethearts! Come on, the vultures are waiting.
N: CLOSE ON -- AN OLD TELEVISION As Olivia and Antonio get interviewed by NANCY O’DELL.

C: NANCY O’DELL
D: So, Antonio, is this your first premiere?
N: Antonio smiles and nods, trying to look natural. He does not.
C: NANCY O’DELL
D: Pretty exciting, right?
E: CONT'D
N: Antonio just keeps smiling and nodding.
C: CECILIA
D: What’s he doing? Why is he smiling like that?
C: MR. KIM
D: Why do you speak to me in Spanish, woman? I don’t speak Spanish. Do either of you speak Spanish?
E: in Korean to his grandchildren
C: KOREAN KID
D: Grandpa, we have no idea what you’re saying.
N: On the RED CARPET, Nancy O’Dell, having given up on Antonio, turns back to Olivia:
C: NANCY O’DELL
D: New movie. New company. This is a big year for you.
C: OLIVIA
D: Yeah, I’m just really thrilled to tell this inspiring story about this incredible woman...
N: As they continue talking, a reporter from Despierta America, ANA PATRICIA GAMEZ, approaches:
C: ANA PATRICIA
D: Antonio, our viewers love you.
C: ANTONIO
D: Ana Patricia? My mother watches you everyday.
N: Olivia tries to continue her interview, but is distracted by Antonio engaging with a reporter.
C: OLIVIA

C: ANA PATRICIA
D: What’re you wearing tonight?
C: ANTONIO
D: A tuxedo. It’s mine. I own it.

C: ANTONIO
D: I know you said you didn’t want anything, but it’s all free.
N: As the lights dim, Olivia surreptitiously pops another Ativan, then grabs a soda to wash it down.
S: INT. W HOTEL - LATER
N: The AFTER PARTY, elaborately decorated with a historic aviation theme -- prop planes, waitstaff with leather hats and goggles, etc... Amanda leads Olivia, with champagne, and Antonio to the VIP SECTION. As guests congratulate Olivia, Antonio looks around, astonished at how much money was spent on this event.
C: AMANDA
D: Here’s your table. I’ll get you more champagne. Antonio?
E: then
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m just here to support Olivia on her big night.
C: OLIVIA
D: Where was that on the red carpet?
N: As Amanda heads off, she passes a gorgeous ITALIAN MODEL and a hip FASHION DESIGNER, who check out Antonio.
C: ITALIAN MODEL
D: He’s not bad looking, but... what am I missing?
C: FASHION DESIGNER
D: Historically, the world’s greatest lovers have not been attractive men. Casanova was considered quite homely in his day but four centuries later, he still sets the sexual bar.
N: The model looks again at Antonio, her interest piqued. ANGLE ON: OLIVIA AND ANTONIO.
C: OLIVIA
D: We only need to stay for like twenty minutes, then-- Oh, shit. No. No. No. No.
E: noticing
N: ACROSS THE ROOM -- GEORGE and KATHRYN chat with the a STYLISH WOMAN in her 70s with big glasses.
C: ANTONIO
D: What?
C: OLIVIA
D: He’s here.
C: ANTONIO
D: Who’s here?
C: OLIVIA
D: With Kathryn.
C: ANTONIO
D: Who’s Kathryn?
C: OLIVIA
D: George’s wife.
C: ANTONIO
D: Who’s George?
C: OLIVIA
D: The married guy. My boyfriend. This was all explained to you.
C: ANTONIO
D: There were a lot of names. It was very confusing! Where are they?
C: OLIVIA
D: Over by the propeller ice sculpture. She doesn’t look depressed. Does she look depressed to you?
C: ANTONIO
D: Maybe a little sad around the eyes.
N: As the Stylish Woman escorts George and Kathryn towards them:
C: ANTONIO
D: They’re coming. Should I do something? Should I hold your hand?
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: Yes. No. I think so. I don’t know. Kiss me. Don’t kiss me.
N: Antonio takes her hand -- his support helps calm her down.
C: STYLISH WOMAN
D: Olivia, meet my dear friend, Kathryn Royce -- we’re on the board of the Red Cross together -- and her husband, George. This is Olivia Allan, and the famous Antonio.
N: Smiles all around -- hiding what’s really going on.
C: KATHRYN
D: We had to come over. We’ve seen all your movies.
C: OLIVIA
D: That’s so nice.
C: KATHRYN
D: But this one might be my favorite. Very empowering.
C: GEORGE
D: Honey, we shouldn’t monopolize her.
C: KATHRYN
D: The Actress and the Valet. I’m dying to know how you two met.
N: AT THE BUFFET Amanda sees -- George and Kathryn with Olivia. Uh-oh. She hurries over.
C: OLIVIA
D: Well, I got a flat tire in Beverly Hills and this handsome man pulls up in a Ferrari--
C: ANTONIO
D: The F8 Spider.
C: OLIVIA
D: --and by the time he had the spare on, I was smitten.
C: GEORGE
D: Love always finds its way. It was so nice meeting you both.
N: George tries to lead Kathryn off.
C: KATHRYN
D: Out of curiosity -- when did you find out he was just parking it?
N: Amanda swoops in.
C: AMANDA
D: Excuse me, I need to borrow these two.
C: OLIVIA
D: He told me right away. And thank God. I can’t stand guys who drive showy cars.
C: KATHRYN
D: Well, you’d never like George. He has a warehouse full of them.
N: Amanda rushes Olivia and Antonio off.
S: EXT. W HOTEL, STREET - LATER
N: Stegman sits in his car, staking-out the main entrance as limo drivers, paparazzi, and autograph hounds, mill about. A KNOCK. He looks up, sees Perez, and rolls down the window.
C: STEGMAN
D: Hey, a blast from the past. What’re you doing here?
C: PEREZ
D: You know, someone’s screwing someone they’re not supposed to. You?
C: STEGMAN
D: Same. Homo Sapiens, bro -- flawed creatures.
N: Perez hands him a take-out bag.
C: PEREZ
D: I got an extra falafel. You interested?
C: STEGMAN
D: From the Falafel King? Hell yes.
N: Stegman opens the bag.
C: PEREZ
D: Forgot napkins. You still keep a stash in the glove department?
C: STEGMAN
D: I upgraded to moist towelettes.
N: As Stegman reaches for the napkins, Perez surreptitiously plants an AUDIO BUGGING DEVICE under the seat. Unaware, Stegman sits back and takes a bite.
C: STEGMAN
D: Best falafel in the city. They never skimp on the tahini.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. W HOTEL, BATHROOM - LATER
N: Olivia, rummaging through her purse, talks to Amanda.
C: OLIVIA
D: Why would he bring her here? It doesn’t make any sense. And where the hell’s my Ativan?
C: AMANDA
D: In your hand.
N: As she pops a pill, George pokes his head in.
C: GEORGE
D: My apologies. I thought this was the men’s room.
C: OLIVIA
D: She knows.
N: George slips in -- locking the door behind him.
C: GEORGE
D: I’m sorry. Kathryn got the tickets. She sprung them on me last minute. I’m in hell.
C: AMANDA
D: I should wait outside, right?
C: OLIVIA
D: No. She’s nothing like you described. She’s regal and elegant and brings disaster relief to poor countries. Why would you divorce somebody like that?
E: to George
C: GEORGE
D: Because I’m in love with you. Because nothing I’ve ever done or said or felt makes any sense without you.
C: AMANDA
D: There’s a level of intimacy here that’s becoming uncomfortable for me.
C: OLIVIA
D: I had this whole narrative going in my head about how awful she was so I could justify my behavior, but--
C: GEORGE
D: She’s good at cocktail parties. She’s a monster at home. Come on, Olivia, we’re so close. She’s totally buying it.
N: He goes to kiss her, but she pushes him away.
C: OLIVIA
D: I can’t handle this right now.
N: As she storms out, he calls after her:
C: GEORGE
D: Your movie was amazing, by the way.
C: OLIVIA
D: You should’ve led with that.
N: Amanda and George, alone in the Ladies Room, awkwardly look at each other.
C: AMANDA
D: This is not what I thought this job was gonna be.
S: INT. W HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER
N: Antonio stands near the kitchen. As servers pass by with appetizers, he takes one from every tray, politely saying “thank you” as he neatly places them on his plate. A party guest, thinking Antonio’s a waiter, walks by and takes a mini mushroom tart off his plate.
C: ANTONIO
D: Actually, I’m not the-- I recommend the crab cakes.
E: then
N: Then Antonio sees -- Olivia, across the room, grab a bottle of champagne off the bar. Yikes. He starts after her but Kathryn stops him.
C: KATHRYN
D: Whatever my husband’s paying you, I’ll double it. I’ll quadruple it.
N: Oh, shit.
C: ANTONIO
D: I... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
C: KATHRYN
D: How long do we have to play this game? I’ll give you a hundred thousand dollars.
C: ANTONIO
D: Excuse me?
C: KATHRYN
D: Cash.
N: Antonio takes a breath -- that’s a lot of dough.
C: KATHRYN
D: There’s no way Olivia Allan’s wasting her time with a valet.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: Ma’am, I don’t get paid a lot -- although tips are pretty good on the weekends -- so I’d love to take your money but I can’t. I know it’s hard to believe but maybe Olivia isn’t as superficial as you are.
E: MORE
C: ANTONIO
D: And maybe you’ve underestimated the passion and charisma of a Latin man. Buenas noches.
E: CONT'D
N: Antonio, surprised by his own eloquence, walks off. Kathryn watches him go -- is it possible they really are a couple?
S: INT. W HOTEL - LATER
N: In a QUIET STAIRWELL, Olivia, intoxicated, rests her head on the empty champagne bottle. Antonio rushes in.
C: ANTONIO
D: You okay?
C: OLIVIA
D: One too many Ativans. Five too many champagnes. I want to go home now.
N: She stands -- but she’s too woozy, and STUMBLES back down.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’ll call the limo.
C: OLIVIA
D: No. No drunk Olivia pictures. Women’s stories.
S: INT. W HOTEL, KITCHEN - LATER
N: Olivia leans on Antonio, as they make their way through the maze of activity passing DISHWASHERS, COOKS, and BUSBOYS.
C: DISHWASHER
D: Hey, it’s Antonio the valet!
C: COOK
D: The legend!
N: The kitchen staff applaud.
C: ANTONIO
D: The food’s very delicious. Thank you for all your hard work.
S: EXT. W HOTEL - LOADING DOCK - LATER
N: Antonio helps Olivia out the back door.
C: OLIVIA
D: I was a pastry chef in a movie. Pofiteroles. Plofiteroles. Profliteroles.
N: A tricked-out PICK-UP TRUCK screeches to a stop -- Javier and Rudy in the front cab. Noticing his suit:
C: RUDY
D: You clean up nice, bro. Is that one of Chucho’s?
C: JAVIER
D: Hurry up, they profile in this neighborhood.
N: Rudy hops out, and together they maneuver Olivia into...
S: INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
N: ...the back. As Antonio climbs in next to Olivia, she slowly topples over onto the seat, passed-out.
C: RUDY
D: Whoa, shit!
C: JAVIER
D: Is she dead?
C: ANTONIO
D: She’s not dead. She just drank too much and took a few pills.
C: RUDY
D: That’s a flashing red light. Weren’t you at the seminar?
C: ANTONIO
D: I know!
C: JAVIER
D: I can’t be in a truck where some rich white lady OD’s.
C: ANTONIO
D: She’s not gonna OD!
N: A LINEN TRUCK pulls into the alleyway.
C: JAVIER
D: Shit. We gotta get out of here.
N: Antonio gently tries to rouse Olivia.
C: ANTONIO
D: Olivia. We need your address.
C: OLIVIA
D: Glass. View. Mountains.
C: ANTONIO
D: Olivia. Please, wake up.
C: OLIVIA
D: Take a right at Sylvester Stallone’s house.
N: But then she falls back asleep.
C: JAVIER
D: Guey! Now! I’m not going back to Matehuala!
C: ANTONIO
D: Just take her to my place.
S: EXT. W HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER
N: Paparazzi and fans wait for celebrities. The PICK-UP TRUCK drives by, unnoticed -- with seemingly only Rudy in the car.
S: INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
N: Rudy looks in his rearview mirror.
C: RUDY
D: All clear, guys.
N: Antonio and Javier pop their heads back up.
C: JAVIER
D: Okay, keep it at thirty-five, and use your signal.
C: RUDY
D: Is anyone else hungry?
C: JAVIER
D: No. Are you insane? No stops!
S: EXT. ARBY’S ROAST BEEF - A LITTLE LATER
N: The truck idles in the DRIVE THRU LINE. Rudy orders, yelling into the speaker.
C: RUDY
D: Two Beef ‘n’ Cheddars, a curly fry and, uh... what to drink, what to drink?
C: JAVIER
D: Make a decision! We look like kidnappers!
C: ANTONIO
D: He has blood sugar issues. You know that.
C: RUDY
D: Thank you. You guys sure you don’t want anything? We’re here.
C: ANTONIO
D: Get me a Buttermilk Crispy Chicken. And lots of packets of mayo and mustard. I’m out at home.
C: RUDY
D: Should we get anything for her?
C: ANTONIO
D: No, she doesn’t eat.
C: JAVIER
D: And she’s passed out! Can we please get out of here?!
C: RUDY
D: Last chance, Javy. I’m not sharing.
C: JAVIER
D: Fine, a Beef ‘n’ Cheddar. And some Mozzarella sticks.
N: Olivia wakes up.
C: OLIVIA
D: Hi, guys.
N: They all react, startled.
C: ANTONIO
D: Ahh! Olivia -- you’re up. These are my friends, Javy and Rudy.
C: OLIVIA
D: You’re cute, Rudy. Want to go out with my assistant? She’s prettier than she thinks she is.
C: ANTONIO
D: We need to know where you live so--
N: But -- she passes out again. Rudy shrugs and orders:
C: RUDY
D: Okay, three beef ‘n’ cheddars. One Buttermilk Chicken. A curly fry. Mozzarella sticks. A vanilla shake.
C: ANTONIO
D: And as much mayo and mustard as you can give us.
C: CASHIER
D: That’ll be twenty-seven fifty. Pay at the window.
E: O.S.
N: Rudy drives up, then turns to the guys.
C: RUDY
D: Okay, fellas -- nine bucks each.
N: Each valet pulls out a ROLL OF TIP MONEY and peels off nine singles.
S: EXT. ANTONIO'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Carrying a groggy Olivia, Antonio shuts the truck door.
C: ANTONIO
D: I owe you guys.
C: RUDY
D: Yeah, so find out -- if that was a real offer, I’d totally go out with her assistant. Maybe the four of us could go on a hike or something. Low key, no stress.
C: JAVIER
D: Work out the details later! Get inside! This is not a good look!
E: re: drunk Olivia
N: Antonio starts up the stairs as they drive away.
S: INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Cecilia, on the couch, watches a movie DUBBED IN SPANISH. The door opens and Antonio, with Olivia in his arms, enters. As he carries her across the living room:
C: ANTONIO
D: Hi, Mama -- this is Olivia.
C: OLIVIA
D: Hi, Mama.
C: CECILIA
D: I want to remind you the walls are very thin. I can hear everything.
C: ANTONIO
D: We’re just going to sleep.
C: CECILIA
D: You’re a grown man -- do what you want. But the walls are very thin.
N: Antonio and Olivia disappear down the hall.
S: INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Antonio carries Olivia to the bed. As soon as he puts her down, she starts UNZIPPING her dress.
C: OLIVIA
D: Sleep.
C: ANTONIO
D: No, no! Dress stays on. You’re sleeping in your clothes.
N: He ZIPS her back up, but then she yanks the dress off over her head...
C: ANTONIO
D: No, no, please!
E: CONT'D
N: ...REVEALING an elaborate NUDE BODYSUIT with lots of body tape and other tricks of the trade, holding all the various parts in place. There’s nothing sexy about it.
C: ANTONIO
D: Alright. We’re good.
E: CONT'D
N: She plops onto the bed and instantly FALLS ASLEEP. Antonio gently places the comforter over her.
S: INT. ANTONIO'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Antonio quietly steps out of his room.
C: CECILIA
D: Son. Come sit with me.
N: Antonio joins her on the couch as she mutes the TV.
C: CECILIA
D: It took me forty-eight years after your dad died to find love again.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: With Mr. Kim? You’re calling that love now?
C: CECILIA
D: Ha-Joon. That’s his name. I missed out on a lot of living. I’m glad to see you’re not making the same mistake.
C: ANTONIO
D: It’s more complicated than--
C: CECILIA
D: Don’t make it complicated. Isabel’s the mother of my grandson -- I love her -- but she’s acting like an idiot.
C: ANTONIO
D: She’s just going through--
C: CECILIA
D: No. You’re a great person and if she can’t see that... well, I’m glad you’re moving on.
C: ANTONIO
D: Mama--
C: CECILIA
D: Change is good, Antonio, even if you don’t know why when it happens. I like this actress. Would’ve been happier if she was Mexican, but she seems nice in the movies. I’ve said my piece.
E: then
N: She UNMUTES THE TV. As Antonio sits back to watch with his mom, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small box:
C: ANTONIO
D: Junior Mint?
S: INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
N: Sunlight pours through the curtains on a hungover Olivia in bed. Her eyes slowly open. She looks around. Where am I? She sees Antonio asleep on a beat-up old barcalounger.
C: OLIVIA
D: Oh, God.
N: As quietly as possible, she sits up, grabs her phone from her purse and starts scrolling through texts.
C: ANTONIO
D: Good morning.
E: O.S.
C: OLIVIA
D: Hi.
E: embarrassed
C: ANTONIO
D: I want you to know nothing happened. I didn’t even look. And I slept in my pants.
C: OLIVIA
D: Thanks for taking care of me -- last night was not my finest performance.
C: ANTONIO
D: You would’ve done the same for me.
C: OLIVIA
D: I’d like to think so, but probably not. What’s your address so I can tell my assistant?
C: ANTONIO
D: 1285 Valencia. South Valencia. If they go to North Valencia -- it’s a batting cage.
N: As Olivia TEXTS her assistant:
C: OLIVIA
D: And what about a coffee place? Is there one near here?
C: ANTONIO
D: I could make you a cup of coffee.
C: OLIVIA
D: Any chance you have almond milk?
C: ANTONIO
D: No chance.
N: She stands and the full force of her HANGOVER hits her.
C: ANTONIO
D: I do have aspirin.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Antonio and Olivia, back in her dress, step out of the bedroom to find -- Fifteen STARSTRUCK MEXICANS, MR. KIM and a five or six of his Korean relatives -- all smiling at them. They prepared an elaborate FEAST -- chilaquiles, chorizo and eggs, pan dulce, as well as kimchi and bibimbap.
C: ANTONIO
D: Mama!
C: CECILIA
D: I told one person. Maybe two.
C: ANTONIO
D: Sorry about this. My sister, Clara. You met Benny. My nephews, Dante and Luca. Mr. Kim, my landlord, and I’m assuming, his family.
E: to Olivia then, introducing
C: MR. KIM
D: Picture?
E: holds up his phone
C: CLARA
D: Wasn’t gonna ask, but if we’re doing pictures, I want in on that too.
C: ANTONIO
D: My Tia, Laura. My cousins and... these people I’ve never seen before.
C: OLIVIA
D: Nice to meet you all.
C: CLARA
D: You must be hungry, Olivia. I’ll make you a plate.
C: ANTONIO
D: She just wants a coffee. Can we not make this a big deal?
C: CECILIA
D: Don’t deprive me of this.
N: Cecilia brings coffee as Benny holds up some sweet breads.
C: BENNY
D: Got to try one of these conchas. Drove all the way out to Alhambra.
C: OLIVIA
D: Actually, I should get going.
C: BENNY
D: I’m just gonna cut you a little square. You’ll thank me.
N: He does, and hands it to her.
C: ANTONIO
D: You don’t have to eat anything you don’t want to.
N: Outraged, they jump all over Antonio:
C: EVERYONE
D: She looks hungry. / This food is delicious. / I drove all the way out to Alhambra! / She’s a guest.
C: OLIVIA
D: It’s probably good for me to put something in my stomach anyway. Wow, that’s really delicious.
E: takes a bite
C: BENNY
D: Right? Try dipping it in the coffee.
N: Dante and Luca show a photo on their iPad to a couple Korean kids, WHISPERING:
C: DANTE
D: Pretty sure these are her boobs.
C: CLARA
D: You said you’d leave that in the car! Turn it off, Monstro! Now!
N: Once again, they ignore her. Clara turns back to Olivia:
C: CLARA
D: We’re really excited for your movie. Been reading about it everywhere.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: Don’t tell me what they’re saying. I’ve stopped looking at reviews -- they really mess with your head.
C: BENNY
D: Tell me about it. I got a bad one on Yelp once. Still keeps me up at night. “Left the car smelling like a Russian Bowling League.” What’s that even supposed to mean?
N: A KNOCK. Antonio opens the door to find Isabel and Marco.
C: ANTONIO
D: Hi. Thought I didn’t have Marco until the weekend.
C: ISABEL
D: He forgot his math book again.
N: As Marco rushes in, Isabel sees Olivia. She tries to hide it, but she’s flustered.
C: ISABEL
D: Oh, sorry, didn’t know you had company -- Marco, I’ll be in the car.
E: CONT'D
N: Isabel leaves. Antonio, upset, heads to his bedroom.
C: ANTONIO
D: I need to go to work.
S: INT. ANTONIO'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Antonio enters and sits on the bed, putting his head in his hands. Olivia gently knocks.
C: OLIVIA
D: Was that your ex or something?
C: ANTONIO
D: We’re separated. I’ve been trying to get her back but now she sees me with you and I’ve blown it.
C: OLIVIA
D: You don’t know that.
C: ANTONIO
D: I look like a playboy.
C: OLIVIA
D: Who broke up with who?
C: ANTONIO
D: She broke up with me.
C: OLIVIA
D: You didn’t blow it. Trust me.
N: Antonio’s phone buzzes with a TEXT.
C: ANTONIO
D: Isabel.
N: Olivia smiles -- “I told you so.”
C: ANTONIO
D: She needs me to sign some field trip form.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: I guarantee you there’s no field trip.
S: EXT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Antonio and Isabel talk on the balcony.
C: ISABEL
D: I feel a little blindsided. I mean, I told you about Randy, and that’s not even that serious--
C: ANTONIO
D: Don’t you need me to sign something?
C: ISABEL
D: No! It’s not for weeks. I mean, I’m happy for you. It’s great. You’re moving on which is great.
E: then
C: ANTONIO
D: It’s not what you--
C: ISABEL
D: I mean, I guess I’m the one who said we should date other people so I’m glad that you’re dating other people. Which is good. So good. I mean, do you love-- No, forget it. Are you going to the Oscars? I don’t want to know. Tell Marco to hurry up.
N: She turns and rushes off. Antonio SMILES to himself -- maybe Olivia was right, then...
S: INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: ...steps back inside to find Marco chatting with Olivia who’s enjoying a second concha, dipping it in her coffee.
C: MARCO
D: ...yeah, so we’re doing Midsummer Night’s Dream. I’d love if you could come. I’m Lysander.
C: OLIVIA
D: Ooh, one of the lovers. That’s a great part.
C: MARCO
D: I think I found a new way in. I’m playing him like he has a secret.
C: ANTONIO
D: Marco, she’s not going to a high school production of Shakespeare.
C: BENNY
D: Unabridged.
C: CLARA
D: No one asked you, Cerdito.
C: BENNY
D: Just thought she should have all the information. Two and half hours, not counting intermission.
C: ANTONIO
D: Your mom’s waiting for you.
C: MARCO
D: Okay, okay -- bye, everyone. Fingers crossed, we both have big openings this weekend.
E: to Olivia
N: Marco dashes out as Olivia’s phone BUZZES.
C: OLIVIA
D: My assistant -- I should go, too.
C: CLARA
D: Let me make you a care package.
C: OLIVIA
D: That’s so nice, but--
C: CECILIA
D: Give her some food! Why is no one giving her food?!
C: ANTONIO
D: Don’t fight it. No one walks out of here empty-handed.
S: EXT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Antonio and Olivia, holding a tinfoil CARE PACKAGE, head down the stairs. Family and friends huddle in the doorway, waving and taking pictures.
C: FAMILY
D: Bye, bye./Warm the conchas before you eat them./They’re from Alhambra.
C: ANTONIO
D: Sorry again. There’s no word for “boundaries” in Spanish.
C: OLIVIA
D: I liked it. I don’t see my family that much.
N: They reach the SIDEWALK.
C: ANTONIO
D: And you’re right. Isabel’s jealous.
C: OLIVIA
D: Maybe we’ll both get what we want out of this craziness.
N: Amanda pulls up to the curb.
C: AMANDA
D: Sorry, Waze took me to a batting cage.

C: KATHRYN
D: She really spent the night? In the barrio?
N: Blanca arrives with a tray of iced tea and a bowl of cherries. Kathryn hands her the MINI-RECORDER and whispers:
C: KATHRYN
D: Just a few things.
E: CONT'D

N: George hits the button. Daniel slips in before the door closes. As they go up:
C: DANIEL
D: A few shareholders are resisting the buyout. I’m going to need more time.
C: GEORGE
D: Doesn’t matter. I’ve decided not to divorce Kathryn.
C: DANIEL
D: Really? Why the change of heart?
C: GEORGE
D: I couldn’t sleep last night. I poured myself a scotch and did some soul searching. What kind of man do I want to be? And then I realized -- rich. Rich and powerful is the kind of man I want to be.
C: DANIEL
D: I admire your honesty.
N: The doors open...
S: INT. ROYCE TOWER, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: They walk and talk, passing a JANITOR emptying trash cans.
C: GEORGE
D: What was I thinking? Juggling two women at a premiere like I’m Leonardo DiCaprio. When I was in business school I dreamed of one thing -- becoming a CEO of a vast real estate empire. Why would I risk that for what might be a passing fancy?
S: INT. ROYCE TOWER, GEORGE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: They head in.
C: GEORGE
D: Sure, Olivia’s intoxicating now, but who knows how I’ll feel in a few months?
N: Daniel’s phone RINGS. He looks at the caller ID.
C: DANIEL
D: It’s Perez.
N: George grabs the phone.
C: GEORGE
D: What do you got?... Spectacular. Kathryn called off the dogs.
E: to Daniel
C: DANIEL
D: Congratulations. You got away scot- free.
C: GEORGE
D: Out of curiosity, what was the turning point?... What?! She spent the night with him! That dirty little homunculus.
E: into phone to Daniel
C: DANIEL
D: Important thing is your empire’s still intact.
C: GEORGE
D: No one asked you. Perez, listen to me. Hire a second detective. I want someone following her. I want someone following him. Full saturation coverage.
E: into phone
C: DANIEL
D: But you’ve moved on. Why would you do that?

D: It’s eating at me. Are you some kind of sex god, Antonio?
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m not a sex god.
C: BENNY
D: I had a dog when I was a kid -- he gave off a scent or something, made the girl dogs crazy. Maybe you got something like that.
N: Javier notices the stunning ITALIAN MODEL from the premiere leaving with some friends.
C: JAVIER
D: Hey, know that billboard on Doheny?
C: RUDY
D: The hottie with the fur boots?
C: JAVIER
D: I think that’s her.
N: As they sneak a look, the Model strolls over to Antonio, slips him her card, and whispers in his ear:
C: ITALIAN MODEL
D: If things don’t work out with Olivia, give me a call.
N: She gives him a kiss on the cheek and walks off, leaving the valets’ minds blown once again. Benny turns to Antonio:

N: Jennifer, the publicist, on her phone, waits to take off.
C: JENNIFER
D: How great were those reviews?!
C: OLIVIA
D: Except for Liz Pembrooke of the Chicago Sun Times. I wonder how she’d feel hearing that her sexuality seems forced. But I’m not gonna dwell on that. She always hates me. Let’s go drink too much!
C: JENNIFER
D: I wish. On my way to Miami. My sister’s getting married. Again. But I’m taking you for margaritas as soon as I get back.
C: OLIVIA
D: Okay. Great.
N: She hangs up. She dances, a little less enthusiastically this time, and scrolls through her phone again, singing:
C: OLIVIA
D: They love my movie, who should I call, who should I call...
E: CONT'D
S: INT. BRENTWOOD MANSION - LATER
N: George and Kathryn host a small cocktail party. George holds court with the other rich and powerful:
C: GEORGE
D: ...and there’s some woman with a bike shop firing up the natives. Honestly, I don’t know how gentrification got to be such a bad word. I mean, who doesn’t want a SoulCycle in their neighborhood?
N: George’s phone RINGS. He checks the caller ID -- “DENTIST.”
C: GEORGE
D: Excuse me. Scheduling issues.
E: CONT'D
N: He steps outside...

S: INT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - INTERCUT (N5)
N: Olivia on the phone.
C: OLIVIA
D: My movie’s a big hit. I talked to my agent -- there’re three more bidders for my company. It’s all happening. Everything we dreamed of.
C: GEORGE
D: Where were you last night?
C: OLIVIA
D: What?! I want to be with you. I want to celebrate with the man I love.
C: GEORGE
D: You heard me. Where were you?
N: He notices Blanca hovering nearby. He quickly cups the phone:

D: Blanca, what is it?
E: CONT'D
C: BLANCA
D: Mrs. Royce says time for your toast.
C: GEORGE
D: I gotta go.
E: into the phone
N: He hangs up. Olivia sighs, disappointed:
C: OLIVIA
D: They love my movie.
S: EXT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: She’s ALL ALONE in her beautiful, lit-up, glass box. Only the sound of crickets, and oddly, Golf Talk on Sirius radio. PULL BACK to REVEAL Stegman watching from his parked car.
S: INT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Olivia, feeling sorry for herself, grabs wine from the fridge. She closes the door, but stops when she sees -- The Pan Dulce CARE PACKAGE from Antonio’s family. She smiles to herself, wistful.
S: INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATER
N: In the THEATER/GYM, a mix of mostly Latinx and Korean high- school kids gamely put on “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”

E: AS HERMIA
N: IN THE AUDIENCE, Antonio watches with Clara, Benny, Cecilia, and Mr. Kim.
C: MARCO
D: “O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!”
E: AS LYSANDER
N: Antonio smiles -- proud of his boy. He turns to share the moment with Isabel across the aisle, but-- RANDY THE REALTOR (45, strong chin, lotta linen), sitting next to her, notices Antonio and gives him his SIGNATURE FINGER GUNS, killing his mood. FROM A SIDE DOOR, Olivia slips in, dressed casually with her hair pulled back. Clara excitedly waves her over, scooting everyone down to make room. As Olivia sits next to Antonio:
C: OLIVIA
D: Hope it’s okay I came.
C: ANTONIO
D: Marco’s gonna be so happy.
N: Isabel, distracted by Olivia, barely watches the play. IN A BACK ROW, Stegman squeezes down the aisle and sits next to Perez, who offers him a Starburst and whispers:
C: PEREZ
D: The king’s overacting, but the donkey’s hilarious.
S: INT. PIZZA PLACE, COURTYARD - LATER
N: The CAST PARTY. A charming PATIO with twinkling lights. A DJ plays music for a multi-generational crowd. Marco pumps Olivia for feedback as his family looks on.
C: MARCO
D: You’re not just saying that ‘cause you have to?
C: OLIVIA
D: No, you completely became the character. When you got back with Hermia...
C: CLARA
D: Who’s adorable, by the way.
C: OLIVIA ...I got choked up.
D: Can I get you to sign my program?
E: then
C: MARCO
D: I know you’re just being nice, but hell yeah.
N: As Marco grabs a pen and writes an inscription:
C: BENNY
D: It was good. It was long -- but it was good.
C: ANTONIO
D: I still can’t believe you got up in front of all those people. My son... ...I’m so proud.
E: tapping his heart
C: MARCO
D: Okay, we get it. You’re my dad. You think I’m great. I need to go give Mom equal time.
E: getting up
N: Antonio watches Marco walk over to Isabel where Randy balances a spoon on his nose to the delight of everyone at the table. As Antonio’s heart sinks, Clara turns to Olivia.
C: CLARA
D: I got to ask. What do you see in my brother?
C: BENNY
D: Elephant in the room, right there.
C: OLIVIA
D: Um, well... that’s a tough question. What do you see in Benny?
C: CLARA
D: I don’t remember.
N: Cecilia laughs.
C: BENNY
D: What’re you laughing at? You don’t even speak English.
C: ANTONIO
D: Can we just change the subject?
C: OLIVIA
D: No, I want to answer. Obviously he’s handsome.
C: ANTONIO
D: Please continue.
C: OLIVIA
D: But what makes your brother special... is...
N: She stops for a moment to really look at him.
C: OLIVIA
D: ...he’s decent. And kind. And he’s not pretending to be someone he’s not. I admire that.
E: CONT'D smiling at Antonio
N: They all take this in, then:
C: BENNY
D: We’re the last of a dying breed.
N: Mr. Kim whispers in Korean to his 25 year-old GRANDDAUGHTER.
C: GRANDDAUGHTER
D: My grandfather would like to thank you for including us in this festive occasion.
E: MORE
C: GRANDDAUGHTER
D: And though he did not understand any of the words, he thought the production was top-notch.
E: CONT'D
N: Mr. Kim whispers some more.
C: GRANDDAUGHTER
D: He’d also like to tell Cecilia she looks especially beautiful tonight.
E: CONT'D
N: Antonio turns to his mother:
C: ANTONIO
D: He liked the play and says you’re pretty. Anything you want to say to Mr. Kim? Now’s your chance.
C: CECILIA
D: Tell him he doesn’t have to be so gentle. I would like it if he pulled my hair once in a while.
C: ANTONIO
D: She says he looks very handsome, as well.
N: As Clara stifles a laugh, BLANCA approaches:
C: BLANCA
D: Antonio, our children were amazing! That was just an excuse to meet you.
E: turns to Olivia
C: ANTONIO
D: This is Blanca. Hermia’s mom.
C: OLIVIA
D: Oh my God, she’s a natural. You must be so proud. Sit down, join us.
C: BLANCA
D: I don’t want to intrude, but could I get a picture?
C: OLIVIA
D: Let’s do it.
N: Olivia stands and puts her arm around Blanca who waves her entire family over. Four generations of Guatemalans gather for a group shot as Antonio snaps photos.
C: BLANCA
D: My church group’s gonna shit themselves when I post these.
N: The DJ cues a rockin’ old-school MEXICAN CUMBIA.
C: DJ
D: Here’s one for the parents.
N: Cecilia starts to drag Mr. Kim on to the dance floor.
C: ANTONIO
D: Mom, try not to overexert yourself -- your heart.
C: CECILIA
D: Try not to be such a wet blanket.
N: As Benny and Clara join them, Benny offers his hand to Olivia.
C: BENNY
D: You’re coming too -- let’s see what you got.
C: OLIVIA
D: A lot less than you think. Really nice meeting you, Blanca.
E: then
N: As they all head off, Blanca whispers to Antonio:
C: BLANCA
D: You’re girlfriend’s very sweet.
N: She WINKS at Antonio.
C: ANTONIO
D: Did you just wink at me?
C: BLANCA
D: I work for Mr. Royce. I do his laundry. You learn things.
C: ANTONIO
D: Please don’t tell anyone.
C: BLANCA
D: Your secret’s safe. She deserves way better.
E: then
N: ON THE DANCE FLOOR, Olivia gets down with Benny, Clara, Cecilia, Mr. Kim as well as Marco and Sofia.
C: BLANCA
D: I think my daughter has the hots for your son.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: I think it’s very mutual.
S: INT. PIZZA PLACE, COURTYARD - LATER
N: AT THE BAR, Natalie pays for a round as Antonio steps up with the empty pitcher.
C: ANTONIO
D: Natalie, what’re you doing here?
C: NATALIE
D: Bunch of us were out canvasing -- we’re having another demonstration tomorrow. Whatever we can do before the council meeting.
C: ANTONIO
D: How’s it looking?
C: NATALIE
D: Not good, that’s why we’re here -- tequila therapy.
N: She downs a shot.
C: NATALIE
D: Know what I’m going to miss most? Customers like you.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: Hey -- your Spanish.
C: NATALIE
D: It’s better when I drink.
N: She kisses him on the cheek and heads off. ACROSS THE BAR, Benny, having witnessed this, bows to the master.
S: EXT. PIZZA PLACE - LATER
N: The green Yaris idles in the loading zone across the street.
C: STEGMAN
D: So, you ever remarry?
E: O.S.
S: INT. STEGMAN’S CAR - SAME TIME
N: Perez and Stegman eat pizza, keeping an eye on the party.
C: PEREZ
D: Twice. And both times it was gonna be different. You?
C: STEGMAN
D: Three times. World’s most expensive hat trick. Right now, I’m living at my brother’s.
C: PEREZ
D: Got your own room?
C: STEGMAN
D: The seven year-old’s trundle. SpongeBob blanket.
C: PEREZ
D: I’ve slept on worse.
S: INT. PIZZA PLACE, QUIET HALLWAY - LATER
N: Antonio steps out of the restroom. Isabel appears out of nowhere and pins him against the wall.
C: ISABEL
D: I can’t stop thinking about you!
N: She KISSES him.
C: ANTONIO
D: What about Randy?
C: ISABEL
D: Randy’s a buffoon. How serious are you and Olivia? Do I have a chance?
C: ANTONIO
D: Yes. Very much.
C: ISABEL
D: You’d leave a famous actress for me?
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m not supposed to tell anyone, but we’re not really dating.
C: ISABEL
D: What?
C: ANTONIO
D: It’s all pretend. Olivia’s having an affair with some billionaire.
C: ISABEL
D: You’re not a couple?
C: ANTONIO
D: No. The whole thing’s made up so no one finds out.
C: ISABEL
D: You were never a couple?
C: ANTONIO
D: No. The guy’s lawyer shows up and offers me money and then the guy’s wife offers me even more money.
C: ISABEL
D: How much more?
C: ANTONIO
D: A hundred thousand dollars. Rich people -- they’re crazy.
C: ISABEL
D: You got a hundred thousand dollars?!
C: ANTONIO
D: No, I already gave my word to the other guy. But here’s the best part, I was gonna surprise you with--
C: RANDY
D: Hey -- anyone seen my lady?
E: O.S.
C: ISABEL
D: Shit, Randy! I’ll call you later.
N: She gives him one last kiss and runs off.
S: INT. PIZZA PLACE, COURTYARD - LATER
N: Antonio, smiling big, returns to the party. Marco approaches.
C: MARCO
D: I’m walking Sofia home. Mom knows. Don’t be weird.
E: off Antonio’s grin
N: Marco rushes off, Antonio sits at the table next to Benny.
C: BENNY
D: Check out the old folks.
N: On the DANCE FLOOR Cecilia slow dances with Mr. Kim, in love. Antonio watches, touched by how happy his mom seems.
C: BENNY
D: I can’t remember the last time I danced with your sister like that.
E: CONT'D
N: Clara overhears as she walks by:
C: CLARA
D: Your cousin’s wedding. 2004.
C: BENNY
D: Under duress. So listen, I’m putting in a bid to take over the parking at Vine Street Grill.
E: then, to Antonio
C: ANTONIO
D: How many restaurants would that make? Four? You’re a big shot.
C: BENNY
D: Not breaking out the good scotch yet -- still haggling over garage fees -- but if it works out, I thought you could be my guy on the ground. Create some kind of management position.
C: ANTONIO
D: You want to promote me?
C: BENNY
D: Obviously I underestimated you.
N: Before he can respond, Olivia walks up.
C: OLIVIA
D: I should get going. Walk me to my car?
C: BENNY
D: You got some kind of magic sauce, Antonio -- mull it over.
S: INT. STEGMAN’S CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Stegman hits Perez.
C: STEGMAN
D: We’re up!
N: THEIR POV -- Olivia and Antonio step out of the restaurant.
S: EXT. PIZZA PLACE - CONTINUOUS
N: As Antonio unlocks his bike, Olivia spots Perez getting out of the green Yaris and hurrying to his car.
C: OLIVIA
D: I’m getting sick of these guys.
C: ANTONIO
D: Wanna mess with them?
C: OLIVIA
D: I do.
C: ANTONIO
D: Hop on.
N: She sits behind him and holds on tightly as Antonio pedals down Alvarado. The two detectives follow in their cars at a safe distance -- a hot pursuit at eight miles an hour.
C: ANTONIO
D: Okay, now turn and wave.
E: CONT'D
N: She does, and Antonio makes a right between two buildings. The detectives pull up to the spot -- no way their cars can fit through the tight passageway.
S: INT. STEGMAN’S CAR / INT. PEREZ’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Both on speaker:
C: PEREZ
D: Shit. Where does it lead?
C: STEGMAN
D: Probably empties out on Westlake.
C: PEREZ
D: Let’s cut through the Pep Boys.
N: But before they can drive off --
S: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: Antonio and Olivia cruise by, smiling.
C: ANTONIO
D: Vete a freir pinas!
C: OLIVIA
D: What does that mean?
N: Perez and Stegman follow.
C: ANTONIO
D: Technically, “Go fry pineapples.” But really it’s just a fun way to say, “Go fuck yourself.”
C: OLIVIA
D: Yeah, go fuck some pineapples!
E: laughing
N: Antonio takes a left into an ALLEY. So do the detectives -- only to find a DEAD END. Antonio and Olivia slip though a pedestrian walkway.
S: INT. STEGMAN’S CAR / INT. PEREZ’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
C: STEGMAN
D: Reverse! Reverse!
S: EXT. STREET - INTERCUT
N: Perez pulls out onto the boulevard, Stegman right behind.
C: STEGMAN
D: Should we split up?
C: PEREZ
D: No.
C: STEGMAN
D: Why not?
C: PEREZ
D: ‘Cause here they come again.
N: THRU THE WINDSHIELD, Antonio and Olivia pedal down the middle of the street towards them. As they ride by:
C: ANTONIO
D: Last time, we promise.
C: OLIVIA
D: Vete a freir pinas!
N: Antonio turns off the street, steers down a small grass embankment and they disappear into the night, laughing.
S: EXT. MACARTHUR PARK - LATER
N: Antonio buys paletas (popsicles) from a CART VENDOR and hands one to Olivia. As they walk:
C: OLIVIA
D: You know I’ve lived in LA since I was sixteen and I’ve never been here. It’s beautiful.
C: ANTONIO
D: Don’t go on the other side of the lake. That’s where the junkies are.
C: OLIVIA
D: I feel like people don’t recognize me here.
C: ANTONIO
D: No one expects to see a famous actress in MacArthur Park eating Mexican popsicles -- you got the night off.
C: OLIVIA
D: It’s kinda nice being invisible.
C: ANTONIO
D: It gets old.
N: They find an empty bench on a hill.
C: ANTONIO
D: Guess what? Isabel wants me back.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: I’m not gonna say I told you so, but... I told you. So.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m really happy.
N: They watch the park life -- soccer, parties, children, parents, grandparents -- a Latinx BAND plays a free concert.
C: OLIVIA
D: It’s pretty late, right? Don’t these kids have a bedtime?
C: ANTONIO
D: It’s only 10:30. Gringos take their sleep way too seriously.
C: OLIVIA
D: I used to come with my parents to a park like this every Fourth of July. Before they got divorced. Those are some of my best memories and I was still in bed by eight.
N: He laughs.
C: ANTONIO
D: Where’d you grow up?
C: OLIVIA
D: Bakersfield. Gateway to Fresno.
C: ANTONIO
D: It’s nice your family’s close by.
C: OLIVIA
D: My dad disappeared and I haven’t talked to my mom in twenty years.
C: ANTONIO
D: Twenty years? That’s impossible.
C: OLIVIA
D: She did some really shitty things
C: when I got famous.
D: Heard she finally got sober. She’s called a few times. Left some messages, trying to apologize. The sick thing -- she’d be proud I’m starting a company, but... I just can’t.
E: then
C: ANTONIO
D: I have an aunt who stabbed my uncle. Still comes over every Christmas. She sits right next to him. With a big scar on his neck.
N: She laughs, then notices:
C: OLIVIA
D: Is that your son making-out with Hermia?
N: ACROSS THE FIELD, Marco and Sofia kiss by the fountain.
C: ANTONIO
D: I don’t want to stop it. But I don’t want to watch it either. Let’s get out of here.
E: standing
S: EXT. ALVARADO STREET - LATER
N: Antonio, pushing his bike, walks Olivia to her car -- even late at night, the street’s alive.
C: OLIVIA
D: Seventeen?
C: ANTONIO
D: My mom sent us to live with my Aunt - - you really want to hear this?
C: OLIVIA
D: Yes.
C: ANTONIO
D: Clara was only nine and I had to help out. So I started busing tables and working construction. Those guys you see outside Home Depot? That was me.
C: OLIVIA
D: I feel like I should’ve paid for the popsicles.
C: ANTONIO
D: When I finally got a steady job as a valet, I thought I was living the life. And I was able to help put Clara through college. She’s a school principal now.
E: proud
C: OLIVIA
D: She must be so grateful.
C: ANTONIO
D: If she is, she keeps it to herself.
N: They get to Olivia’s Range Rover.
C: ANTONIO
D: This is you, right?
E: CONT'D
N: Olivia beeps her car open, then:
C: OLIVIA
D: Actually, I don’t feel like being alone tonight. Is it okay if I stay at your place?
C: ANTONIO
D: Sure, but you get the chair this time.
N: He gets on his bike.
C: OLIVIA
D: That’s fair.
N: She hops on the back and they cruise down the hill.
C: ANTONIO
D: You know I’m gonna insist you take the bed.
C: OLIVIA
D: I was counting on it.
S: INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Cecilia holds a cigarette out the window. Hearing the key in the door, she puts it out, trying to usher the SMOKE outside. Antonio and Olivia enter.
C: ANTONIO
D: Mom, you promised--
C: CECILIA
D: I wasn’t smoking! But there’re some men over there spying on me. Did you hire thugs to catch me smoking?
C: ANTONIO
D: So you were smoking?
C: CECILIA
D: I allow myself one before bed. It relaxes me. Are you going to rob an old lady of a little pleasure?!
N: Cecilia heads to her bedroom:
C: CECILIA
D: Now I’m gonna need another.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: The detectives are watching us from that apartment.
N: He closes the curtains, then starts towards his room.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’ll close them in the bedroom too.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: No. If George wants to see what’s happening in the bedroom, let’s show him what’s happening in the bedroom.
C: ANTONIO
D: What’s happening in the bedroom?
C: OLIVIA
D: We’re gonna make him jealous. Relax. I’ve had a lot of fake sex in the movies. And not in the movies.
E: off his nervous look
S: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Perez and Stegman have set up SURVEILANCE EQUIPMENT -- along with lawn chairs, a cooler, and a hibachi -- across from Antonio’s apartment.
C: STEGMAN
D: I’m still confused -- who put the spell on Lysander?
C: PEREZ
D: Puck, but it doesn’t matter. I think what Shakespeare’s saying is we can’t help ourselves -- we fall in love with the wrong people. Oh, boy. Client ain’t gonna like this.
E: glances out the window
N: He grabs his camera and starts filming. STEGMAN’S POV -- Olivia and Antonio burst into the bedroom, “kissing” and tossing off clothing. Olivia, down to her bra and underwear, pushes Antonio, in boxers, onto the bed.
S: INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Antonio on his back, watches transfixed -- with fear and astonishment -- as Olivia climbs on top and “straddles” him.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m starting to feel uncomfortable.
C: OLIVIA
D: It’s okay, I don’t need you anymore -- you’re below the frame.
S: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: PEREZ and STEGMAN’S POV -- in the OPEN WINDOW across the way, all they see is Olivia from the waist up, having what appears to be hot, sweaty sex with Antonio (who can’t be seen).
S: INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: As Olivia continues to writhe in “ecstasy:”
C: ANTONIO
D: So I can leave?
C: OLIVIA
D: Just stay under the windowsill.
N: Antonio shimmies out from under her and rolls off the bed, making sure to keep his body very low. As he army-crawls towards door, Olivia ups the ante, and calls out “passionately” for the detectives’ benefit:
C: OLIVIA
D: Antonio! Antonio!
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: What?
C: OLIVIA
D: I’m acting. I’m so turned on right now!
E: whispering then, loudly
S: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Perez and Stegman watch Olivia bounce up and down.
C: OLIVIA
D: Grab my ass, big boy!

D: A lot.
S: INT. APARTMENT, ANOTHER UNIT - CONTINUOUS

E: CONT'D
N: He drops his joystick and crosses to the window for a better view.
S: INT. ANTONIO'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: With Olivia nearing “orgasm” in the other room, Antonio fixes himself a bowl of cereal.
C: OLIVIA
D: Oh God, Antonio! I’m coming! Antonio, yes! Yes! Yes!
E: O.S.
N: Cecilia walks in to get some water.
C: CECILIA
D: I’m not gonna ask.
S: INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - LATER
N: Olivia, now in Antonio’s pajamas, lies in bed. Antonio tries to get comfortable on the Barcalounger.
C: ANTONIO
D: I still don’t really get why’re you doing all this?
C: OLIVIA
D: A lot of reasons. None of them make much sense at the moment.
N: Olivia laughs to herself, but then... starts CRYING softly.
C: ANTONIO
D: You okay?
N: Antonio sits on the bed next to her.
C: OLIVIA
D: When I was a kid, I thought if I got famous, it would make everything better. And it did for a long time. It feels good when you think everyone loves you. But, really, they love this idea of you. I’ve got one of the most recognizable faces in the world, and I don’t feel like anyone really sees me. But I don’t want you to think I’m like a “poor little movie star.”
C: ANTONIO
D: I don’t think that.
C: OLIVIA
D: And you work all the time and everyone tells you what you want to hear. And you convince yourself you’ve got the perfect life everyone thinks you have. But I’ve never really had a decent, long-
C: term relationship. I spent
D: Thanksgiving at my assistant’s house. All my friends are people I pay. And if I’m honest, I doubt George’ll ever leave his wife.
C: ANTONIO
D: He’d be crazy not to.
C: OLIVIA
D: You’re a good guy.
N: She snuggles into him.
C: OLIVIA
D: Why can’t I fall for someone like you?
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m taken.
N: She smiles.
C: OLIVIA
D: That’s my type.
N: Antonio starts to get up, but--
C: OLIVIA
D: No, stay. Sleep next to me.
E: CONT'D
N: He slides under the covers.
C: OLIVIA
D: Want to hear something funny? Olivia Allan isn’t even my real name. It’s Betsy Shevchuk.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: It’s good you changed it.
N: She cuddles into him. Antonio’s EYES GO WIDE.
C: OLIVIA
D: This is nice.
C: ANTONIO
D: A little too nice. Let’s sleep back to back.
N: He rolls over.
S: EXT. PICO-UNION - THE NEXT MORNING
N: As the sun rises over the neighborhood, Perez bounds up the steps of the STAKEOUT APARTMENT BUILDING with a TO-GO BAG.
S: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Stegman reclines in a lawn chair. Perez bursts in.
C: PEREZ
D: I made us three hundred bucks. Tipped off the paparazzi. Questionable ethics, I know, but today we eat like kings.
S: INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
N: Olivia sleeps peacefully. Antonio, sleeps next to her, a safe distance away. He wakes when he gets a TEXT from Isabel: “U up? Need to see you.” He texts back: “How about now?” Excited, he quickly starts to put on his clothes.
C: OLIVIA
D: Where’re you going?
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m meeting Isabel. Go back to bed. Coffee’s above the fridge.
N: He grabs his shoes and rushes out.
S: EXT. PICO-UNION - LATER
N: Antonio, all smiles, pedals down Union, as shop owners open up for the day.

E: O.S.
S: INT. LOCAL BAKERY - LATER
N: Antonio and Isabel drink coffee.
C: ANTONIO
D: Me either. My mind was racing.
C: ISABEL
D: This is really hard for me, but I thought about it and thought about it... this is never going to be what I need.
C: ANTONIO
D: What’re you saying?
C: ISABEL
D: It’s been nine months. It’s time we got a divorce.
C: ANTONIO
D: You kissed me last night.
C: ISABEL
D: I can’t stop thinking about how you turned down all that money. Antonio, you go through life acting like you don’t deserve much. How do you think that makes me feel? I want to be with someone who thinks they deserve the best of everything.
C: ANTONIO
D: You said you loved me.
C: ISABEL
D: I did... I do... but we met when we were young. We’re different people now. I’m sorry.
C: ANTONIO
D: But--
C: ISABEL
D: My friend’s sister is a lawyer -- she said she’d do the paperwork.
N: He falls back in his chair, devastated.
C: ISABEL
D: The good thing about not having much is there’s not much to fight over.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. ROYCE TOWER, GEORGE’S OFFICE - LATER
N: George admires an intricate MODEL of the Pico-Union project with Daniel and the ARCHITECTS.
C: GEORGE
D: A work of art, people. Bravo.
N: Daniel’s phone BUZZES.
C: GEORGE
D: Is that Perez?
E: CONT'D
N: Daniel looks at the text -- it’s a video from Olivia and Antonio’s fake sex show.
C: DANIEL
D: More important matters at hand.
C: GEORGE
D: Don’t treat me like a child.
N: He GRABS THE PHONE and HITS PLAY and watches.
C: OLIVIA
D: Grab my ass, big boy!
E: O.S.
N: Daniel braces for an outburst, but George remains oddly calm:
C: GEORGE
D: Okay. I see. Good to know.
N: He hands the phone back, then turns back to the model:
C: GEORGE
D: I feel like this tree wants to be over here. Do you mind?
E: CONT'D
N: The architects look on nervously, as George gently moves the tiny, 3D Eucalyptus a quarter inch. He steps back:
C: GEORGE
D: No, a little further. Little further still. There. Perfect.
E: CONT'D adjusting it moving it again
N: But then -- he starts PUMMELLING the model with his fists.
C: GEORGE
D: That wily son of bitch!
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. PICO-UNION - LATER
N: A miserable Antonio bikes up to his apartment where several papparazzi wait out front. As they snap photos:
C: PAPPARAZZI #7
D: Antonio! How’s it going, buddy?
C: ANTONIO
D: Not in the mood, Tom.
N: He hops off his bike. As he hoists it on his shoulder, he sees Mr. Kim and a tenant carrying a heavy table upstairs. Frustrated, Antonio quickly locks his bike on the side of the building.
S: INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: CLOSE ON -- A MOVIE ON TV. Olivia and a handsome actor stroll along the beach, their DIALOGUE DUBBED. REVEAL Cecilia and Olivia watching on the couch, like it’s the most normal thing in the world.
C: OLIVIA
D: I think I’m more attractive in Spanish.
N: The door opens, and Antonio storms in.
C: OLIVIA
D: How did it go?
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: Not great.
N: He crosses into his room...
S: INT. ANTONIO’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: ...and changes into his valet uniform. Olivia follows.
C: OLIVIA
D: What happened?
C: ANTONIO
D: Isabel wants a divorce.
C: OLIVIA
D: What? Why?
C: ANTONIO
D: She was only interested because I was with you. When she found out I wasn’t, it was adios Antonio.
C: OLIVIA
D: I’m really sorry.
C: ANTONIO
D: Yeah. Me too.
N: Antonio, followed by Olivia, crosses out.
S: INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: He opens the fridge and throws together a lunch.
C: OLIVIA
D: Did she give you any other reason?
C: ANTONIO
D: She doesn’t want to be with a valet. She has bigger plans than me.
C: OLIVIA
D: She said that?
C: ANTONIO
D: She’s been saying that one way or the other for years.
C: OLIVIA
D: Then maybe she doesn’t deserve you.
N: He loads up his lunchbox, including a few condiment packets from Arby’s:
C: ANTONIO
D: I take mustard from restaurants so I don’t have to pay for a whole jar. Yeah, I’m a real catch.
C: OLIVIA
D: I have a drawer full of soy sauce packets.
C: ANTONIO
D: I don’t want to talk about it.
C: CECILIA
D: Antonio, if you mess this up, I’m choosing her.
C: ANTONIO
D: Stay out of this, Mom!
C: OLIVIA
D: Why don’t you want to talk about it?
C: ANTONIO
D: ‘Cause I don’t, okay?
C: OLIVIA
D: You’re a wonderful guy. You should be with someone who sees that.
C: ANTONIO
D: How can you say that with a straight face?
C: OLIVIA
D: What does that mean?
C: ANTONIO
D: Nothing.
C: OLIVIA
D: No, I want to know.
C: ANTONIO
D: You can have any man in the world and you pick one that’s married?
C: OLIVIA
D: That’s not fair. I didn’t know he was married when we met.
C: ANTONIO
D: You ever think maybe you don’t want a relationship? That maybe you like being alone. Maybe you don’t want anyone to really know you.
C: OLIVIA
D: That’s ridiculous.
C: ANTONIO
D: You don’t even talk to your own mother. I share a bathroom with mine. And she’s not shy!
C: OLIVIA
D: How did this become about me? This is about you.
C: ANTONIO
D: You don’t know anything about me.
N: He storms outside...
S: EXT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Antonio heads downstairs, Olivia close on his heels.
C: OLIVIA
D: What’re you talking about? I’m your friend.
C: ANTONIO
D: Really? We’re friends?
C: OLIVIA
D: Of course.
C: ANTONIO
D: Come on -- you’re gonna go back to your movie star life and I’m gonna go back to being invisible to you.
C: OLIVIA
D: That’s not true.
C: ANTONIO
D: So you’re gonna call me and we’re gonna go out for lunch?
C: OLIVIA
D: I don’t know. Maybe. I don’t really do that with anyone.
C: ANTONIO
D: Yeah, that’s what I thought.
N: When they reach the sidewalk, the paparazzi snap pictures.
C: ANTONIO
D: Oh, look -- your real friends.
E: CONT'D
N: Antonio yells to the paparazzi:
C: ANTONIO
D: Get them while you can, guys. We’re breaking up. It’s over.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: Antonio...
C: ANTONIO
D: What?
E: angry
C: OLIVIA
D: Forget it.
N: Disappointed, she heads down the street to her car. The paparazzi have a choice -- Olivia or Antonio? Without hesitation, they follow Olivia... ...leaving Antonio ALONE on the sidewalk. He watches them disappear down the block, then turns to get his bike -- only to discover it’s been STOLEN. All that remains is the FRONT WHEEL locked to the fence.
C: ANTONIO
D: Perfect.
N: A Jaguar SCREECHES to the curb. George stumbles out of the back, disheveled and drunk, and marches over to Antonio.
C: GEORGE
D: I didn’t hire you to screw my girlfriend, you greasy tomcat!
N: George PUNCHES him. As Antonio stumbles into the fence, George grimaces in pain, grabbing his hand.
C: GEORGE
D: Wow. That really hurt. Way more than I expected.
E: CONT'D
N: In the back of the car, Daniel watches his boss with disdain.
C: GEORGE
D: I’m not paying you a cent!
E: CONT'D
N: George climbs in and they drive off.
S: EXT. BUS STOP - LATER
N: Forlorn, Antonio sits on the bench, with a SWOLLEN EYE, holding the bike wheel. He looks over to see an ad for Randy the Realtor, firing his trademark finger guns. Antonio fires back with both middle fingers.
S: INT. BUS - MOMENTS LATER
N: Antonio walks down the aisle, searching for a seat among the other “invisibles.”
S: EXT. PICO BOULEVARD - CONTINUOUS

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. KOBRA, VALET STAND - LATER
N: Antonio brings Javier and Benny up to speed.
C: JAVIER
D: It was all fake?
C: ANTONIO
D: The whole thing.
C: BENNY
D: You never had sex with her?
C: ANTONIO
D: No.
C: BENNY
D: Not even a...
N: He makes a “handjob” motion and whistles.
C: ANTONIO
D: Nope.
C: BENNY
D: Don’t wanna delight in your misery, but the world makes sense again.
C: JAVIER
D: Guey, you got to lay low. That billionaire’s gonna use his billionaire connections and get your brown ass deported back to Mexico.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m a U.S. citizen! I vote. I have a passport.
C: JAVIER
D: Whatever. When you have to sneak back in, go through Texas. California and Arizona are way too hot right now.
N: A MERCEDES pulls to the curb. Daniel lowers the window:
C: DANIEL
D: Mr. Flores -- you have a minute?
N: Javier looks at Daniel. Then at Antonio. Then back at Daniel. Then... Javier SPRINTS away.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT / INT. MERCEDES - LATER
N: Parked in a quiet corner, Daniel talks to Antonio.
C: DANIEL
D: My employer can be volatile, but you kept your side of the bargain.
N: He hands a CHECK to Antonio who unfolds it.
C: ANTONIO
D: Twenty-five thousand dollars? That’s way more than we agreed to.
C: DANIEL
D: He won’t notice.
C: ANTONIO
D: I can’t accept this.
C: DANIEL
D: I grew up not too far from you. My dad was the locker room attendant at the California Club. I know what this money can mean to you.
C: ANTONIO
D: I don’t feel like I deserve-- Actually, I will take it. Thank you.
E: then, catching himself
C: DANIEL
D: Thank you. In my job, I don’t get many opportunities to do the right thing.
S: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - LATER
N: As Perez packs up his gear, Stegman looks out the window:
C: STEGMAN
D: Look at these two. They just had sex. Now he’s making her eggs.
N: ACROSS THE WAY, Cecilia laughs as he flips the omlette with a flourish.
C: STEGMAN
D: Swear to God -- never had a relationship that good.
E: CONT'D
C: PEREZ
D: Listen, I got this two bedroom in the Marina. Has a view of the Jetty. Get you off your SpongeBob trundle.
C: STEGMAN
D: Is that an offer?
C: PEREZ
D: It’d be nice to have some company. And there’s a paddle tennis court.
C: STEGMAN
D: Maybe we can get back in shape. Keep each other accountable.
N: As they seal the deal with a bro-hug, Stegman notices:
C: STEGMAN
D: Oh, shit. Call 911.
E: CONT'D
N: ACROSS THE WAY, Cecilia, clutching her chest, stumbles to the ground.
S: INT. CHURCH OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION - DAY

S: EXT. BRENTWOOD MANSION - SAME TIME
N: Kathryn sits on the VERANDA, looking at international real estate listings. She calls into the master bedroom:
C: KATHRYN
D: George. You need to see this cute little apartment. It has a view of the Eiffel Tower.
N: She reaches into a bowl of cherries and pops one into her mouth. Instantly, she grimaces, clutching her jaw.
C: KATHRYN
D: Ow.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. BRENTWOOD MANSION, DINNING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
N: Kathryn waits at the table as George saunters in.
C: GEORGE
D: Have you seen my phone?
N: She holds it up.
C: KATHRYN
D: I called the “dentist.” Don’t worry, I hung up when I got her voicemail.
N: George turns ashen, then:
C: GEORGE
D: Okay, it happened one time. Last May, on the Lawrence’s yacht. You were in Aspen at the Ideas Festival. We were fighting, it was my birthday, I was feeling old, I overdid the daiquiris, and she flattered me with her attention.
S: INT. BRENTWOOD MANSION, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Blanca hides in the doorway, holding the MINI-RECORDER, taping the conversation.
C: GEORGE
D: I swear, she means nothing to me -- she’s just a vain, insecure actress I wish I never met.
E: O.S.
S: INT. CHURCH OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION - DAY
N: In the first three rows, Antonio’s family sits on one side, including Isabel; on the other, Mr. Kim’s family. There are also many people from the neighborhood. The PRIEST finishes his prayer and nods to -- Antonio, sitting in the front row next to Clara, who gives him a tearful hug. Antonio makes his way to the pulpit. He looks out at the crowd. Takes a deep breath.
C: ANTONIO
D: I, um... I’m going to speak in English because I want Mr. Kim to understand everything.
N: Mr. Kim’s granddaughter TRANSLATES, whispering in his ear. Mr. Kim looks up. He didn’t expect this.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’d be nervous in Spanish. I’m really nervous in English.
E: CONT'D
N: Antonio pulls out his notes.
C: ANTONIO
D: Cecilia Imelda Lopez Flores was born in Zacapala, Puebla -- a village so small, it didn’t appear on any maps.
E: CONT'D
N: IN THE PEWS, Clara lovingly puts her head on Benny’s shoulder. Next to her, Dante and Luca watch funny videos on their iPad, hidden in a prayer book.
C: ANTONIO
D: She had a tough childhood -- her father liked tequila and it got ugly sometimes -- so she ran away.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: ANTONIO
D: She worked in the fields and when she made enough money she sent for her mother and sisters. She always said, “Change is good, though you don’t always know why when it happens.” That’s when she met my dad, who owned one of the fields. They had two kids by the time she was nineteen. And then my dad tried to break up a fight between some workers and died from a knife wound. She brought the whole family to Mexico City, trying to climb back up... and she sort of did. She got a job in a skyscraper as a cleaning lady. She could see the whole city from up there. “People go to college to have an office with this view,” she said, “I get twenty views like this every day.” I guess we were alike that way. I get paid to drive fancy cars.
E: CONT'D off the cuff
N: People laugh, including Isabel, who smiles warmly.
C: ANTONIO
D: Mama saved every penny she could to send Clara and me to the States.
E: CONT'D
N: Antonio stops, starting to choke up.
C: ANTONIO
D: She wanted a better life for us.
E: CONT'D
N: This is getting really hard for him.
C: ANTONIO
D: I found out later she never ate lunch at work to save that money.
E: CONT'D
N: He wipes tears from his face. Takes a deep breath and gathers the strength to continue.
C: ANTONIO
D: She said she would follow us soon, but she was never going to leave her mother and Abuelita lived till ninety-one. Only then were we able to bring Mama to live with us. And that’s how she met Mr. Kim. He pretended to like her pozole. I can say this now, my mother was not a great cook.
E: CONT'D
N: Benny laughs. Antonio turns to Mr. Kim.
C: ANTONIO
D: Ha-Joon, I don’t know if she told you, but she only had two romances in her life. My dad -- and you. Thank you for bringing her so much happiness.
E: CONT'D
N: Mr. Kim nods his appreciation, fighting back tears.
C: ANTONIO
D: My mother didn’t live the kind of life that was going to get her picture in a magazine...
E: CONT'D
N: He looks around the church. At Clara. At Isabel. At Marco, who taps his heart -- “I’m so proud of you, Dad.” Antonio smiles -- maybe he’s talking about himself a little too.
C: ANTONIO
D: ...but she lived an extraordinary life. When she loved...
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. CEMETARY - DAY
N: Standing by the grave, family members take turns tossing handfuls of dirt onto Cecilia’s casket.
C: ANTONIO
D: ...she loved fully. When she hugged, she squeezed the life out of you. When she laughed, the ground shook.
E: O.S.
N: Antonio lets the earth fall through his fingers.
C: ANTONIO
D: Goodbye, Mama. Te amo. Que descanses en paz.
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: Finally, Mr. Kim drops a single red rose. He turns to leave, then, overcome with grief, tries to CLIMB INTO THE HOLE. Benny and Antonio restrain him.
S: INT. ANTONIO'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: At the RECEPTION, family and friends mingle. Antonio passes by Clara:
C: CLARA
D: People brought too much food.
C: ANTONIO
D: Way too much. The Koreans are even worse than the Mexicans.
N: Antonio sees Isabel by the buffet and walks over.
C: ANTONIO
D: I’m glad you came.
E: CONT'D
C: ISABEL
D: I felt closer to your mom than my own.
C: ANTONIO
D: I think she liked that.
C: ISABEL
D: Can we talk outside?
S: EXT. ANTONIO'S APARTMENT, BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Antonio stands with Isabel.
C: ISABEL
D: I know I’ve been all over the map and I feel really bad about the way I handled... everything.
C: ANTONIO
D: There’s no easy way to end a marriage.
C: ISABEL
D: That’s the thing... I don’t think I want to.
C: ANTONIO
D: What’re you saying?
C: ISABEL
D: You’re a good man. I started taking that for granted.
C: ANTONIO
D: You want to stay married?
C: ISABEL
D: Yes.
N: Antonio’s speechless as he takes in this information.
C: ISABEL
D: That’s what you want, right?
E: CONT'D
N: Beat, then:
C: ANTONIO
D: I don’t think... I do anymore.
C: ISABEL
D: Whoa, okay...
C: ANTONIO
D: Isabel, I’ll always love you. But we don’t belong together.
C: ISABEL
D: I thought--
C: ANTONIO
D: I did. I guess what I realized -- you don’t see me in the way I want to be seen.
N: She nods, taking this in. This strikes a cord with her.
C: ISABEL
D: Antonio, I--
C: ANTONIO
D: It’s okay. You were right. It’s time to move on. Life’s short. Maybe it’s not too late for us to find our own Mr. Kims.
E: re: funeral reception
N: Isabel smiles. Antonio pulls a CHECK out of his pocket and hands it to her.
C: ANTONIO
D: Here. So you can finish school.
E: CONT'D
C: ISABEL
D: $12,850? You still want me to have this?
C: ANTONIO
D: They actually gave me a little more. I’m gonna go in with Benny on a valet stand. I’m gonna be a boss.
C: ISABEL
D: Good for you. Well... I guess I should go.
E: then
C: ANTONIO
D: Goodbye, Isabel.
C: ISABEL
D: Goodbye, Antonio.
N: She kisses him on the cheek, then walks off. He watches, half hoping she’ll turn around and fight for him. But she doesn’t. After a moment, he heads back in...
S: INT. ANTONIO'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: ...lingering near the door, not ready to join the party. But then there’s a KNOCK. Antonio lights up -- maybe it’s Isabel after all. He opens the door... But it’s BLANCA, holding the mini-recorder.
C: BLANCA
D: I think you need to hear this.
S: EXT. KOBRA, VALET STAND - DAY
N: Antonio, with the MINI-RECORDER, talks to his co-workers:
C: ANTONIO
D: I feel like I should get this to her, but I don’t know where she lives. I don’t have her number. And she probably hates me anyway.
C: BENNY
D: You said shitty things. I mean, she’s famous, but the woman has feelings.
C: JAVIER
D: You know my opinion. Walk away. These people will eat you alive.
C: BENNY
D: Wait, I know how to get it to her. She just started filming some new movie at Paramount. She told me while we were dancing. That’s right, you assholes. We were dancing.
E: to Javier and Rudy
N: Benny shows off his best moves.
C: RUDY
D: It’s impossible to get on one of those lots. My uncle’s a gardener at Sony. He has to show them like five IDs just to mow the lawn.
N: A FERRARI pulls up. A GAY COUPLE steps out, the driver tossing his blazer into the back seat.
C: ANTONIO
D: I know how to get on.
S: EXT. PARAMOUNT PICTURES, MAIN GATE - LATER
N: The Ferrari pulls up to the kiosk. Antonio in the driver’s seat, now wearing the blazer, rolls down his window:
C: ANTONIO
D: Forgot my pass, bro.
N: The GUARD opens the gate and waves him through.
S: EXT. PARAMOUNT PICTURES, PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Antonio drives by the VALET STAND...
C: ANTONIO
D: It’s okay -- I’ll park it myself.
N: ...and expertly backs the car into a tight spot. The Valets watch, impressed. As Antonio hops out, his phone buzzes. He checks the text -- “On salads. U got an hour.”
S: INT./EXT. PARAMOUNT PICTURES, ROADSIDE DINER - DAY
N: As the crew sets up for the next scene, Olivia, dressed as a waitress, sits in a booth, going over lines. She glances out the window to see -- Antonio, across the street. He waves sheepishly. Olivia, feeling a lot of different emotions, holds up a finger, indicating she’ll be right out. As if on cue, the crew picks up the DINER FACADE and carries it off -- leaving a clear path. Olivia walks over.
C: ANTONIO
D: Can we talk?
C: OLIVIA
D: I’d like that.
S: INT. OLIVIA’S ON-SET TRAILER - LATER
N: Antonio hands Olivia the MINI-RECORDER.
C: ANTONIO
D: You’re not gonna want to listen this, but...
C: OLIVIA
D: Let me guess. He’s saying things that are gonna hurt my feelings?
C: ANTONIO
D: Pretty much.
C: OLIVIA
D: I don’t need to hear it -- I’ve decided... I’m gonna end it with George.
C: ANTONIO
D: Really?
C: OLIVIA
D: It took me way too long, but I think I’m finally ready. You probably deserve a little credit for that.
C: ANTONIO
D: Look at us. After everything -- neither of us are gonna end up with the people we thought we wanted.
C: OLIVIA
D: Crazy, right?
S: EXT. KOBRA - LATER
N: Rudy runs out of the restaurant to Benny.
C: RUDY
D: Guey, we got a problem.
S: EXT. PARAMOUNT PICTURES, BACK LOT - LATER
N: Olivia walks Antonio out of her trailer.
C: ANTONIO
D: Yeah, my sister keeps trying to set me up, but I’m gonna lay low for a while.
C: OLIVIA
D: Don’t wait too long. That night ditching the detectives was one of the funnest I’ve had in years. You got skills.
C: ANTONIO
D: Really?
E: flattered
C: OLIVIA
D: Don’t let ‘em go to waste.
N: Olivia’s phone RINGS. She looks at it.
C: OLIVIA
D: George. He keeps calling. Think he knows something’s up.
E: CONT'D
N: She hits DECLINE.
C: OLIVIA
D: I want to be in the right frame of mind when I tell him. I’ve tried breaking up with him before but he always sweet talks me out of it.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: If you get weak, give me a call... ...I’ll press play on this thing.
E: re: recorder
C: OLIVIA I will.
D: Does this mean we’re friends?
E: then
C: ANTONIO
D: I guess it does.
N: They smile at each other with genuine affection. But then -- Antonio’s phone buzzes. He checks the text.
C: ANTONIO
D: Oh, no. They’re not ordering dessert.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. KOBRA - LATER
N: The Gay Couple walks out of the restaurant. AT THE VALET STAND, Benny turns to Javier:
C: BENNY
D: Oh, crap.
N: The DRIVER hands his ticket to Benny.
C: BENNY
D: Okay. Alrighty. I’ll just let my guys know you want your vehicle right away and we’ll get that to you lickity-split. Gotcha covered... No waiting...
E: CONT'D pretending to text
N: Just then -- the Ferrari drives up.
C: BENNY
D: And, oh my God -- here you are.
E: CONT'D
N: Antonio hops out and hold the doors open.
C: DRIVER
D: That was fast.
C: ANTONIO
D: Kept it close for you, sir.
C: BENNY
D: Not asking, but wouldn’t mind a nice shout-out on Yelp. Courteous, timely, not too much cologne -- those are just my words.
S: EXT. ANTONIO'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
N: The full moon lights the palm trees.
S: INT. ANTONIO’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: PAN ACROSS the empty room to find Antonio sitting on his couch next to Mr. Kim. They watch an action movie together -- something they both can understand. They miss Cecilia, but it feels good to have company. Antonio reaches into his pocket:

D: Hi, George.
S: EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - MOMENTS LATER

C: GEORGE
D: That hoodie gets me every time.

E: O.S.
C: GEORGE
D: What? What’re you talking about?
E: O.S.
C: PEREZ
D: Sound quality’s pretty good, right? Bought it used for under a grand.

S: INT. ROYCE TOWER, PENTHOUSE - INTERCUT

N: George looks out the window to the street. Kathryn waves from the backseat of Perez’s car.
C: GEORGE
D: It’s not what you think. I asked Olivia here to tell her to leave me alone once and for all.
C: KATHRYN
D: Oh, please -- you’re ridiculous. And turn around, you’re about to be served divorce papers.
N: Olivia opens the door. Antonio steps in, handing George legal documents.
C: ANTONIO
D: It’s okay, you don’t have to tip me.
C: KATHRYN
D: I’m also taking the company.
C: GEORGE
D: You can’t do that. I built this empire from the ground up.
C: KATHRYN
D: My father built it. You just slapped your name on everything. Oh, and you might want to call your lawyer. I did some digging and found some of your clever off-shore holdings. As a member of the board, I have a duty to inform the authorities.
C: GEORGE
D: Olivia, I’m finally free of that witch. We can get married.
N: Olivia’s so appalled, she doesn’t know what to say, until:
C: OLIVIA
D: Vete a freir pinas.
N: Antonio smiles proudly.
C: GEORGE
D: You’re speaking Spanish now?! He brainwashed you!
C: ANTONIO
D: Adios, George.
N: Antonio and Olivia leave.
S: EXT. STREET - LATER
N: Kathryn, Antonio and Olivia stand by Perez’s car.
C: OLIVIA
D: I’m so sorry I got involved with him. I don’t know what to say.
C: KATHRYN
D: When I met George he was married to his first wife -- so I knew what I was getting.
N: Olivia smiles.
C: KATHRYN
D: You know this divorce is going to get messy. It might be hard to keep your name out of the papers.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIA
D: It’s okay. It’s the truth. I’m done pretending to be someone I’m not.
C: KATHRYN
D: We’re all just doing the best we can, right?
C: OLIVIA
D: It’s exhausting.
C: KATHRYN
D: Yes, it is.
N: Perez steps over.
C: PEREZ
D: Don’t mean to interrupt, but who should we invoice for this?
C: ANTONIO
D: Not me. One of these two.
C: KATHRYN
D: I’ve got it. Mr. Flores, you didn’t ask for any of this. Is there anything I can do to show my gratitude?
E: turning to Antonio
C: ANTONIO
D: Um, well...

E: CONT'D
C: COUCILMAN GARCIA
D: It’s come to my attention the developers have changed their mind.

S: EXT. BAKERFIELD, CA - DAY
N: A working class neighborhood. Olivia drives up to a small tract house in the middle of the block. She parks and makes the long walk to the front door. Olivia KNOCKS and takes a couple deep breathes as she waits. A TOUGH BROAD in her 70s finally opens the door. Olivia speaks to her in Ukrainian.
C: OLIVIA
D: Hi, Mama. It’s nice to see you.
S: INT. CITY BIKES - DAY
N: Antonio walks in carrying all that remains of his stolen bike -- the FRONT TIRE -- and approaches Natalie at the counter.
C: ANTONIO
D: I need a bike to go with this wheel.
C: NATALIE
D: Something like that?
N: She points to the rest of his bike leaning against the wall.
C: NATALIE
D: Bought it off a junkie in the park. Figured you’d be in eventually.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: That’s amazing. How much do I owe you?
C: NATALIE
D: Eight bucks. He was an awful negotiator.
N: Antonio laughs.
C: NATALIE
D: Did you hear? We get to stay. Everyone does.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: Yeah, I was really happy about that.
C: NATALIE
D: No one has any idea why they changed their minds.
C: ANTONIO
D: Sometimes the good guys just win.
C: NATALIE
D: Well, give me a few hours -- I’ll have this up and running.

C: ANTONIO

N: Antonio heads out...
S: EXT. CITY BIKES - CONTINUOUS

S: INT. LANGER’S DELI, MACARTHUR PARK - DAY
N: Antonio and Olivia eat sandwiches in a booth.
C: OLIVIA
D: And?
C: ANTONIO
D: I think her exact words were, “What took you so long?”
N: Olivia howls with excitement.
C: OLIVIA
D: So did you go out? How was it?
C: ANTONIO
D: A little weird -- I haven’t been on a date in forever, but she’s taking me to some band she likes Saturday, so I think it went okay.
C: OLIVIA
D: Did you kiss her?
C: ANTONIO
D: A man never tells. What’s going on with you?
C: OLIVIA
D: You totally kissed her.
C: ANTONIO
D: Think what you want, I’m not saying anything. You talk.
C: OLIVIA
D: Okay, well... actually I have big news. I went home last week.
C: ANTONIO
D: You saw your mom?
C: OLIVIA
D: Yeah, it’s not like we repaired everything, but it’s a start. And it turns out I have a half-brother who has a two year-old daughter. She followed me around everywhere and called me Aunt Wivia so I think I’m gonna spend Christmas there and spoil the crap out of her.
N: She grabs a pickle off his plate.
C: ANTONIO
D: What’re you doing?
C: OLIVIA
D: Eating a pickle.
C: ANTONIO
D: Get your own pickle.
C: OLIVIA
D: I thought you were done.
C: ANTONIO
D: I was saving it. If you want more pickles, order more pickles.
C: OLIVIA
D: I don’t need a whole thing of pickles.
N: PULL BACK thru the window, to outside on the busy street...
C: OLIVIA
D: I just want a bite of pickle.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTONIO
D: Fine. I’ll cut you a small piece. But that’s all you’re getting.
N: ...looking in at two friends...
C: OLIVIA
D: I’ll order some pickles.
C: ANTONIO
D: Just take my pickle. I don’t even want it anymore.
N: ...eating lunch together.
T: FADE OUT.
