M: What would we do without our
M: girlfriends?
S: 1 EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT 1
N: The BLACKNESS shimmers and moves. We realize it's a DARK SEA.
C: VIVI
D: Of course, we sometimes disagree.
E: V.O.
N: WE GO UNDER the waves. The WATER undulates. A CHURNING ocean.
C: VIVI
D: We envy each other, we hide things from each other.
E: V.O.
N: A DEAD BODY crashes through the water. Slowly sinking.
C: VIVI
D: But when it comes down to it, we'll do anything for each other...
E: V.O.
N: A GLINT of something in the dark. REVEAL, tangled in the body's sweater: a gold BRACELET. CLOSE ON the bracelet, inscribed with: “Choose Happiness.” The BODY SINKS below camera, leaving a TRAIL of BLOOD.
C: VIVI
D: Anything.
E: V.O.
N: SMASH TO TITLES: “TIES THAT BIND” SNAPPY POP MUSIC COMES UP as we FADE UP ON A LIGHTER WORLD:
S: 2 EXT. LINDSAY'S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - DAY (D1) 2
N: A wide blue SKY, a long green LAWN, a gorgeous HOUSE and BARN. A white van out front, on the side: “Lindsay Leighton Interiors and Landscape Design.” FLY INSIDE -- TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 2.
S: 3 INT. LINDSAY'S BARN - DAY (D1) 3
N: It's dressed for a chic party: cocktail tables, flowers, hanging lanterns. LINDSAY CRAWFORD LEIGHTON, white, early 40's, primps the party as she talks on her cell --
C: LINDSAY
D: No, it has to be a Juliet rose. Because. People hire me for perfect. That's my brand.
N: As she hangs up, we don't doubt it. She’s used to being in control and it shows: her dress, her hair, the décor: all flawless. Except... that crooked lantern up in the rafters. Damn. OFF Lindsay, eyeing a ladder--
C: VIVI
D: Are you crazy?
E: PRELAP
S: 4 INT. VIVI AND RORY'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAY (D1) 4
N: An idyllic cottage, perfect for a young couple in love. VIVIAN VASQUEZ, AKA “VIVI,” our survivor, 30's, Latina, cute pixie haircut, does her makeup at her vanity. Her boyfriend, RORY CRAWFORD, 30's, white, dashing and preppy, sits behind her, kissing her neck. Vivi smiles, brushing him away.
C: VIVI
D: We can’t be late for dinner. Your sister will kill us.
N: Rory ignores her, tries to slip her bra strap from her shoulder...but she INSTANTLY CLAMPS her hand down on his. NO. STOP. They eye each other in the mirror. Rory knows what this is about. He’s tender with her.
C: RORY
D: Babe, I know your body’s changed. And I still think you’re the sexiest woman in the entire world.
N: She looks at him, grateful. His words help. She turns to kiss him. He kisses back. As thing get heated, we PULL OUT from their window, landing in --
S: 5 EXT. NYC - STREET / OFFICE BUILDING - DAY (D1) 5
N: -- the bustling world of NYC, where we COME DOWN on our firecracker, ANA NZINGA HUGHES, 30's, African American/mixed race, bold and chic, bursting out of an office building, striding toward a waiting town car -- (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 3. 5 CONTINUED: 5
C: ANA
D: Woke, my ass!
N: Close behind her is JAMIE LIM, 30's, Asian, business suit, friendly frat boy vibe.
C: JAMIE
D: Dude, chill. What exactly did they say?
C: ANA
D: I didn’t get the promotion. But they would love to have me serve on the diversity council.
C: JAMIE
D: What? Why didn’t you get it?
C: ANA
D: Didn’t put in enough face time at the office, my trades were too risky... Please. If you want to accomplish anything in this world, you have to take risks!
N: Taking us BACK TO--
S: 6 INT. LINDSAY'S BARN - DAY (D1) 6
N: Risky Lindsay, on the ladder, fixing the lantern. Suddenly the rope holding it slips and the lantern FALLS. She screams-- but, a foot from her head, it STOPS. She looks down to find her savior: ridiculously hot NICK WOLFSON, 30's, sexy stubble, holding the rope -- and looking right up her skirt.
C: LINDSAY
D: Nick? Oh my god. Thank you. What are you doing here?
E: then
C: NICK
D: Just dropped by to save your life.
N: She stares down at him as he looks up at her. Damn, he is cute -- and charming. They clearly have a vibe.
C: NICK
D: And to pick up the blueprints for the Jackson project. Putting the doors in tomorrow.
E: CONT’D
N: (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 4. 6 CONTINUED: 6 Nick starts climbing the ladder. Lindsay reacts, she’s used to calling the shots --
C: LINDSAY
D: What is happening right now?
N: But now he’s right behind her, hoisting the lantern --
C: NICK
D: I got this, gorgeous.
N: As he leans in close to her, she can feel him pressing into her ass. CLOSE ON a scandalized Lindsay, this is highly inappropriate. At the same time, this may be the sexiest thing that’s ever happened to her. Especially when Nick puts his hand on Lindsay’s hip and murmurs into her ear--
C: NICK
D: So, why the sexy dress ten feet in the air? Not complaining. I enjoyed the view.
E: CONT’D
N: Lindsay can barely speak --
C: LINDSAY
D: I’m... hosting a surprise party for one of my best friends in an hour. You’re... welcome to drop by for a glass of wine, of course.
E: always polite
C: NICK
D: What are you doing after?
C: LINDSAY
D: Um, not sure.
E: breathless
N: He whispers in her ear, his body pressed against hers --
C: NICK
D: Come on, meet me tonight. After your thing.
N: She would like nothing more... but the reality is --
C: LINDSAY
D: Nick, I’m married. I can’t.
C: NICK
D: Too bad. Because there is a lot I would love to do to you.
N: (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 5. 6 CONTINUED: (2) 6 Lindsay’s mouth drops open as Nick climbs down. Off Lindsay, fanning herself, GO TO--
S: 7 INT. VIVI AND RORY'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAY (D1) 7
N: Two people who've just finished going at it: Vivi and Rory. She brings the sheet up high to cover her chest.
C: RORY
D: That was hot.
N: He looks at her sexily. But she’s insecure about her body--
C: VIVI
D: Was it?
C: RORY
D: Yes. Unless it wasn’t good for you? It... seemed like it was.
C: VIVI
D: No, it was. Sometimes, you know, the lack of estrogen is an issue, but this time, it was fine.
N: Not the most enthusiastic review.
C: RORY
D: Okay... Good.
N: He’s relieved. But also, unsure. We can see how much he wants to be there for her, to make sure she’s feeling okay about everything -- but underneath that? It’s emotionally exhausting. She clocks it.
C: VIVI
D: Something wrong, babe?
C: RORY
D: No. I’m just...excited for the day when this is all in the rear view mirror.
N: Cancer has been hard on him, too. She knows that.
C: VIVI
D: Me too.
N: They look at each other -- they’ve been through a lot and their look is full of love -- and kiss. Her phone rings, she looks at the caller I.D. (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 6. 7 CONTINUED: 7
C: VIVI
D: Speaking of. It’s Dr. Beth.
E: CONT’D
N: She gets up to take the call in another room as he waits--
S: 8 INT. VIVI AND RORY'S COTTAGE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (D1) 8
N: Vivi’s on the phone with Dr. Beth, whom we don’t see.
C: VIVI
D: Not gonna lie, Dr. Beth. I have a little scanxiety. You said you flagged something last time? How does it look?
E: INTO PHONE
N: She smiles nervously. But as she listens, her smile fades.
C: VIVI
D: No. No, that can’t be right. That’s not-- How does that even--?
E: CONT’D
N: Vivi throws the phone on the couch. We hear from the phone: DR. BETH (V.O. THRU PHONE) Vivi? Are you there? But Vivi just looks at the phone like it’s a snake.
S: 9 INT. VIVI AND RORY'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAY (D1) 9
N: Rory’s clearly been waiting for the news as Vivi enters.
C: RORY
D: What did she say?
N: Vivi wavers -- then decides. Answers brightly, covering --
C: VIVI
D: All good.
C: RORY
D: I knew it! Babe, that is the best news. We are gonna celebrate tonight! I’m gonna go shower.
E: hugs her, then
N: He goes and we’re off Vivi, alone, TORTURED --
S: 10 INT. TOWN CAR - DAY (D1) 10
N: Ana and Jamie sit in the back of a moving town car. (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 7. 10 CONTINUED: 10
C: ANA
D: Do you ever wonder why we even try? They don’t want us there except to fill some diversity quota.
C: JAMIE
D: Honestly? For me the bank is just an extension of my frat house.
C: ANA
D: Of course it is.
N: She shakes her head, feeling disillusioned. Jamie puts the divider up between them and the driver.
C: JAMIE
D: Hey, you know what’s great for stress relief? Physical activity.
N: Puts his hand on her knee, wink wink. She removes it:
C: ANA
D: Know what else is? Murder. I keep telling you, Lim. Not happening.
E: then
N: He gives in, sits back, grabs his vape pen.
C: JAMIE
D: Come on, loosen up, it’s Friday. You’ll get promoted next cycle.
C: ANA
D: I need the pay raise now.
N: Jamie eyes her --
C: JAMIE
D: Look -- if you like risk, I know a way you can make some cash, quick.
N: He WHISPERS in her ear. Ana pulls back--
C: ANA
D: Are you crazy? Yeah, I like risk. I don’t like prison.
N: She puts the divider down, calls out to the driver-- (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 8. 10 CONTINUED: (2) 10

N: PRELAP the sound of CHAMPAGNE POPPING and TIME CUT TO:
S: 11 EXT. LINDSAY'S YARD / BARN - EVENING (N1) 11
N: Lindsay carries champagne and 3 glasses, striding toward the barn, where we see Party Guests heading inside. Ana catches up to her as they WALK AND TALK --
C: ANA
D: Hey! V’s not here yet?
C: LINDSAY
D: Told her to come at 7.
C: ANA
D: She’s going to be so surprised. I can’t wait to see her face.
C: LINDSAY
D: I know, me too! Okay, I’m dying to know: did you get the promotion? What? Those fools. Oh, Ana, I’m so sorry. My dad knows Tim Jeffries at the bank if you want him to put in a call.
E: off her look, no
C: ANA
D: I don’t think that would help, but thanks. They said I was out of the office too much--
C: LINDSAY
D: But that was because--
C: ANA
D: They don’t want excuses. Look, the real problem with me not getting the promotion is... Now I’m not gonna have the investment money for Vivi’s restaurant.
C: LINDSAY
D: What?! Oh my god. You promised. V was counting on it. She’s gonna be devastated.
N: (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 9. 11 CONTINUED: 11
C: ANA
D: Wow, I feel so much better now, thanks.
C: LINDSAY
D: Sorry.
C: ANA
D: I hate to ask, but can you do it?
C: LINDSAY
D: $200K? No. I have zero cash flow. Why don’t we ask my parents?
C: ANA
D: Please. They would never. They hate that their golden son is dating the help’s daughter.
C: LINDSAY
D: I don’t think that’s it. I admit they aren’t Vivi’s biggest fans, but I don’t know why.
N: They LAND at a PATIO near the barn, just as Vivi approaches.
S: 12 EXT. PATIO OUTSIDE LINDSAY’S BARN - DAY (D1) 12
C: LINDSAY
D: I mean, look at her, who could not love Vivi??
N: Vivi arrives, in a pretty dress, hair and makeup done.
C: LINDSAY
D: You look gorgeous.
E: CONT’D
C: VIVI
D: Do I?
N: There’s that insecurity again. Lindsay has a maternal vibe toward Vivi, puts her arm around her protectively.
C: LINDSAY
D: Yes, you do. Always. You okay?
E: taking her in
C: VIVI
D: Long day. Need a drink. Rory’s with Graham up at the house. Is it just us for dinner?
N: (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 10. 12 CONTINUED: 12 Lindsay nods, hands out champagne. Vivi takes a big swig.
C: ANA
D: I’ll be a 5th wheel, as usual.
C: LINDSAY
D: Please. It’s not our fault you never bring a date. You could have all of Tinder here if you wanted.
C: ANA
D: I see your judgment. Don’t think I don’t.
C: LINDSAY
D: Honestly? I’m not judging. I’m jealous. You have sex with a new person every week!
C: ANA
D: Well, how long has it been for you and Graham?
C: LINDSAY
D: Three months? Maybe more?
E: cringes, then
C: VIVI
D: Wow. That’s--
C: ANA
D: A freakin’ emergency!! Linds, you need to go get screwed. Like now.
N: The girls know Lindsay’s marriage is troubled.
C: VIVI
D: You guys still seeing Dr. Lawrence?
C: LINDSAY
D: Couples therapy is a special kind of hell. But what else can we do?
N: Ana and V exchange looks, what do they know about marriage??
C: ANA
D: Have sex?
N: That breaks the tension. Lindsay laughs, Ana has a point. (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 11. 12 CONTINUED: (2) 12
C: LINDSAY
D: Alright, a toast. To Vivi being cancer-free for one year!
N: As they all raise their glasses to her, Vivi gets emotional. And and Lindsay look at her, concerned. She watches as the smiles fall from her friends’ faces.
C: ANA
D: V? You okay?
N: A beat -- is Vivi going to tell them what the doctor said?
C: VIVI
D: Look at you two, you’ve done way too much worrying about me over the past few years.
N: No -- she can’t tell them. Not now.
C: VIVI
D: I’m fine. It’s just that tonight puts everything in perspective. Life is short and you never know what’s gonna happen.
E: CONT’D
N: She swallows her emotion and covers with bright energy:
C: VIVI
D: Which is why I’m so excited to get my restaurant going. I can’t thank you enough for investing, Ana. When you think you can get me that cold hard cash, girl?
E: CONT’D
N: Yikes. Lindsay eyes Ana. Ana opens her mouth to tell her, but then sees something in Vivi's eyes. She can’t disappoint her.
C: ANA
D: Getting it in the next few days. I’m so excited to invest!
N: Lindsay shoots Ana a look -- She is??? WTF?
C: VIVI
D: Amazing. Okay, I have presents.
N: Vivi hands out 3 jewelry boxes.
C: ANA
D: Lindsay’s getting one too? She didn’t invest.
N: (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 12. 12 CONTINUED: (3) 12
C: VIVI
D: These are to thank you guys for sacrificing so much to be by my side in my fight against cancer. Linds, you left your own kids at home to be a mom to me in the hospital. I know my mother has been looking down and thanking you.
C: LINDSAY
D: Love you.
C: VIVI
D: Ana, you left work early too many times to yell at my doctors or sit at chemo with me. I hope it didn’t cost you anything--
N: Lindsay eyes Ana, knowing it did. Ana doesn’t miss a beat.
C: ANA
D: We’re just glad you didn’t die.
C: LINDSAY
D: Don’t say that!
C: VIVI
D: It’s okay. We’re all gonna die one day. That’s one thing we’ve learned from this. Okay, open them --
N: All three open their boxes to reveal BRACELETS, inscribed.
C: LINDSAY
D: “Choose happiness”
N: The SAME BRACELET that was on the DEAD BODY in our Teaser.
C: VIVI
D: It was something my mom said to my brothers and me every day before she died. It was basically her dying wish. So, with whatever time we all have left, can you guys promise to do that for me?
N: Ana and Vivi nod.
C: ANA
D: But if we’re going to promise, you have to, too.

C: EVERYONE
D: Happy 1-year cancerversary!
N: On Vivi, not entirely thrilled --

D: Oh! Wow, you guys said it was just a little dinner...

E: off her annoyed look
N: She’s definitely in a mood --

N: ANGLE ON EMILIO VASQUEZ, 50’s, and EDDIE and DANIEL, 20’s.
C: RORY
D: We have a lot to celebrate tonight: Vivi’s recovery, the future of her new restaurant. But I think we need one more thing to make it complete.
E: CONT’D
N: Vivi looks at him, uncertain. Rory points to Jamie, who hits the music: “I Say a Little Prayer” by Aretha Franklin.
C: VIVI
D: Our song...
N: “Forever and ever, you’ll stay in my heart, and I will love you...”
C: VIVI
D: Rory?
E: CONT’D
C: RORY
D: V, I fell in love with you when we were 16. But that was my little secret. I didn’t have the guts to tell you til 4 years ago. A year into our relationship, you got diagnosed with cancer. But even battling cancer, those years were the best of my life -- because I got to spend them with you. Seeing you get well has been my greatest joy. And I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.
N: “To live without you would only be heartbreak for me...” Now Rory’s down on one knee, with a ring--

D: Yes. Of course! Yes!

N: They hug. But we come around, we see the tension under Vivi’s smile, she’s keeping a big secret from her new fiancé... WE WHIRL AROUND THE PARTY AGAIN, LANDING ON-- ANA, clearly surprised by the engagement. She clocks RORY and LINDSAY’S PARENTS, TED and HELEN CRAWFORD, 60’s -- not thrilled. Ana crosses to them, defensive of Vivi.
C: ANA
D: Ted, Helen, your son just got engaged to the most amazing girl in Seaford, where are your smiles?
C: HELEN
D: Ana, dear, we’re over the moon.
N: Helen is the type of “polite” society woman who says one thing when she clearly means another. The lie infuriates Ana.
C: ANA
D: Good. Because Rory’s a very lucky man.
C: HELEN
D: And to think, if we hadn’t hired Vivian’s father as our driver all those years ago, this wonderful event might never have occurred.
N: At that, Ana accidentally on purpose spills a drink on Helen.
C: ANA
D: How clumsy! I am so sorry.
N: Off Ana, secret smile -- WE WHIRL AROUND THE PARTY TO: TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 16.

N: LINDSAY, on the sidelines, overseeing the party. She urges on a passing waiter, “pass those trays.” Everyone else is having fun, but Lindsay looks a little...empty. Now her husband, GRAHAM LEIGHTON, 40’s, serious-loooking, approaches, the tension between them evident before they say a word.
C: LINDSAY
D: Did you get the Juliet roses?
C: GRAHAM
D: Got the Tuscany instead. Just as nice, half the price.

D: Did the kids get to their sleepovers?
E: annoyed
C: GRAHAM
D: They didn’t want to go.
C: LINDSAY
D: Did you try?

D: Not hard enough by your standards, I’m sure.
N: Asshole. A waiter passes by, Linday chides him --

D: Don’t forget to offer a napkin.
N: Graham eyes her, then --
C: GRAHAM
D: Did that do it? Is the party perfect now?
C: LINDSAY

C: GRAHAM
D: Have you? Because God, I wish you would. So much.
N: Lindsay stares at him, willing him dead in her mind.
C: LINDSAY
D: It’s easy to make fun of me, Graham. But I wish I had known before we got married that I’d be running our business and our family on my own.
C: GRAHAM
D: Believe me, there are a lot of things I wish I’d known about you before I got married.
N: They stew in silence. Lindsay gazes across the room, at Vivi and Rory, in love. Deep breath. She turns to Graham, trying--
C: LINDSAY
D: Look, Dr. Lawrence said we should try more intimacy. I wanted the kids to do sleepovers so we could, you know... it’s been a while.
C: GRAHAM
D: So you wanna fuck me because Dr. Lawrence told you to? Something tells me I’m not gonna be in the mood. Looks like you’ll have to do that on your own too.
E: then
N: He stalks off, leaving Lindsay alone to swallow her angry tears. She grabs a drink from a passing waiter’s tray, gulps it down in a few long pulls. Grabs another one. TIME PASSES as she stands there, watching Ana, Jamie, Vivi, Rory across the room, her party whirling on without her. She finishes her 2nd drink. Yes, that definitely helps... Then, she gets a TEXT: “Look up.” She does. Across the room, in a shadowy, out of the way corner -- Can it be? It is. NICK. Wow. He cleans up well. Lindsay approaches him and smiles, beyond surprised that he showed up. TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 18.

D: Really. Who is she?

D: She’s this cool chick. Funny, smart, super sexy. We’ve been flirting for a while now. She’s got me all hot and bothered. I just have this feeling, tonight’s the night.

D: I was gonna start by putting my hand here, where no one can see it-- --then moving it up just a little further. See where things go from there.

Peers at her face -- last night, she had sex with someone other than her husband for the first time in 17 years. She heads into her (huge, Nancy Myers-esque) kitchen, pours coffee, daydreaming, as we POP TO:

N: Lindsay and Nick going at it, it’s sexy, he’s running his hands over her body --
C: GRAHAM
D: Can I get some?
E: V.O.
N: BACK TO SCENE -- Lindsay’s jolted back to reality as Graham walks to her, holding a mug.
C: GRAHAM
D: You came in late last night.
N: Lindsay searches his eyes, does he suspect anything? Just then their children, CHARLOTTE, 16, and MAC, 10, enter. Both have their heads buried in screens.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: 1 AM. I heard you.
C: LINDSAY
D: You were awake at 1 AM?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Hilary and Jake broke up. Major drama. You’re usually in bed by 9, Mom. What were you doing out until
C: 1 AM?
D: Ketamine?
E: sotto
C: LINDSAY
D: What? No! I was just... celebrating with Vivi and Ana.
N: Just then Lindsay’s phone with a GROUP TEXT from Ana and Vivi: “Where did you disappear to last night???” Shit. Lindsay snatches her phone off the counter, spilling her coffee. Graham eyes her as she fumbles to clean it up. (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 21. 20 CONTINUED: 20

D: I need some decent coffee.
E: CONT’D
N: She exits the kitchen as she replies to the ladies’ GROUP TEXT: “Coffee at 10 AM on Seaford Ave?” TAKING US TO --
S: 21 INT. JAMIE'S HOUSE - DAY (D2) 21
N: Ana replies “yes” to Lindsay’s text, and rolls over. We're surprised to find her in bed next to a sleeping Jamie. Ana grabs her clothes, she’s tip-toeing out when--
C: JAMIE
D: Sneaking out, huh?
C: ANA
D: Yeah.
C: JAMIE
D: I’ve been trying to make that happen for a long time. Why last night?
C: ANA
D: Engagements depress me. Sex was the only available distraction. We still on for that trade?
E: then
C: JAMIE
D: Look, Ana, I only brought that up to try to impress you -- and it looks like it worked, by the way. You sure you want to get involved in this?
C: ANA
D: I’m sure. Monday, right? Good. And Lim? Don’t start caring about me. It’s a huge turn off.
E: off his nod
N: The door slams -- she’s gone -- and we CUT TO: TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 22.

N: A CLOSED DOOR at the end of a hallway. PUSHING IN, we hear WHISPERING behind it. We want to hear what’s being said. GO INSIDE --
S: 23 INT. RORY AND VIVI’S COTTAGE - BATHROOM - DAY (D2) 23
N: -- to FIND Vivi, whispering into the phone.
C: VIVI
D: Then the tests were wrong. I don’t want to come in. Because. I’ve worked my ass off for this life, and now I just want to marry the man of my dreams and live happily ever after. So please, Beth, just leave me alone.
E: then then, firm
N: Sounds like our girl is in some serious denial. Just then, there’s a KNOCK at the door. It’s Rory on the other side.
C: RORY
D: V, you okay in there?
N: Vivi abruptly hangs up.
C: VIVI
D: I’m good. Just getting dressed. I’m going to go have a quick coffee with your sister and Ana, okay?
C: RORY
D: I get it, you three need to deconstruct last night...
C: VIVI
D: Totally. Every little detail.
N: OFF this, we GO TO--

D: You did not.
C: ANA
D: I wasn’t just gonna stand there while she disrespected Vivi.
C: LINDSAY
D: I’m sorry my parents are such a- holes to you, V. I don’t get it. Did anything happen between you guys?
E: then, curious
N: Is that a flicker of something in Vivi’s eyes?
C: VIVI
D: Not that I know of.
C: LINDSAY
D: I’m sure they’ll come around once you guys get married. Can you believe we’re going to be sisters- in-law?!
N: Vivi spots a BRIDAL SHOP, a gorgeous dress in the window. She can’t help but swoon. Lindsay follows her stare.
C: LINDSAY
D: Let’s go in!
E: CONT’D
N: Vivi’s melting, she SO wants to, but she’s conflicted. She looks at the dress like it’s a dream that won’t come true.
C: VIVI
D: No. No, I can’t.
N: Ana clearly isn’t interested, tries to keep walking--
C: LINDSAY
D: Why not? Of course you can!
T: OFF Vivi, relenting, CUT TO--

D: Uh, you disappeared. Where were you?
N: Errr, having a torrid affair? She eyes Ana. Should she tell her?? She leans in to Ana --
C: LINDSAY
D: Actually, I was...
N: Ana’s expectant, yes? ON Lindsay -- no, she can’t --
C: LINDSAY
D: The kids needed me. And don’t change the subject. Why didn’t you tell Vivi you don’t have the money?
E: CONT’D
C: ANA
D: Because I do.
C: LINDA
D: How? Where are you getting it?
C: ANA
D: Don’t worry about it, Mother Hen. I’ve got it handled. Did Rory tell you he was going to propose last night?
E: changing the subject
C: LINDSAY
D: No. I had no idea!
C: ANA
D: Well, maybe it’s not too late to change Vivi’s mind.
N: Lindsay fixes her with an annoyed stare.
C: LINDSAY
D: Look, I know you’re not a fan of my brother’s. I don’t know why since he’s the greatest guy in the world--
C: ANA
D: Please. The summer solstice party?
E: scoffs

C: LINDSAY
D: He didn’t--

D: --then Vivi deserves to know. No one in their right mind would stay with someone who cheated on them, can we at least agree on that?
N: Yikes. This lands on Lindsay as --

D: How’s it going in there, V?
E: CONT’D
N: We GO BEHIND THE CURTAIN TO --
S: 26 INT. BRIDAL SHOP DRESSING ROOM - BEHIND CURTAIN - DAY (D2) 26
N: Vivi, in a bra and underwear, looks at herself in a mirror.
C: VIVI
D: Fine. I’ll be out in a minute.
N: She eyes the dress. Strapless. She’ll need to take off her bra. She covers her breasts with her hands as she removes her bra. Doesn’t want to see herself. But even with her hands covering her breasts, we can see the deep line of angry scars crossing them. (After a double mastectomy and reconstruction, her breast are misshapen and scarred, with no nipples.) Finally, Vivi drops her hands. Stares at her mangled breasts. Angry. SO angry. At everything that’s been taken from her. Everything that’s going to be taken from her.
C: LINDSAY
D: We can’t wait to see you in it!
E: O.C
N: Vivi snaps out of it, grabs the dress as we go BACK TO --
S: 27 INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DRESSING ROOM - DAY (D2) 27
N: Lindsay’s PHONE BUZZES. She reads a TEXT FROM NICK: “Can't stop thinking about how sexy you are. When can I see you?” She blushes, smiles. Ana eyes her, then scootches over, trying to look at her phone. Lindsay JUMPS, hiding it.
C: LINDSAY
D: Hey! What are you--?
N: (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 26. 27 CONTINUED: 27

D: Ah ha! Now I know where Lindsay disappeared to last night...
C: LINDSAY
D: What are you talking about?!
C: ANA
D: You’re blushing! And glowing! That dam must have really burst, huh? How is Graham in bed anyway?
C: LINDSAY
D: I’m not going to kiss and tell.
E: stammers
C: ANA
D: Fine, then I will. Jamie was surprisingly adept.
C: LINDSAY
D: You went home with Jamie?
N: At that news, Vivi peeks her head out --
C: VIVI
D: What? You did?
N: Vivi, still mostly behind the curtain, points to her back to be buttoned. Lindsay starts buttoning the many buttons, it’ll take a minute. We still can’t see the dress.
C: LINDSAY
D: I thought you weren’t going to cross that line, since you guys are friends. And you work together.
C: ANA
D: Well, I did, Judgy Judgers. And it’s not like it’s a thing. One and done, babies.
C: VIVI
D: I don’t get it, Ana. Since freshman year of college, you’ve never dated anyone for more than a week.
C: ANA
D: Wrong. Remember that sorority girl? Spring break in Miami?
N: (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 27. 27 CONTINUED: (2) 27
C: VIVI
D: Fine. Two weeks. Why don’t you want to settle down with a nice girl or guy?
C: ANA
D: Look, ladies, monogamy is not only boring as hell, it’s a delusion topped only by marriage, which is emotionally, financially, and categorically inane. In fact, V, the best thing you could do for yourself right now is take off that dress, tell Rory the engagement’s off, and buy yourself a nice vibrator.
C: VIVI
D: Then I guess you’ve never been in love. Because when you really love someone, you’ll do anything to hold onto that person.
N: ON Vivi -- realizing she’s speaking some truth about herself. Meanwhile, Ana takes that in.
C: ANA
D: Maybe you’re right. I guess, deep down, I assume I’m never going to end up with my forever person. I close myself off because I’m afraid of putting myself out there.
N: Lindsay and Vivi are both shocked, Ana’s never been that open with them. Then Ana bursts out laughing--
C: ANA
D: Is that the sappy answer you guys wanted to hear? Now can we move on?
E: CONT’D
N: Lindsay finishes the buttons and Vivi steps out in the gown and a veil. She’s quintessentially bridal -- and drop dead GORGEOUS. They all look at her in the mirror.
C: VIVI
D: So? What do you guys think?
C: LINDAY
D: Oh, Vivi, it’s stunning. I wish your mom was here to see this.
N: (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 28. 27 CONTINUED: (3) 27 Vivi stares at herself -- the dress is perfect. But the look in her eyes is bittersweet. Will she ever get to do this? Ana stares at Vivi, breathless, totally taken in --
C: ANA
D: V, you’re... epically gorgeous.
N: At that, Vivi turns and walks toward Ana with a smile, it’s reminiscent of a wedding procession.
C: VIVI
D: Thanks. And you can joke all you want, Ana. But I think there’s truth to what you said. You are scared. But you are also epically wonderful. And anyone would be lucky to be with you.
N: Vivi takes the veil from her head, positions it on Ana’s, staring her in the eyes.
C: VIVI
D: One day, Ana, it’s gonna happen.
E: CONT’D
N: Vivi smiles as Ana blushes uncomfortably, and we realize something: ANA HAS FEELINGS FOR VIVI. ANGLE ON Lindsay, clocking this. Is she seeing what she thinks she’s seeing? Yep, she is: her best friend has feelings for other best friend, who happens to be her brother’s fiance’. Yikes. OFF Lindsay, we TIME CUT TO:
S: 28 EXT. SEAFORD SHOPPING STREET - SIDEWALK - DAY (D2) 28
N: The ladies say goodbye on the sidewalk. As Vivi heads off, Lindsay stops Ana. She chooses her words carefully.
C: LINDSAY
D: Ana, I know how much you love Vivi, we all love her. But... however you’re getting this investment money -- I hope you’re not going into debt for her or anything.
C: ANA
D: I said don’t worry about it.
E: taken aback
N: Lindsay gently continues, this is more delicate -- (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 29. 28 CONTINUED: 28
C: LINDSAY
D: Okay. Well, the other thing is -- in there, going on about how horrible marriage is, telling V to end the engagement...? Vivi is in love with my brother, she wants to marry him, and you probably should accept that.
N: Ana fixes her with a stare.
C: ANA
D: Look, Mother Hen, Vivi and I may be a few years younger than you, but we’re big girls and we can make our own decisions. And you and Graham aren’t exactly killing it as role models. So if I were you, I’d take a hard look at my own soulless marriage before I gave anyone else relationship advice.

D: Don’t worry, I’m not gonna bite.
E: CONT’D
N: Lindsay stands --
C: LINDSAY
D: Nick Wolfson, do you know my husband, Graham Leighton?
N: REVEAL GRAHAM, working nearby. Lindsay is FREAKING OUT, her eyes wide as she looks to Nick, but he covers well--
C: NICK
D: Sure, I think I’ve seen you around town. You’re the flower guy, right?
C: GRAHAM
D: Landscape designer.
C: NICK
D: And you do a bang up job. Think it was you who planted those daisies outside the women’s club?
N: Was that a dig? Sure felt like one.
C: GRAHAM
D: I take it you’re working with Lindsay on the Jacksons’ remodel.
C: NICK
D: Yeah, I’m one of the new contractors.

C: ANA
D: If what you say is true, and that drug gets FDA approval, MedCo’s price will skyrocket, while it’s unlikely that we’ll get caught. But if we do? Prison, career up in flames, reputations ruined.

N: She gets emotional.
C: VIVI
D: The doctors say I won’t be able to have children.
C: RORY
D: I still love you and I still want to marry you.
C: VIVI
D: I hid it from you.
C: RORY
D: I still love you and I still want to marry you.
C: VIVI
D: I fantasized about murdering Dr. Beth in her sleep just now.
C: RORY
D: Still love you. Still want to marry you.
N: A beat -- she wants to believe him -- then --
C: VIVI
D: You say all this now. But you need time to think it over.

D: Wait until it sinks in that you can’t have your own children.
E: 2 CONT'D
C: RORY
D: We will have our own children. We’ll adopt them. Or use an egg donor. I don’t care. All I care about is raising them with you. V, I would fight through anything -- fertility issues, cancer, my parents, your best friend -- to be with you.
N: He just doesn’t understand --
C: RORY
D: What is stopping you from believing that?
E: CONT’D
C: VIVI
D: I don’t know. All I know is, when we fell in love, my life turned into a fairy tale.
N: Rory smiles. Then she continues --
C: VIVI
D: But I just have this terrible feeling that one day, it’s all going to come crashing down.
E: CONT’D
N: Rory’s taken aback --
C: RORY
D: V, it won’t. Come here.
N: He takes her in his arms. Off Vivi, closing her eyes, savoring his protective hug. But as she opens her eyes, we have a sense of foreboding, which TAKES US ACROSS TO --
S: 54 EXT. RORY AND VIVI’S COTTAGE - NIGHT (N5) 54
N: Vivi’s exiting the house, surprised to find Helen Crawford, Rory’s mother, in the shadows of the driveway.
C: VIVI
D: Helen?
C: HELEN
D: Evening, Vivian.
N: (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 63. 54 CONTINUED: 54
C: VIVI
D: I’m just on my way out to the restaurant.
C: HELEN
D: It’s fine. I’m here to see Rory.
C: VIVI
D: Okay, well, nice to see you.
N: Vivi’s about to go, but then, emboldened by her talk with Rory, she turns bravely to Helen --
C: VIVI
D: Helen. I don’t know what I did to get on your bad side. But Rory made it very clear to me tonight that he wants a life with me, no matter what. I’m going to be part of your family.
E: CONT’D
N: Helen smiles at her nicely.
C: HELEN
D: Sweet girl. Ever since you were little, when your father started working for us, and you’d help him wash our cars or sweep out our garage, you’ve always been so exceedingly bright.
N: Vivi smiles. This is going well. But then Helen continues--
C: HELEN
D: So it can’t come as a surprise to you that I will never let that happen.
E: CONT’D
N: Vivi flashes with anger. She moves toward Helen--
C: VIVI
D: I’d watch how you speak to me.
N: Vivi drops her voice, this is furtive, mysterious --
C: VIVI
D: Summer solstice?
E: CONT’D
N: There’s that summer solstice party again -- the same one where Ana claims Rory was up to no good... (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 64. 54 CONTINUED: (2) 54
C: VIVI
D: I know what happened that night. Upstairs at your house. I was there.
E: CONT’D
N: Vivi lets that land. But Helen doesn’t blink.
C: HELEN
D: Actually, there are quite a few things you don’t know about that night. Things you won’t want to know. So I’d forget whatever you think you saw.
N: Helen heads inside, then stops, turns back --
C: HELEN
D: Oh, and by the way, Vivian, what exactly were you doing in our house that night?
E: CONT’D
N: With that, Helen goes. OFF Vivi, head spinning, CUT TO--
S: 55 INT. VASQUEZ FAMILY HOME - LIVING ROOM 55
N: Vivi furtively enters her childhood home, not making a sound. No one’s home. She goes to her mother’s shrine, feels around behind it. Ah ha. She pulls something that was hidden behind the shrine, tucks it away in her purse. Kisses her fingers and then touches her mother’s photo with her fingers. Exits --
S: 56 INT. VIVI'S RESTAURANT SPACE - NIGHT (N5) 56
N: --and enters her restaurant space. We follow her through the main dining area and kitchen, into a small office, where she opens a closet door, revealing a SAFE. She takes the item out of her purse -- a small package wrapped in black -- puts it in the safe, locks it. As she stares at the locked safe, we FLASHBACK POP TO:
S: 57 INT. HELEN AND TED’S HOUSE - HALLWAY/BEDROOM - FLASHBACK 57
N: We see fragmented POPS: Vivi walks furtively along a hallway. She’s stopped by unsettling noises behind a door. Grunts and groans. Sex? An argument? Vivi edges closer. Hears a thump. Peers through the crack, sees a horrified Ted Crawford staring at something. Before we see what it is -- BACK TO SCENE. Vivi shakes her head, wishing she could forget that memory, as we CUT TO: TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 65.
S: 58 EXT. VIVI’S RESTAURANT SPACE - NIGHT (N5) 58
N: A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA being plopped on a table. A subdued Lindsay, Ana and Vivi sit on the patio, overlooking the water. As Vivi pours the shots--
C: VIVI
D: Thanks for coming tonight, ladies.
N: Vivi raises her glass to toast, but before she can -- a stressed Ana and Lindsay both shoot theirs back.
C: VIVI
D: Good plan.
E: CONT’D
N: Vivi throws hers back, too. Pours three more.
C: VIVI
D: So, I picked a name for my restaurant. Tres Amigas.
E: CONT’D
C: ANA
D: Love.
C: LINDSAY It’s perfect, V.
D: So, you need our advice on how to tell Rory?
E: then
C: VIVI
D: Nope. He knows. And he was very understanding. We’re still getting married.
E: off their looks
N: Lindsay’s relieved and pleased. Ana, less so. Lindsay raises a glass --
C: LINDSAY
D: Well, I guess it just goes to show, secrets are never a good idea.
N: Ana raises her glass --
C: ANA
D: True. Better to bare your soul.
N: Vivi joins in -- (CONTINUED) TIES THAT BIND - Shaw - Studio Draft - 11/27/20 66. 58 CONTINUED: 58
C: VIVI
D: One hundred percent. Honesty, always.
N: All three of them shoot their shots. Then, they look out at the view, each lost in her own world of worry -- ON ANA -- covering major anxiety about her crime... ON LINDSAY -- unsure of what Nick will do next... ON VIVI -- holding the darkest secret of them all... ON ALL 3 OF OUR LADIES, their secrets firmly intact -- for now -- staring out into that DARK WATER, we SMASH TO BLACK. END OF PILOT
