D:                   secret. I didn’t have the guts to

D:                   into our relationship, you got
D:                   diagnosed with cancer. But even
D:                   battling cancer, those years were
D:                   the best of my life -- because I
D:                   got to spend them with you. Seeing

N:      Ana and Jamie huddle together in a glass conference room,
N:      illuminated by the glow of Ana’s laptop. Ana stares at the

D:                I know what happened that night.
D:                Upstairs at your house. I was
D:                there.

N:      Vivi lets that land. But Helen doesn’t blink.

D:                Actually, there are quite a few
D:                things you don’t know about that
D:                night. Things you won’t want to
D:                know. So I’d forget whatever you
D:                think you saw.

D:                exactly were you doing in our house
D:                that night?

N:      Vivi furtively enters her childhood home, not making a sound.
N:      No one’s home. She goes to her mother’s shrine, feels around
N:      behind it. Ah ha. She pulls something that was hidden behind
N:      the shrine, tucks it away in her purse. Kisses her fingers
N:      and then touches her mother’s photo with her fingers. Exits --

N:      main dining area and kitchen, into a small office, where she
N:      opens a closet door, revealing a SAFE. She takes the item out
N:      of her purse -- a small package wrapped in black -- puts it
N:      in the safe, locks it. As she stares at the locked safe, we

N:      We see fragmented POPS: Vivi walks furtively along a hallway.
N:      She’s stopped by unsettling noises behind a door. Grunts and
N:      groans. Sex? An argument? Vivi edges closer. Hears a thump.
N:      Peers through the crack, sees a horrified Ted Crawford
N:      staring at something. Before we see what it is --

N:      Lindsay, Ana and Vivi sit on the patio, overlooking the

D:                He knows. And he was very
D:                understanding. We’re still getting
D:                married.
