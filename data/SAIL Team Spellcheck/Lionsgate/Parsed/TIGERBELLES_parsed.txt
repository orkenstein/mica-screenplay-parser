S: EXT. WILMA’S YARD - RURAL TENNESSEE - DAY (1947)
N: YOUNG WILMA RUDOLPH (aka “Skeeter”), 7, and her older sister YOUNG CHARLENE, 12, playfully collect laundry hanging on a line. In the background is the Rudolph family home... large, but slightly dilapidated wooden house/farm in the midst of the swath of green land.
C: YOUNG WILMA
D: Betcha can’t beat me back! Charlene waves her off and continues gathering clothes.
C: YOUNG CHARLENE
D: You got them little legs.
C: YOUNG WILMA
D: I’m still faster than you. A shirt that Wilma’s collecting skims the ground.
C: YOUNG CHARLENE
D: Skeeter, you better pick them clean clothes up off the ground! Mama’ll kill you! As Wilma gathers the clothes in her arms, Charlene gets a mischievous glint in her eyes.
C: YOUNG CHARLENE Mark... set... GO!
D: Charlene takes off running with a basket full of laundry. Wilma chases after her, laughing the whole way. Despite her small size, she’s amazingly quick. Suddenly, Wilma STUMBLES and falls directly into a muddy pile. The clean laundry’s filthy. Charlene sprints back.
E: CONT’D
C: YOUNG CHARLENE
D: Mama’s gonna lick you good. She tries to help Wilma up, but her legs are rubbery.
E: CONT’D
C: YOUNG CHARLENE
D: C’mon, Skeeter. Stand up.
E: CONT’D
C: YOUNG WILMA
D: I’m trying to.
C: YOUNG CHARLENE
D: C’mon, Wilma, this ain’t funny.
E: growing concerned
N: Wilma looks to her big sister, then down to her immobile legs. Her little brow furrows with worry.
C: YOUNG CHARLENE
D: Mama! Mama! EXT. US ROUTE 79 / INT. OLDSMOBILE - MOMENTS LATER A rust-caked OLDSMOBILE speeds erratically along a country road dotted with LIVESTOCK and BLACK SHARECROPPERS working the fields. BLANCHE RUDOLPH, late 30s, grasps the wheel tightly as she drives. Charlene sways with each jerky turn of the car. Wilma lays stiff-as-a-board across her lap. EXT. MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE - LATER The Oldsmobile SCREECHES to a halt in front of the hospital.
E: CONT’D
C: YOUNG WILMA
D: Mama, am I gonna be okay?
C: BLANCHE
D: Skeeter, you gon’ be back out there running with your brothers and sisters in no time. A doctor’s gonna fix you up like new. Wilma’s not so convinced. Blanche isn’t really either, so Charlene takes a stab.
C: YOUNG CHARLENE
D: And guess what? He’s gonna be Colored just like you. Wilma raises her eyebrows in disbelief. Blanche takes Wilma’s chin in her hand, Wilma’s eyes towards hers.
C: BLANCHE
D: You my little fighter, you know that? Scarlet Fever? Beat it. Double-pneumonia? Beat it. And you gon’ beat this too. You know why?
C: YOUNG WILMA
D: Why?
C: BLANCHE
D: Cause you’re a Rudolph. That’s what we do. Charlene curls Wilma’s hand into a FIGHTING FIST. She wraps her own hand around it. Sisters in this fight together. CUT TO: WILMA’S MIND’S EYE: A SERIES of STYLIZED SHOTS, the SOUND FADING IN AND OUT.
S: INT. MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE - DAY
N: - Wilma’s on a cold metal table. A BLACK DOCTOR and NURSE fit METAL BRACES on her legs. She winces in pain. -SLAM! The heavy lid of the IRON LUNG MACHINE is shut down on Wilma’s small body. She finds herself in DARKNESS. -SNAP! The BLACK DOCTOR fastens the rigid BRACES below Young Wilma’s knobby knees. She forces a clumsy step. - Charlene and Blanche look through a window as a NURSE exercises Wilma’s legs in a shallow pool.
S: EXT. WILMA’S YARD - RURAL TENNESSEE - MORNING
N: Wilma sits in a makeshift wagon while Charlene massages her legs. Blanche oversees the FAMILY construction of a homemade polio contraption. Wilma grits through a tiresome, clunky walk along the PARALLEL BARS. She glances up seeing a group of KIDS at the end of the road staring with confusion. Wilma stops and Blanche sees the gossiping Kids. She redirects Wilma’s attention to focus on the task at hand. Charlene matches Wilma step-for-step, while the whole FAMILY cheers her on at the end of the bars... an official finish line.
S: EXT. WILMA’S YARD - RURAL TENNESSEE - DAY
N: Wilma toys with her cumbersome brace as she stares out at her Brothers and Sisters playing basketball on the homemade dirt court. Her eyes hone in on their youthful and agile legs scurrying on the court.
S: EXT. WILMA’S YARD - RURAL TENNESSEE - DUSK
N: Wilma’s Family walks toward their house in the distance. Charlene and Wilma remain in the distance at the parallel bars. Blanche yells out from the PORCH.
C: BLANCHE
D: Wilma! Charlene! Supper time!
C: YOUNG CHARLENE
D: Just a few more minutes, Mama! Wilma stares at the BRACES on her legs. Mind racing.
C: YOUNG WILMA
D: Take ‘em off, Charlene.
C: YOUNG CHARLENE
D: You not ready yet. And Mama’ll be mad as all get out.
C: YOUNG WILMA
D: Mama said I can beat whatever comes my way. Take ‘em off. Hesitant, Charlene unstraps the BRACES. They hit the ground with a heavy THUD. Wilma, unsteady, wills her legs to move. Her face is full of pure grit and determination. She stumbles, Charlene moves to steady her. Trying again, Wilma takes a few wobbly steps before falling on her face. This time, she holds up her hand to stop Charlene. She pulls herself back to her feet, takes a shaky step, and then another, and then another. Charlene breaks into a proud and awe-filled grin. ANGLE ON: The BRACES, sitting like discarded shells in the dirt, as Wilma’s LEGS gain strength and speed in the background. MATCH CUT TO: INT. WILMA’S HOUSE - DAY CLOSE ON: The BRACES sit dusty on a closet shelf, as we pull back to reveal WILMA, 18, pretty but serious with eyes mature beyond her years. Overwhelmed, she balances her daughter, YOLANDA, 1, on her hips while tossing items in a suitcase. Wilma’s FAMILY OF 21 KIDS bustle about, helping her pack. ED RUDOLPH, 50s, dressed in a PORTER’S UNIFORM, breezes by.
E: 1958
C: ED RUDOLPH
D: Now don’t forget your coat, girl!
C: WILMA I won’t, Daddy.
D: CHARLENE, 23, a no frills woman, hands Wilma a PHOTOGRAPH.
C: CHARLENE
D: Here it go. INSERT PICTURE: Wilma doting a newborn Yolanda with kisses. Wilma smiles and makes funny faces at Yolanda who manages a little smile in return.
C: WILMA
D: You gonna miss mama? Mama’s gonna miss you. Guilt wafts over her face. Charlene doesn’t miss this.
C: CHARLENE
D: Don’t go letting out no more tears. You done cried two rivers worth and it ain’t changing the fact that you gotta go. Yolanda starts to whimper. Wilma sniffs her diaper. She puts her on the bed and starts to change her.
C: WILMA
D: Leaving y’all to carry the load while I’m at school... it don’t feel right, Charlene.
C: CHARLENE
D: You act like you finna go living high and party with stars. College ain’t no vacation. You gon’ be working on your education and we all gonna work on raising Yolanda.
C: WILMA
D: It still don’t feel right.
C: CHARLENE
D: Neither does cleaning white folks’ houses. As Charlene crosses the room to trash the dirty diaper, Wilma glances back at the BRACES in the closet. She goes still.
C: WILMA
D: What if I can’t keep up with the other girls?
C: CHARLENE
D: You the fastest person I done ever saw, Skeeter.
C: WILMA
D: Not faster than Jesse. I can’t outrun cars.
C: CHARLENE
D: I bet if we put you next to Mama’s car you’d be.
C: WILMA
D: That’s only cause it’s raggedy. They chuckle as Charlene gives her a hug. She gives Wilma a long look.
C: CHARLENE
D: Skeeter, you got a window of opportunity.
E: MORE
C: CHARLENE
D: Don’t try to find a way to pull down the shade. You gotta show your shine.
E: CONT'D
C: ED RUDOLPH
D: Robert’s here! Wilma carefully puts the PHOTOGRAPH of her and Yolanda in her suitcase. Charlene grabs some bags and follows Wilma through the hustle and bustle of the house. EXT. WILMA’S HOUSE - PORCH - SAME TIME ROBERT ELDRIDGE, 18, a handsome, sweet-natured country boy gets out of a battered farm PICKUP TRUCK. Wilma’s YOUNGER SIBLINGS flock to him. He happily gives them attention. He gives a courtesy nod to Ed and Blanche Rudolph.
E: O.S.
C: ROBERT
D: Afternoon, Ma’am... Sir.
C: ED RUDOLPH
D: Hey there, Robert. Robert skirts through the playful Kids, eyes only on Wilma.
C: CHARLENE
D: And you don’t see me standing over here, huh?
E: playful
C: ROBERT
D: Good Lord, Charlene. Gimme a chance, wouldya? She laughs as Robert finally makes his way in front of Wilma, heavily smitten. He tickles Yolanda in Wilma’s arms.
E: good heartedly
C: ROBERT
D: Hey, Skeeter. He gives her a tender kiss on the cheek.
E: CONT’D
C: BLANCHE
D: Alright, enough of that there.
C: ROBERT
D: I’m being good, Mrs. Rudolph.
C: BLANCHE
D: You better be. Yolanda squeals as Robert continues to tickle her.
C: BLANCHE
D: One baby is enough, don’t you say?
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: Mama. Blanche purses her lips, standing by her statement. Avoiding this conversation, Robert grabs Wilma’s suitcases and loads them into the truck. Ed Rudolph hands Wilma an ENVELOPE. Wilma looks inside to find a small STACK OF CASH.
C: WILMA
D: Daddy, no. I can’t take this.
E: CONT’D
C: ED RUDOLPH
D: Naw, now. Everybody pitched in where they could. The lil’ ones even picked corn on Johnson’s farm.
C: BLANCHE
D: And I sold my washing machine.
C: WILMA
D: Mama! No, get it back. You saved up to get that machine.
C: BLANCHE
D: We gonna make do over here, Skeeter. That running scholarship the school giving you ain’t gon’ cover everything.
C: ED RUDOLPH
D: Now you be careful down there in Nashville. Mind Coach Temple and your manners. And don’t be sassing no white folks. Wilma hugs her Family. She holds Yolanda tightly in her arms.
C: WILMA
D: Be a good girl now. She fights letting the tears in her eyes fall, but she can’t stop the outpouring. Robert and Charlene look to one another, each sympathetically watching this goodbye. Wilma hands Yolanda off to Charlene before climbing in Robert’s truck. Her Family waves goodbye as Robert’s truck pulls away, leaving her world behind. He flips on the radio. The Drifter’s “There Goes My Baby” comes on. EXT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH, CAPITOL HILL - DAY This is the quintessential Southern Black Church. COACH ED TEMPLE, 38, opens the station wagon trunk revealing several BOOKS in BOXES. Ed’s stoic both in stature and attitude until...
E: NASHVILLE
N: he looks into the rearview mirror meeting eyes with C.B. TEMPLE, 36, who playfully winks at him while putting on lipstick. She’s the honey to Ed’s vinegar.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I think you got enough of that gunk on, don’t you?
E: teasing
C: C.B.
D: A lady’s presentation is always a direct representation of her man. C.B. looks in the side mirror and adjusts her hat. Perfect.
C: C.B.
D: And I’d say that the world thinks you’re pretty put together. Ed chuckles and grabs one of the boxes from the back of the trunk. She gets out and he takes in her beauty.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: If the ladies who taught me how to read looked like you, I wouldn’t be able to spell ‘go.’ Folks are gonna be looking more at you than at that chalkboard.
C: C.B.
D: I think they’ll manage just fine. C.B. gives him a kiss. In the background, a FRUMPY WOMAN overloaded with bags struggles with the church door.
C: C.B.
D: Hold on, Sister! Here I come! As C.B. climbs the stairs to help the Frumpy Woman, a HEFTY MAN with wrinkled clothes, hustles to get the door for C.B. She turns back to Ed with an “I told you so” smirk. He smiles to himself as he hauls the box inside. EXT. DOWNTOWN NASHVILLE - DAY Robert’s truck makes its way through downtown. Well-dressed MEN and WOMEN make their way in-and-out of stores. Wilma takes it all in. WILMA’S POV: A perfectly made-up BLACK MOTHER and DAUGHTER stand beneath a department store sign that reads COLORED ENTRANCE. It’s the city, but it’s still the Jim Crow South.
E: CONT’D to the Frumpy Woman
S: INT. ROBERT’S PICKUP TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
N: Wilma anxiously taps her foot. Robert sees she’s nervous and sweetly reaches over and takes her hand as the truck pulls past a sign that reads: TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY.
S: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - SAME TIME
N: CLOSE ON: A pair of large, masculine BLACK HANDS pours chalk into a CHALK LINER MACHINE. CLOSE ON: An imperceptibly CROOKED CHALKLINE is rubbed out by a MAN’S FOOT, then replaced. A perfectionist. CLOSE ON: A WHISTLE, CLIPBOARD, STOPWATCH, NOTEPAD full of notes, and a SCALE are unpacked from a crate. CAMERA TILTS UP to reveal Ed appraising his immaculate contributions to an otherwise unkempt track. This is the place where Ed is ALL vinegar. He grimaces as he eyes the partially completed track: it’s missing the last two turns leaves it in the shape of a U. As Robert’s pickup truck drives past, Ed locks eyes with Wilma in the front seat. Wilma offers a shy wave. Ed sternly acknowledges her with a tight nod. Ed’s attention drifts across the yard... MARVIN JOHNSON, 38, the men’s football and track coach, oversees a THREE-MAN GROUNDS CREW carefully attending to Men’s Field. Ed, with zero help, goes back to pushing his chalk liner.
S: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - CAMPUS - SAME TIME
N: Robert’s truck winds through campus. Smartly put together BLACK STUDENTS walk along the paved paths. Some STUDENTS converse on the grass. Other Kids electrify with laughter at tables in the QUAD. A few GUYS toss a football back and forth.
S: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - HALE HALL - SAME TIME
N: Handsome brick buildings surround a well-manicured courtyard. Wilma and Robert park next to a Lincoln sedan.
C: AT THE LINCOLN
D: A cute, well-coiffed and full-figured student, BARBARA JONES, 18, is surrounded by a dozen leather suitcases. Her HEN- PECKING MOTHER, late 40s, and DOTING FATHER, late 40s, buzz around her. As Barbara starts to pick up a heavy box...
C: BARBARA'S FATHER
D: Let me get that for you, baby. Young women shouldn't be doing heavy lifting.
N: He scans the yard and notices a group of MALE COLLEGE STUDENTS. Among them is the suave and preppy kid, WENDELL, 19, causally leaning against a car checking out the Freshmen.
C: BARBARA'S FATHER
D: Hey! You boys wanna make a couple of bucks? He takes a billfold from his pocket and the Boys hurry over to pick up the mountain of luggage. Barbara catches Wendell’s attention. He shoots a flirty grin. She happily reciprocates.
E: CONT’D
C: AT ROBERT’S PICKUP TRUCK
D: Wilma has been watching all of this.
C: WILMA
D: Must be nice. Robert playfully flexes a bit.
C: ROBERT
D: Them lil’ boys? You got all the muscle you need right here. With a wink, he takes Wilma’s suitcase from her. Suddenly, a BLARE of R&B music approaches. A shiny black CADILLAC pulls up beside Wilma. A leggy, red- headed vixen climbs out. This is BILLIE WHITE, 21, grown as she wanna be and a tad intimidating. The OLDER-LOOKING MAN in the Cadillac pulls off. All heads turn as Billie struts past the Freshmen.
C: BILLIE
D: What? Never seen a senior before? Wilma gets a kick out of that. She turns to Robert.
C: WILMA
D: I ain’t never seen that type of woman before. INT. HALE HALL - WILMA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Lugging a suitcase, Robert walks in the room to see Wilma tentatively unpacking a bag. Wilma can’t help but to peek over at Barbara and her family across the room. Barbara's Father organizes the desk while Barbara’s Mother places an ornate bedspread on the bed. Barbara’s not doing a thing... other than checking her makeup in the mirror. Robert and Wilma exchange a glance: This girl is spoiled.
C: BARBARA’S MOTHER
D: ...now the sorority usually takes a line early spring.
E: MORE
C: BARBARA’S MOTHER
D: You’re legacy, so you have one foot in the door, but you still need to do your part. Wilma’s bag accidentally falls to the floor sending the PHOTOGRAPH of her and Yolanda across the floor. Barbara finally moves from her throne and beats Wilma to the picture.
E: CONT'D
C: BARBARA
D: Who’s this? Polite, Wilma swiftly takes the photo from Barbara.
C: WILMA
D: That’s my sister’s daughter.
C: BARBARA
D: Well, aren’t you a good auntie? Mu-- Wilma jumps in to change the subject.
C: WILMA
D: Looks like we're roommates. I'm...
C: ELEANOR
D: Wilma? A bookish, intelligent looking upperclassman, ELEANOR WILLIAMS, 22, calls from the doorway. She checks names off her clipboard.
E: O.S.
C: WILMA
D: Yes, but you can call me Skeeter. Barbara’s Parents give each other a side-eye over the nickname. Eleanor merely continues her checklist.
C: ELEANOR
D: And... you must be Barbara.
C: BARBARA
D: Yes, and you are...
C: ELEANOR
D: Eleanor. Coach Temple wants you on the track at four p.m. sharp.
C: WILMA
D: Today? I haven't even unpacked yet. Eleanor finally looks up from her clipboard.
C: ELEANOR
D: Wilma, you’re here on a scholarship, right?
C: WILMA
D: Yes.
C: ELEANOR
D: Then you’re on Coach’s time now.
C: BARBARA
D: I’m not on scholarship. Eleanor gives Barbara and her Family a solid once over.
E: to herself
C: ELEANOR
D: I suggest neither of you be late. Eleanor walks away. Wilma turns to Barbara who resumes primping in the mirror.
C: WILMA
D: You run track?
C: BARBARA'S FATHER
D: Oh, BJ runs alright. You are looking at the fastest young lady in the whole state of Illinois. Barbara gives Wilma a brazen smirk. Competition is on. EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - CAMPUS - AFTERNOON Wilma, in a long baggy T-shirt and frumpy shorts, jogs slowly. Next to her is Barbara in a polished, form-fitting track uniform with CHICAGO scrawled across the chest. They run through campus, passing STUDENTS on the TENNIS COURTS and DRUM MAJORS practicing their signature moves. EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - SAME TIME Wilma and Barbara, competitors at the core, glance at each other then start jogging faster and faster until finally they are full-on RACING each other. They arrive at the track breathless just as... Ed BLOWS his WHISTLE. A DOZEN ATHLETES surround him, including Billie and Eleanor.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Welcome to your first Tigerbelles practice. I'm Ed Temple. You can call me ‘Coach.’ Ed’s manner is precise and no-nonsense.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: This is Eleanor Williams.
E: CONT’D motioning to Eleanor MORE
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: She’s my assistant coach and a graduate student here. She’s also your teammate, but you’re expected to treat her with respect of a coach. Ed takes in Barbara’s uniform, non-approving.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You may’ve been hot stuff where you came from, but none of that matters here. You are all at the same starting line. Barbara subconsciously fidgets with her uniform.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: There are no secured spots on this team. If you’ve been offered a scholarship, don’t mistake that for easy sailing. Wilma shuffles nervously.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You’re expected to be at every practice early. If you’re showing up as my whistle blows, you’re late. We might all be Colored, but my watch doesn’t run on C-P time. Tigerbelles do not slack off on their school work. Remember you are using track in exchange for an education. I expect y’all to maintain at least a three-point- five G.P.A. Curfew is nine p.m. Billie guffaws out loud, then stifles it. Ed scowls, pointedly looking at Billie.
E: CONT’D then
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Athletics open up doors for you, but education keeps them open. Tigerbelles should look presentable at all times. You are ladies first, students second, and athletes third. I expect for you to be foxes not oxes. Wilma and Barbara glance at one another.
E: CONT’D then
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You all represent this university, but more specifically you represent me. Is all of that clear?
E: CONT’D
N: Wilma, Barbara, and the rest of the FRESHMAN RUNNERS stand shocked, overwhelmed. Billie feigns a yawn behind Ed’s back.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Alright. Line up for weigh in. Wilma whispers to Barbara.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: Scales? Is he serious?
C: BARBARA
D: I'm not getting on a scale. Ed brings out a SCALE. Eleanor lines everyone up. CUT TO: BILLIE, who jumps on and jumps off. No problem. Ed looks down the line.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Miss Jones, you're next.
C: BARBARA
D: I was taught ladies never reveal their age or their weight. Ed, barely looking up from his notepad, motions with his pen for Barbara to get on the scale.
C: BARBARA
D: I've always watched my waistline. Is this really necessary?
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: We need to get those hips in runner shape. This isn't a cotillion. Get on the scale. Ed inspects the number, raises an eyebrow.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You're one cookie away. Miss Rudolph. Hesitant, Wilma steps on the scale. Ed squints in concentration.
E: CONT’D down the line
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Stand up straight. He adjusts Wilma’s posture. Ed reads the scale and takes Wilma in for the first time.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Looks like you’ve put on some weight since recruitment last year.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: I... I know. I'm gonna lose it. Wilma shrinks back into the Team. Ed CHIRPS his whistle.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: My runners need to be in top shape. If you wanna keep your scholarship, you’re gonna need to put in work.
C: BARBARA
D: I’m not on scholarship. Eleanor and Billie are in earshot; they roll their eyes.
E: under her breath
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Alright. Today’s warmup will also be the first cut. Wilma and Barbara’s jaws drop.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Get on the track and loosen up your legs with two miles. Anyone over fifteen minutes... thank you for coming out, but this will be your first and last practice. The GIRLS begin running on Ed’s whistle. Each Girl has a unique running style. Billie’s stride is nonchalant, but powerful. Eleanor’s steady and calculated. Barbara’s gait is showy and slick. Wilma’s long legs make her look as though she is gliding on ice. Billie leads the pack with Wilma doing her best to keep pace with her. INT. JANE E. ELLIOTT CAFETERIA - DAY STUDENTS scramble about. SORORITY GIRLS wear pink sweaters and talk loudly at a table. Barbara eyes them longingly as she and Eleanor push their trays through the line. Then her eyes widen as she watches Billie loading up her tray.
E: CONT’D AKAs
C: BARBARA
D: Billie, aren't you scared of putting on weight?
C: BILLIE
D: Nah. All the practicing makes it slide right off. Just wait.
N: Billie inhales a big bite of cake. Barbara checks out the desserts. She chooses a few.
C: ELEANOR
D: I'd take Billie's advice with a grain of salt if I were you. She gets plenty of exercise outside of practice, if you know what I mean. She does. She reluctantly puts back only one of her desserts.
C: AT THE TABLE
D: Wilma scans the cafeteria and spies Billie, Barbara, and Eleanor. Intimidated, she walks towards them.
C: WILMA
D: Is it okay if I sit here?
C: BILLIE
D: It’s not a Woolworth’s lunch counter, so go on ‘head. There’s an awkward silence. Wilma breaks it.
E: aloofly gestures to sit
C: WILMA
D: I saw you in that Cadillac. Is that man your boyfriend?
C: BILLIE
D: Jimmy's lead sled caught your eye, huh? Naw, he's just a friend. I'm not really the ‘boyfriend’ type. A lot of girls come here to get their M.R.S. Degree. That’s not my style.
E: laughs
C: WILMA M.R.S. degree? BILLIE
D: You a real country gal, aren’t you? They're here to find themselves a husband, you know... a man who can keep ‘em spoiled like their daddy. Everyone instinctively looks at Barbara who doesn’t seem to notice. There’s another awkward beat. These four women may be teammates, but they have absolutely nothing in common.
E: then
C: ELEANOR
D: Alright ladies, so after dinner, you should get back to your rooms so you can get to bed. Practice is bright and early tomor--
C: BILLIE
D: --Ease up, Granny. Here I am still sweating from practice today and you're already talking about practice tomorrow.
C: WILMA
D: Is Coach Temple always this strict?
C: ELEANOR BILLIE
D: 
E: emphatic rolling her eyes
C: YES! YES! ELEANOR
D: So please don’t make a habit of breaking curfew like Billie.
C: BILLIE
D: Eleanor tells Coach everything.
C: ELEANOR
D: It’s my job.
C: BILLIE
D: Yeah, but you ain’t gotta like it so much.
C: BARBARA
D: Coach’s got more rules than with my mama and daddy.
C: WILMA
D: If his rules help me keep my scholarship, I’ll follow ‘em.
C: ELEANOR
D: What’s your major?
C: WILMA
D: Elementary education.
C: BARBARA
D: Hope you make teaching more exciting than this conversation. College is supposed to be fun.
C: WILMA
D: Running is fun.
C: ELEANOR
D: It has to be more than fun. It has to be your life. No distractions. Just school and track. Billie winks at a BOY staring at her from afar.
C: BILLIE
D: There’s always room for a little bit more. Eleanor purses her lips.
C: ELEANOR
D: Rhonda got ‘a little bit more’ last year and you see what that got her.
C: WILMA
D: Who’s Rhonda?
C: BILLIE
D: She ain’t nobody now.
C: WILMA
D: What happened to her?
C: BILLIE
D: She got knocked up and Coach threw her off the team. Shit. Fear washes over Wilma’s face.
C: BILLIE
D: He sent her packing right back to whatever country hill she came from. We ain’t seen her since.
E: CONT’D
C: BARBARA
D: He didn’t have to do all that.
C: ELEANOR
D: His track, his rules. No mothers on the field. Kids are the ultimate distraction. Barely breathing, Wilma forces a nod. Just then, Wendell walks in with confidence. He stands in the middle of the cafeteria and gives a distinctive ALPHA FRAT CALL with gusto.
C: WENDELL ROLL CALL! A-PHI-A!
D: A table full of ALPHA PHI ALPHA BROTHERS stand up. They’re smartly dressed in Frat regalia of the times: Button downs, trousers, oxfords, some wear bow ties.
C: ALPHA FRAT BROTHERS A-PHI-A!
D: A RIVAL FRAT GUY responds with another chant.
C: RIVAL FRAT GUY
D: PHI BE-TA SiiiIII-GMA!
C: WENDELL A-PHI-A! RIVAL FRAT GUY/SIGMA BROTHERS
D: Brothers! I said my brothers! /This house /Is full /Of blue and white/I said this house /Is full /Of Blue and White! In response, Wendell and the Alphas chant.
E: Yeah this house is full this house is full
C: WENDELL/ALPHA BROTHERS
D: A-Phi-A, A-Phi-A./The Phi Beta Sigmas got some soul!/A-Phi-A, A- Phi-A/But they just can't compare with the black and gold! They begin to STEP. The rhythm of their steps fills the cafeteria. Then the rival Sigma Frat jumps in to battle. Suddenly, AKA sorority start their signature ladylike moves. Not to be outdone, ZETA PHI BETA Sorority begins to battle. It's a magical moment. Our Tigerbelles watch in awe. Barbara, in particular, is intrigued. She catches the eye of Wendell. The STEPPING and CHANTS continue over: MONTAGE - THE FIRST WEEKS OF SCHOOL: INT. HALE HALL - WILMA’S ROOM - DAY An ALARM CLOCK goes off. Wilma groggily looks over at the other bed. Barbara’s asleep with an eye mask, pink rollers, and a scarf over her hair. Wilma quietly slides out of bed. INT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - CLASSROOM - DAY Wilma in Math class, studiously taking notes.
C: PROFESSOR
D: If you'll turn to page three of the reader that's being handed out... The STUDENT ahead of her, sporting a TSU FOOTBALL shirt, turns to hand her the readers. This is JESSE, 20. Wilma almost gasps at how good looking he is.
C: JESSE
D: Here you go. Wilma takes a reader and smiles shyly. Jesse can’t help but to take a look back over his shoulder. INT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - LIBRARY - DAY A stern LIBRARIAN walks Wilma through her campus job.
C: LIBRARIAN
D: To maintain your scholarship, you’ll work fifteen hours a week shelving books. The Librarian wheels out MOUNDS OF BOOKS. Wilma sighs.
C: WILMA
D: Yes, ma’am. EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - CAMPUS - DAY Wilma leaves the library, making her way across campus. She sees a group of NURSING STUDENTS pass by. Then, TWO THEATER STUDENTS recite Shakespeare. Wilma smiles to herself; being at college is a dream come true.
C: END MONTAGE
D: INT. HALE HALL - PHONE BOOTH - AFTERNOON Barbara’s already dressed in her practice gear. She’s propped up next to the dorm PHONE BOOTH. Wilma comes in the lobby.
C: BARBARA
D: There she is now. Wilma! It’s your boyfriend. Barbara sticks the phone in Wilma’s hand with a mischievous glint in her eye.
E: on the phone off phone
C: BARBARA
D: See you at practice. Don’t be late. Barbara hurries off. Wilma stares at the phone, torn. INTERCUT WITH: EXT. CLARKSVILLE STREETS - PHONE BOOTH - SAME TIME A FOR COLORED ONLY sign is firmly tacked to the phone booth. Robert toys with the cord, subtly clocking looks from the
E: CONT’D
C: WHITE BYSTANDERS passing by. WILMA
D: Robert? Robert brightens when he hears Wilma’s voice.
C: ROBERT
D: Hey, you.
C: WILMA
D: I’ve gotta go to practice. You give my mama the money?
C: ROBERT
D: Yeah, but she said she don’t want you sending no more. I swear that woman woulda cut me if it she ain’t have to answer to the Lord.
C: WILMA
D: Mama’s all bark.
C: ROBERT
D: She know how to bite too. Facts. Wilma chuckles.
C: ROBERT
D: I just got a quick question.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: Yeah?
C: ROBERT
D: What you got on right now?
C: WILMA
D: Robert! You crazy. I’m gonna be naked in a minute.
E: lowers her voice
C: ROBERT
D: Now that’s what I’m talking about.
C: WILMA
D: No, really. I gotta go change. I’ll try you later, okay?
C: ROBERT Alright, I--
D: She hangs up and takes off running. Robert’s left listening to the dull DIAL TONE, a little overlooked. EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - LATER It’s 5:58. Ed taps his watch suggestively as Wilma runs up, just in the nick of time. He blows his whistle.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Three lines, girls. Eleanor, run ‘em through the warm up. Eleanor leads them through exercises: high knees, butt kicks, lunges. Wilma and Barbara focus on each other, competing even in the warm-up. TIME CUT TO:
N: Wilma’s feet dig into the starting blocks. Sweat pours from her face. Barbara and Billie flank her on each side. BANG! They take off. Suddenly, Ed emphatically waves his arms and BLOWS his whistle bringing the Girls to a halt. Ed marches to Wilma and positions her back to the blocks.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You’re not doing a hard post on your take off. Wilma’s confused. She looks to Barbara and Billie. They don’t have a damn clue what he’s talking about either.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Get in your starting stance. Ed stands in front of her inspecting her heel-to-toe relationship. Her feet are shoulder width apart.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Now post up to me to assemble the hard post. Ed holds his arms out in front of Wilma, bracing for impact.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Run into my hands like you’re taking off. She does. His hands halt her shoulders mid-stride.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Hold the stance. One of Wilma’s legs stays up, holding her hard post position.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Feel your body in that line? That there’s a triple extension. You gotta hold that hard post. Your position needs to be perpendicular to the ground at a 90 degree angle. Eleanor takes copious notes. As Wilma strains to hold the position, her butt sticks out causing her stance to falter.
E: CONT’D to the Tigerbelles
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You’re broken at the waist. Breaking at the waist gives you what we call a bubble butt. You don’t want that.
E: CONT’D to the Tigerbelles
C: BILLIE
D: Mine ain’t never hurt me. Billie laughs and tries to give Eleanor a hand-slide, but Eleanor shushes her.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: This ain’t about body type, Billie. It’s about posture. Ed motions for Barbara to hold her hard post position. He nods his approval. Points to Billie. She nails it.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Always remember that if don’t get out of those blocks right, you cannot win. It doesn’t matter how fast you think you are. You’ll only end up being the fastest second place. Got it?
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: Yes, Coach.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: And you’re lopsided. Favoring one leg. It’s breaking your stride. Wilma lowers her gaze, feeling a little picked on.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Follow me. You have an injury you haven’t told me about?
E: CONT’D beat
C: WILMA
D: Nothing you don’t know about, sir. Wilma catches Barbara, Eleanor, and Billie watching.
C: WILMA
D: Just the polio when I was kid.
E: CONT’D low
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Well, it looks like you’re still carrying it. Come here. Ed digs around in his crate of EQUIPMENT. He pulls out an ANKLE WEIGHT and straps it onto Wilma’s left ankle. He snakes the strap around Wilma’s shoulder blades into a figure 8 and then loops it under her armpits. He tightens the strap and she immediately stands up straighter, but is self-conscious.
C: WILMA
D: My braces came off over 10 years ago. The doctors said I was good.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: And they did a good job teaching you to walk. But I’m gonna teach you to run. Until you straighten out, you’ll need to wear this 24-7. He motions for her to head back to the track. Wilma tightens her face to hide embarrassment. Eleanor takes notice of Wilma’s dismay with Ed’s solution.
C: WILMA
D: How’m I supposed to run in this?
C: ELEANOR
D: Trust me: Trust him. WHISTLE BLOWS! Wilma starts to run, clearly slowed by the contraption. Ed watches her in the back of the pack. INT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - GIRLS’ LOCKER ROOM - LATER Billie, Eleanor, and Barbara peel off her sweaty track attire. Wilma shleps in, the dispiritedness still present.
C: BARBARA
D: I can eat a whole poundcake by myself after today.
C: ELEANOR
D: Keep on and you really will have a bubble butt. In her underwear, Barbara monitors her svelte figure. Everything is taut and in place. Wilma turns away and tucks herself into a corner to hide her body. With her back to the Girls, she takes off her top. A C-SECTION SCAR is present on her stomach. She quickly slides on a shirt to hide it.
C: ELEANOR
D: Coach won’t hesitate to cut you if you get too big, Barbara. Wilma glances at her own image in the broken mirror.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: He has to know that life happens though, right? Folks can’t be perfect all the time.
C: BILLIE
D: Coach be wanting perfection like we Jesus walking on water... knowing damn well we all gonna drown.
C: BARBARA
D: My body weight is perfect. Barbara playfully shows off, giving dramatic face poses.
E: looking in the mirror
C: BILLIE
D: That’s cause all your weight is in that big head of yours. Swear it blows up more every damn day.
C: BARBARA
D: Being confident doesn’t mean you’re conceited. There’s a line.
C: BILLIE
D: You musta crossed that line long before you came here. Shit, I know Wilma is tortured on the daily living with you.
C: BARBARA
D: I’m not stuck up. No one nods in agreement. Billie turns to Wilma.
C: BILLIE
D: Am I right or am I wrong?
C: WILMA
D: I-I don’t know. BJ, I mean you can--
C: BARBARA
D: --Don’t let Billie get you into a discussion you can’t handle. Wilma goes quiet to keep the peace.
C: BILLIE
D: Wilma, you grown. Don’t let Barbara scare you. She all talk.
C: BARBARA
D: More like all beauty.
C: ELEANOR
D: Beauty doesn’t break the tape. If people have time to comment on how beautiful you are, then you’re not running fast enough.
C: BARBARA
D: What about you? You take down every word Coach says like it’s gospel and you still can’t outrun me.
E: offended
N: The gauntlet is thrown.
C: BILLIE
D: Oh, shit. To save face, Eleanor fires back.
C: ELEANOR
D: Billie, I bested you in the 400, so I wouldn’t get on a high horse. Half the time you do too much drinking to even climb one. Barbara chuckles causing Billie to one-up Eleanor.
C: BILLIE
D: Wilma got a late start and still got past you like you a crawling baby. I guess that stick up your ass must’ve slowed you down. Barbara sucks her teeth and scans Eleanor, reading her.
C: BARBARA
D: Age before beauty. Humph. Eleanor turns to Wilma who cuts her eyes to the ground. It’s best to be Switzerland. Stay neutral. Irritated, Eleanor grabs her things and heads for the door.
C: ELEANOR
D: We’ll see who’s crawling after Coach makes cuts. Icy, Billie and Barbara leave in opposite directions. Wilma takes a deep breath, alone without a team. INT. WILMA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY The Rudolph Family gathers around the kitchen table. Makeshift decorations adorn the kitchen coupled with a handwritten HAPPY BIRTHDAY SIGN. A group of LITTLE GIRLS dote over Yolanda. Wilma’s glued to the stack of school books crowding the kitchen table. She subconsciously fidgets with the brace contraption on her body. Robert slides a slice of untouched birthday cake closer to Wilma, but she doesn’t notice.
E: over her shoulder
C: CHARLENE
D: College done made you too good for my cake now? Don't be getting all uppity on us.
C: WILMA
D: I'm tryna lose weight. Coach Temple says we can't have sweets before a track meet.
C: ROBERT
D: Temple's Ten Commandments.
C: WILMA
D: Robert.
C: ROBERT
D: Way I see it, his rules should stay down at the campus. They shouldn’t be in your home life.
C: WILMA
D: I don’t get to punch out of being an athlete when practice ends. It don’t work like that.
C: ROBERT
D: You can’t punch out of your family either. You don’t even know how to make your own decisions. This stings.
C: WILMA
D: Just cause you don’t like my decisions, don’t mean I ain’t the one making ‘em.
C: CHARLENE
D: Alright, y’all cut out that bickering. We got presents to open. Yolanda GIGGLES as she holds onto the table, trying to take her first steps.
C: CHARLENE
D: Look at the birthday girl over there trying to strut.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: She standing up now?
C: ROBERT
D: Her first step can’t be far off.
C: WILMA
D: I guess Imma miss that too. Charlene saddles up next to Wilma trying to bring hope.
E: dejected
C: CHARLENE
D: Me and Yolanda gon’ come spend a weekend in the dorms with you. You can get in more time with her.
C: WILMA
D: So Barbara can tell Coach and get me kicked off the team? Naw.
C: CHARLENE
D: She won’t do that, Skeeter. She’s your teammate.
C: WILMA
D: She’s competition not a teammate. They all made that clear.
C: CHARLENE
D: That’s fear talking.
C: WILMA
D: No, that’s Barbara talking. She don’t miss a day telling me how she deserved the scholarship I got. Barbara can’t find out about Yolanda. None of ‘em can. Robert and Charlene turn to one another, unsure of how to soothe Wilma. Charlene pushes the cake closer to Wilma.
E: beat
C: CHARLENE
D: One bite can’t hurt. I promise I won’t tell. Charlene looks for backup from Robert, who looks on, almost testing. Wilma sits there longingly looking at her cake. She takes a big bite, closing her eyes in satisfaction. Robert kisses her gently on the cheek as an apology. EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - DAY The Tigerbelles gather with noticeably fewer girls in attendance. Ed beckons them closer.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Our meet is in two weeks. It’s our only meet this season. ‘Til now, the girls that couldn’t cut it have been taking themselves out. But today is the day I skim the cream. Proven correct, Eleanor self-righteously raises her brows to Billie, Barbara, and Wilma. Wilma stiffly stands wearing the brace contraption, hoping this is all worth it. The Tigerbelles all look at one another. Who’s it gonna be?
N: MONTAGE - SKIMMING THE PACK: Ed BLOWS the whistle and the Girls run. He takes notes. As Eleanor takes off with urgency...
C: A CLUNKY RUNNER
D: ...takes to the track, but her stride has no cadence and she weaves in between the lines. Ed motions for her to leave the track. Saddened, she does. Ed lines the Girls up for another run. Barbara digs deep as she hustles around the track.
C: A STIFF RUNNER
D: ...makes the turn on the track with her upper body rigid. Ed blows the whistle and points for her to leave. Down goes another runner. The Girls line up for another run. Billie passes the others with ease, looking like a winner.
C: A HEEL-HIKER
D: ...can’t avoid over-striding. It makes her foot land too far in front of her knee. Ed adjust his glasses. He waves his hand for her to stop running. She let’s the tears flow. EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - LATER Another run. Wilma’s fingers press into the track, awaiting Ed’s whistle. Ed BLOWS it and they’re off. He immediately notices Wilma’s posture is off.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Damnit. Just listen. This faux-pas puts Billie in the lead. Barbara and Eleanor are close behind. Wilma kicks into another gear to catch up. Ed zeros in her, and only her. -- WILMA’S LEGS running, her FEET STRIKING the track. -- Ed is one with his STOPWATCH. His eyes widens as he looks between his stopwatch and Wilma. -- Wilma breathes rhythmically, running in stride. She passes Eleanor and closes in on Barbara with cheetah like speed. -- Ed stops staring at the stopwatch. Seeing something special, the whistle drops from his mouth. -- WILMA’S ARMS PUMPING. Her face suddenly contorts into a strained look. She’s flies by Barbara.
E: mumbling to himself
N: Billie crosses the finish line with Wilma only inches behind her. Wilma almost caught up, but failed. Ed shakes his head in frustration.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Best second place! Wilma’s frustrated with herself as Ed addresses the Girls.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: If you’re still on this field, make sure you’re ready to run at the Tuskegee meet. The remaining Girls on the track congratulate each other.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Miss Rudolph, come to my office. INT. TSU - COACH TEMPLE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER Ed’s makeshift office is nothing more than a desk in the middle of an equipment storage shed. Wilma follows Ed.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: Sir, I know what you’re gonna say. I was awful out there.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Your biggest mistake today was that you thought you knew better than me. I already told you. Bad posture cannot win. Wilma tugs at the brace.
C: WILMA
D: I woulda caught Billie if I ain’t have this on. It slows me down. This thing makes me feel like I’m a dang cripple.
E: finally
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: It’s your broken spirit that’s slowing you down. Your past doesn’t have to be a cinderblock. It doesn’t have to define you. You need to work to move past it. Did you know you were on pace for a record-setting run with the brace? Her surprised look portrays a resounding no.
E: beat
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: And I think if you would’ve held your hard post, you would’ve taken it. You have something really special. Something only a few runners in a lifetime possess. I can help you uncover it, but you need to listen. To trust me. And you must make Tigerbelles your priority. You’re running anchor at the Tuskegee meet.
E: CONT’D beat
C: WILMA
D: Really?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Now go on, Skeeter. Get showered. e Wilma’s thrown off. Did he just call her “Skeeter?”
C: WILMA
D: You never called me that before.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You weren’t officially my runner before. Now don’t think this means you get to call me ‘Ed’ though. Go change out. INT. TSU - JUST OUTSIDE COACH TEMPLE'S OFFICE - SAME TIME Wilma scans the area, she’s alone. She pumps her fist in the air and lets out a SHRIEK of joy. INT. TSU - COACH TEMPLE’S OFFICE - SAME TIME Ed can’t help but to smile as the excited SOUNDS of WILMA’S SHRIEKING comes into his office. As the sounds die out, Ed’s eyes fall on an OLD BOX sitting behind his desk. His worried look shows that this box haunts him. He slowly approaches the box. He exhales as he opens it. It’s full of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, MEDAL RIBBONS, and OLD RACE NUMBER RUNNING BIBS. He rifles through each item. INSERT: A headline reads: MARVIN JOHNSON, TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY TRACK AND FOOTBALL STAR SWEEPS HBCU NATIONALS. Ed scans the write up. INSERT: ED’S NAME is toward the bottom. He’s listed as an ALSO RAN. The PHOTO shows Marvin Johnson crossing the finish line with Ed far off in the background, forgotten. Ed slams the box shut, unsettled by those memories.
E: beat
S: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - LATER
N: Ed walks toward the infield where COACH MARVIN JOHNSON, 38, YELLS from the sidelines at the FOOTBALL TEAM. Dressed in his pristine TSU sweatsuit, it’s clear his BMOC (Big Man on Campus) status never died. But Ed has his gaze and step locked in on the man chit chatting with Marvin Johnson... Tennessee State University’s President, WALTER DAVIS, 60. Just as Ed is about to speak to Davis... CLACK!!! Both Ed and Davis’ attention is drawn to the clashing of shoulder pads from the massive HIT on the field. Jesse (Wilma’s classmate) has made the impressive tackle. Marvin proudly looks on.
C: MARVIN
D: Know you not used to it, but that’s the sound of winning, Temple. He nudges Ed in fun and belts out an annoying laugh. Jesus, Ed can’t stand this guy and we can see why. He tries to be the bigger man.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Team’s looking good, Marvin.
C: MARVIN
D: I think this is our year. Ed moves closer to Walter.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Walter, a word? Davis tries to contain his irritation. Ed has a history of pestering him. They move away from Marvin.
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: Sure, Ed. What is it?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Well, you know I’m taking the Tigerbelles to the HBCU national meet next week.
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: Yes, I’m sure that’ll be, uh, very exciting time.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: It will once we win it. I’m hoping that success will help you consider me for something more prominent with the university.
E: beat
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: And what would that prominence be?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: The men’s track coach position.
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: Marvin’s already our men’s coach.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I know, but Marvin’s never brought you a title. I can do that with these girls. Ed has Davis’ ear; he adds to his pitch.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: And when I do, it’s worth thinking about a restructure. If I could get my hands on the men’s team, I could really make a mark for the school. Davis considers it and dangles a carrot.
E: CONT’D
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: Let’s see what you can do in Tuskegee first and then we’ll talk. Ed nods. A potential victory on its way. EXT. OUTSIDE NASHVILLE / INT. ROBERT’S PICKUP TRUCK - MORNING The early morning light kisses the horizon. Charlene holds Yolanda in her arms. She and Wilma are squeezed together as Robert drives to campus. Wilma anxiously taps her feet.
C: WILMA
D: Is this as fast as you can go?
C: ROBERT
D: Just a few more miles, Skeeter. I’ll get you there in time.
C: WILMA
D: Coach is gonna be mad. This is the most important day of our season. If I don’t get this right, nothing else matters. Robert abruptly HITS his brakes. Traffic has backed up ahead of them. Robert cranes his heads out his window to see what’s going on. POLICE LIGHTS FLASH ahead.
C: CHARLENE
D: What’s going on?
C: ROBERT
D: Looks like a hog truck overturned.
C: WILMA I can’t wait. CHARLENE
D: You gon’ have to. Like hell. Wilma’s grabs her overnight bag. She gives Yolanda a very quick kiss and leaps out.
C: CHARLENE
D: Hold on! Wilma doesn’t even look back to see Yolanda reaching out for her. Charlene lets out a heavy laden sigh. EXT. ROAD - SAME TIME The campus of Tennessee State University sits in the distance. Wilma runs through the HOGS and TRAFFIC towards it. EXT. HALE HALL - SAME TIME Ed and the Tigerbelles wait in a van. All of the RUNNERS are there, except for one. Billie slumps in her seat wearing sunglasses. Very hung over.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Where's Skeeter? I told my sister- in-law we’d be there before it gets dark. We need to be on the road in ten minutes! Frowning, Billie slightly lowers her sunglasses.
C: BILLIE
D: Well, yelling ain’t gonna make her up and appear.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I’ve told y’all a thousand times if you're not early, you're late. I... As Ed continues to rant, WILMA DARTS into the van.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Where in God’s tarnation have you--
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: --The roads got blocked. I had to run the rest of the way.
N: Eager, Barbara nudges Billie, waiting on Ed to erupt. Their eyes dart between the two, anticipating. Ed takes in Wilma profusely sweating and still winded.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Well... alright. Let’s go. Get here ahead of time in the future. No more of this fastest second place, you hear?
C: WILMA
D: Yes, sir.
N: Slightly pissed, Barbara mouths, “What the hell?” to Billie as Ed slams the van door shut.
S: EXT. TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - DAY
N: A BANNER reads: 1958 HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TRACK MEET. Our Tigerbelles arrive, turning the heads of their opponents. They’re definitely in the “foxes” category. Barbara stops walking, looking unimpressed.
C: BARBARA
D: There's no bleachers. Where are my fans supposed to sit?
C: BILLIE
D: Fans? Girl, please. You better be glad we get a damn baton. HONKS blare out. Barbara's Parents jump out of their Lincoln with Family and Friends. Their SIGNS and fervent waves feign celebrity status. She beams, playing the part. Barbara throws an “I told you so” look to Billie.
C: CHARLENE
D: Skeeter! Wilma turns to see her entire Family has also made the trip. Robert uses Yolanda’s little hand to wave at Wilma.
E: O.S.
C: BILLIE
D: Look who gotta a man with a built in family.
C: WILMA
D: Robert’s a play uncle. That’s my sister’s baby.
C: BILLIE
D: As fine as he is, you better make sure you ain’t next.
N: Billie looks to Eleanor for backup, but she’s wandered off to a STOIC and PROPER COUPLE. They give a tight and polite wave to Eleanor. These devout church goers are Eleanor’s parents.
C: WILMA
D: I’ll be back for warmups. As Wilma runs over to her family, Billie can’t help but to notice she has no family in attendance. Her eyes dart from Barbara, to Eleanor, and finally to Wilma. All surrounded by their blood. Billie quickly refocuses her attention the ALABAMA STATE TRACK ASSISTANT COACH who’s smiling at her. Billie switches toward the young coach. Meanwhile, Wilma gathers with her family.
C: WILMA
D: What y’all doing here? Charlene points to Barbara’s Family fawning over Barbara doing her best poses. They’re celebrating absolutely nothing.
E: CONT’D
C: CHARLENE
D: That... but much better.
C: WILMA
D: Mama, you supposed to be at work.
C: BLANCHE
D: I told Mrs. Roberts I’d come in tomorrow. Wasn’t no way I was missing my college girl’s big day! Wilma takes in her Family staring at her... expectations high. She takes a deep breath. Ed spots President Davis in the CROWD making small talk. Ed gets serious, feeling stakes of his own. MONTAGE - TUSKEGEE TRACK MEET: ATHLETES from Tuskegee University, Alabama State, Prairie View A&M, and Florida A&M mill about. -- Line up for the 100. Wilma and Barbara get in the blocks. Wilma fidgets. The RUNNER next to her gives a tough gaze.
C: TUSKEGEE RUNNER
D: Shoulda spent more time training and less on your hair. The GUN FIRES! Wilma wins easily. Barbara struggles for SECOND PLACE. She looks to her family, downcast. -- Line up for the 200: Barbara, Billie, and Wilma walk to their lanes and shake out their muscles. Eleanor looks at the Tigerbelles and then at Ed. He’s glowering.
C: ELEANOR
D: Girls, get set! Run strong! This is our race! The Starter FIRES his pistol. Wilma’s got a bubble butt.
E: clapping
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: No bubble, Skeeter! Longer strides, Billie! Barbara, focus! Eleanor, pick it up! -- The race ends with Billie placing first, Wilma second, and Barbara narrowly securing third. Eleanor closes in fourth. Ed glances up at President Davis, who claps, very pleased. -- The 4x100 relay: The Tigerbelles huddle.
C: ELEANOR
D: Okay, the Tuskegee lead off is fast off the blocks, so nail the first twenty steps. If she only does fifteen--
C: BARBARA
D: --Lord, everything’s not a math lesson. Hell, just run.
C: ELEANOR
D: There’s a method for a reason. Now, Billie, if--
C: BILLIE
D: --I got this, Old Lady. The team disbands to take their places around the track. Billie lines up next to the Tuskegee Runner who was throwing shade in warm-ups.
C: BILLIE
D: Let’s see what your hair looks like when I whoop your ass. BANG! Billie takes off with spring in her step and passes the baton to Eleanor. Eleanor runs hard then passes perfectly to Barbara. Barbara catches her Family CHEERING from the corner of her eye and turns on the gas. The handoff with Barbara and Wilma is not clean! Ed cringes at this error, but Wilma easily cruises with her long strides. She takes FIRST PLACE!
E: CONT’D
C: BILLIE
D: That's how it’s done! Everybody better get hep! Each of the Tigerbelles celebrate separately with their families and clicks. To his dismay, Ed witnesses this. President Davis CLAPS with fervor and beckons Ed over.
E: CONT’D
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: Strong end to your season, Ed.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Thank you. So, does that mean...?
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: Like I said, Marvin’s already our men’s coach. I’m not in the habit of fixing things that aren’t broken. Again, good job today. Davis walks off leaving Ed angsty. He turns to see Billie doing a victory dance as the Girls finally reconvene to celebrate together. They boast loudly around Billie.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Billie! Billie stops. The other Girls quiet down. The smiles drain from their faces.
E: angrily, sternly
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: That was not a performance to celebrate. Not from any of you. Your times were off.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: But Coach, we won--
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: --You beat the competition, but you did not win. Winners challenge themselves. Winners give their best performance. Can any of you say you did that today? There’s some truth in his words no matter how harsh.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Today wasn’t good enough. It’s not something to be proud of.
E: CONT’D
C: BILLIE
D: Congratulations to you too. Her sarcasm wasn’t quiet low enough because Ed spins back.
E: under her breath
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Get back on the track!
C: BARBARA BILLIE
D: We don't even have any more You gotta be kidding me. meets this season.
C: ELEANOR
D: Really, sir? Is this necessary? Undeterred, Ed points at the track. In disbelief, they obey. The FANS suddenly stop their chatter. The other TEAMS whisper to one another. Barbara, Eleanor, and Wilma look at their Families... each family gut-wrenched. Humiliated and with shame on their faces, the Tigerbelles start to run. EXT. MAISIE’S HOME - NIGHT A small, neat home belonging to Ed’s sister-in-law, Maisie. INT. MAISIE’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor have made beds on the couch and pallets on the floor with a variety of mismatched pillows and blankets. Eleanor pores over a SPORTS ILLUSTRATED MAGAZINE and studiously jots down notes. LEGGY FEMALE ATHLETES are on the cover. Billie notes this.
C: BILLIE
D: Burning the midnight oil on your studies, huh? Anatomy lesson? Eleanor ignores her and continues reading.
C: BARBARA
D: I cannot believe he made us do punishment laps in front of everybody. I’m not down with this shaming folks stuff.
C: BILLIE
D: He tells us to be foxes, but he treats us like dogs.
C: ELEANOR
D: Coach has his reasons.
C: BILLIE
D: Eleanor, do you ever think anything he does is wrong? Did you see him turn water into wine? Cause if he did do that, he sho’ forgot to share it with us.
C: ELEANOR
D: I believe you had your share of ‘water’ last night.
C: BARBARA
D: Well, I’m not gonna let Coach Killjoy keep me from celebrating.
N: Barbara pulls out a hat box and gently removes the lid to reveal... a perfectly baked PIE. All of their eyes bulge.
C: BARBARA
D: Mama and Daddy brought it for me.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: You mean for us?
E: smiles playfully
N: The Girls dig in, inhaling each bite with pure exultation. Wilma lets out a joyful moan.
C: BILLIE
D: Don’t you need to save them sounds for Robert?
N: Wilma gasps and Eleanor metaphorically clutches her pearls. Barbara doubles over laughing.
C: BARBARA
D: You wrong for that, Billie.
C: BILLIE
D: Truth ain’t never hurt nobody. Ain’t he’s Skeeter’s boyfriend?
C: ELEANOR
D: And future husband I take it?
C: BILLIE
D: Stop rushing folks to the alter. Why somebody would wanna be locked down and married at this age is beyond me.
C: WILMA
D: I love Robert. I’ve loved him since we were lil’ bitty kids.
N: Barbara takes another bite, all ears.
C: WILMA
D: He was my best friend. Truth was he was my only friend back then. He stuck up for me when other kids used to pick on me. But I don’t think I’m ready to be his wife. Not just yet.
E: CONT'D beat
C: BILLIE
D: Good! You got a whole lifetime to be some man’s wife, but you only got this lil’ time now to be yourself.
N: Wilma takes in Billie’s words.
C: BILLIE
D: Explore your options... cause I’m sure as hell gonna explore mine.
E: CONT’D
N: The Girls laugh and give each other hand-slides.
S: INT. MAISIE’S HOME - DEN - SAME TIME
N: Ed holds the rotary phone in his hand as he cradles the handset. MAISIE, 30, gestures toward the phone with a wave.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: ...Your sister says hello. INTERCUT WITH: INT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME C.B., in a pretty nightgown, finishes wrapping her hair in a satin scarf.
E: on the phone
C: C.B.
D: Tell Maisie I miss her.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: C.B. sends her love. And Maisie, thanks again for letting me and my team sleep here.
E: to Maisie
C: MAISIE
D: After what they did out there today, it’s all my pleasure, Ed. Have a good night. C.B. motions to The Temple children walking down the hallway. EDWINA, 6, and LLOYD, 4, come in and kiss her goodnight. She holds the phone toward them.
C: C.B.
D: It’s your Daddy.
C: EDWINA LLOYD
D: Hey, Daddy!!! I miss you! Daddy!!! When are coming home?! A moment of relief graces Ed’s face.
C: COACH TEMPLE I miss y’all too. C.B.
D: They will be all yours come tomorrow evening.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I’ll be there. We should be back no later than noon. You nervous about your meeting?
E: beat
C: C.B.
D: I’m fine. It’s the men of the church who get nervous every time a woman takes the lead on anything.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You do know how to strike fear. She laughs. He somehow knows just how to make her do that.
C: C.B.
D: Long as you know to stay in line.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Always, baby. Edwina and Lloyd start playing around. Time to shut it down.
C: C.B.
D: Say ‘Goodnight.’
E: to the Kids
C: EDWINA LLOYD
D: Goodnight! Love you, Daddy! Goodnight! Love you!
C: C.B.
D: Now go on and get to bed. Love you. C.B. makes sure Edwina and Lloyd have gone down the hallway. Their door SLAMS. C.B. leans into the phone listening to the silence on the other end.
C: C.B.
D: You gonna talk or just hold the weight of the world? She knows him. Ed shifts his weight as he leans against the wall. His mind is heavy.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Walter won’t give me a chance. Marvin’s boys aren’t up to snuff. They can’t even outrun my girls.
C: C.B.
D: See the good, baby. Y’all came in first place... in every event, Ed. I don't know how you can do better than that.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: By getting the job, C.B. The TIGERBELLES’ LAUGHTER wafts into the room. Ed, still irritated, furrows his brow.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Hold it down in there! INT. MAISIE’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME The Girls hear Ed and softly GIGGLE with the forks firmly in their hands.
E: CONT’D shouting out the door
C: BILLIE
D: Oh, I’m gonna hold it down alright. She digs into the pie. The Girls quietly laugh as they follow suit, eating right out of the tin. Eleanor slips out the room. RESUME - ED AND C.B. PHONE CONVERSATION - SAME TIME
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: And it's not about coming in first. Eleanor listens on the other side of the door.
C: C.B.
D: What’s it about then?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: The girls’ effort. They only get one meet a season. They need to leave it all out there on the track. They’re doing this apart, not together. It’s not good enough. Eleanor takes this in.
C: C.B.
D: It wasn’t good enough for what? You can’t take your dreams out on everyone else. There’s a KNOCK on the door closest to Ed.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I’ve got to go now. I love you. He hangs up the phone and steps out into the hallway to find Eleanor standing there.
E: into phone
C: ELEANOR
D: Coach, I’m sorry for interrupting, but I think you need to see this. She shows him the SPORTS ILLUSTRATED MAGAZINE. INSERT: ELEANOR’S HANDWRITTEN NOTES are on the page.
C: TIGERBELLES RUNNERS NAMES appear.
D: Ed studies the page, then locks eyes with Eleanor. Knowing. She gives a subtle smile. He nods, optimistic... Whatever he has just read is a game changer. INT. COACH TEMPLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Ed lugs his bags from Tuskegee inside. Then, he spots his portly mother-in-law, MAMA GRACE, 60, on the couch crocheting. She delivers a judgmental glance over the top of her glasses as he walks in the door.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Oh! Hi, Mama Grace. I wasn't expecting you here. Where's C.B.?
C: MAMA GRACE
D: She had her literacy program meeting at the church. She waited and waited on you, and then had to call me to watch the kids. Shit, he forgot. Mama Grace seems to take some joy from this. HEADLIGHTS shine through the window as the sound of TIRES on GRAVEL invade the house. C.B. comes in the front door. She looks at Ed, visibly annoyed.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: C.B., I'm sorry, sweetie. I tried to make it back in time, but I had some moves to make and fast. Eleanor showed me something that--
C: C.B.
D: --That could’ve waited. You know I have commitments and responsibilities too.
C: MAMA GRACE
D: To the Lord! Both C.B. and Ed throw Mama Grace a glance.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Mama Grace, let me drive you home.
C: MAMA GRACE
D: At this time of night? What would my neighbors think? Oh, no. I'm spending the night tonight. C.B. and Ed turn to one another... not exactly their choice. INT. COACH TEMPLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT The bedroom is well-kept with his and hers beds. It’s functionally decorated with practical mid-century decor. Ed walks in and looks at C.B. in bed, reading a CHURCH PAMPHLET
C: about her LITERACY PROGRAM. COACH TEMPLE
D: Good you’re still awake. Something I need to show you. He pulls out the Sports Illustrated Magazine. A WHITE TRACK TEAM from Texas is on the cover. C.B. raises a brow.
C: C.B.
D: Women runners on the cover? That's good for you. For next year at least.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Look at page eighteen. She turns the page and now we REVEAL... INSERT: CHART OF RUNNING TIMES. The Tigerbelles’ TIMES are written on it by Eleanor for comparison.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: They got the cover with those times. Their time in the one hundred is point five below our slowest runner. Point seven in the two hundred. C.B. closely examines the page.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: And look at the relay. These Texas girls aren’t the best runners in country. My girls are. He swallows hard, but is certain.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: The National meet is in six weeks. In New York.
E: CONT’D
N: C.B. shakes her head, knowing what this means.
C: C.B.
D: National meet, not a Colored meet.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: That’s why I stayed behind in Tuskegee. He settles on the bed next to C.B.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I need to put ‘em up against a whole set of runners they don’t know. Both men and women.
E: CONT’D
C: C.B.
D: But your speed is your speed, isn’t it? Doesn’t matter who’s running.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Beating each other at practice only gets them so far. I gotta bring ‘em
C: together, C.B.
D: To beat them white girls, they need an ‘us against the world’ mentality. And they can’t be an ‘us’ if they’re focused on ‘I.’ C.B. nods in agreement as she sits up in bed.
E: beat
C: C.B.
D: Is President Davis on board with this plan of bringing in other runners? You think he’s gonna let the girls run up against grown men? His silence is a resounding no, but to clarify:
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: High school boys, not men.
C: C.B.
D: How are you gonna creep around and do this without getting caught?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: There’ll be hurdles, but I can clear them. Baby, if we win in New York there’s no way Walter can keep snubbing me. It’ll be the first for the school. Hell, the first for any Black college. C.B.’s eyes move to the literacy pamphlet, then back to him.
C: C.B.
D: Six more weeks of training and fundraising... I’ve got my own work to do, Ed.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I’ll make it up to you. She purses her lips.
C: C.B.
D: Oh, so you want my mama to keep showing up at the house, I see. He chuckles.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Not one bit. I can’t do this. He cuddles up to her and kisses her neck.
C: C.B.
D: Mama’s in the other room.
E: giggling, whispering
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Then you best be quiet. The two whisper and make love. EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - EVENING Wilma trains alone on the track. Determined, she’s wearing the brace Ed gave her. Jesse and his TEAMMATES pack up their gear at the end of football practice. Jesse lingers behind his Teammates to watch Wilma run. She's natural and beautiful. He walks toward her and she slows down to a trot.
C: JESSE
D: Your stride’s looking good.
C: WILMA
D: Coach swears this thing is helping,
C: but I don’t know.
D: She fidgets with the brace, embarrassed. Jesse notices.
C: JESSE
D: It’s just another piece of equipment. No different from my helmet or shoulder pads. She nods, grateful for his kind words.
C: JESSE
D: I'm excited to see what y’all pull out in New York. I can't wait.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: What you talking ‘bout?
C: JESSE
D: Coach asked me to help drive y’all up there. Wilma tries not to look excited about the news.
C: JESSE
D: I thought he was done with me after the other night, but he wants to pay me to go. But I won’t take it.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: Boy, you crazy. You coulda loaned me the money.
C: JESSE
D: What I’m about to witness you doing on that track is priceless. Why take anything less? Wilma cuts her eyes to the ground.
C: WILMA
D: I’m kinda nervous.
E: exhales
C: JESSE
D: You're as good as any runner I've ever seen. Girl, you are fast. A smile comes to her face.
C: JESSE
D: But you could work on your head games, though. Huh? Her smile falls.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: Head games?
C: JESSE
D: Sports aren't just physical. You've gotta get your mental game together. Get into your opponent’s head before the race even starts. Lemme see you in the blocks. Wilma walks over to the blocks and directly settles in.
C: JESSE
D: I'm not afraid of that.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: What?
C: JESSE
D: That’s not gonna cut it. I'm not second guessing myself. Look here, watch me. Jesse gets into the blocks next to her.
C: JESSE
D: Get close. Take up space. He's close to her, intimate. Their bodies just inches away.
E: CONT’D
C: JESSE
D: If you stretch, make it wide. If you jump, make it high. Don't look at nobody, but make sure everyone can see you. Be a blind peacock.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA A blind peacock? JESSE
D: Beautiful and don’t even know it. They steal a glance at each other. Both liking what they see. Wilma’s breaks eye contact and Jesse picks up on it... the intimacy’s too much. He switches gears.
E: nods
C: JESSE
D: Runners on your marks. And... Go! They take off running together, playfully racing, laughing. CUT TO: MONTAGE - 4 WEEKS UNTIL NEW YORK: -- Barbara slides through COUPLES slow grinding on the dance floor at the ALPHA’s frat house. Wendell rolls a cigarette during a spades game. He sees Barbara and jumps up. Wendell happily leads her into the party. -- The life of her own party, Billie’s at a JUKE JOINT grinding and throwing back drinks. -- Wilma shakes Yolanda’s bottle while skimming the graded test in her hand. She got a C. Yolanda squirms in her arms. She holds the poor test in her mouth during feeding. -- Late, Eleanor’s in bed looking over her track notes. She hears LAUGHTER outside. She peeks out of her window to see GROUPS of GIRLS having fun. She closes her shade.
E: CONT’D
N: -- Wilma counts out a tiny stack of CASH. She stuffs all but $3 in an ENVELOPE addressed to her MOTHER. -- Wilma and Barbara come to the dorm late from practice. Stomach growling, Wilma looks at the clock. It's 10 P.M. She turns to her pile of books, sighs and sits down to start studying. -- Ed adjusts the brace on Wilma’s body. She winces as it digs further into her skin. -- Exhausted, Wilma prepares an ice bath. She SCREAMS when she plunges into the freezing water. -- The Tigerbelles run hard. Energy wavers. Ed YELLS from the sidelines.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Push! -- Ed monitors Billie and Barbara as they struggle doing push- ups and crunches. -- Morning sun comes through the window to find Billie’s in bed still dressed from her night on the town. She snores drunkenly. INT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT The family is having a sit-down dinner. C.B. exhales as Ed talks animatedly.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: The girls aren’t giving me their all at practice. They’re not focused.
C: C.B.
D: Well, all I know is that I’m happy to have us all eating together for a change. How was your day at school, Edwina? Before Edwina can answer, Ed keeps on talking.
E: then
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: They’re just coasting on their raw talent. But everyone at this AAU meet is gonna have the same kind of raw talent. We’re gonna be the first all-Black team at this event. All eyes will be on us. C.B. sighs. She’s not going to win this battle.
C: C.B.
D: They know that. No Negro who has the potential to be ‘first’ at something doesn’t realize those stakes. But, Ed, these girls aren’t professional athletes. They’re college students. Beyond all of your practices, they’ve got the early morning classes, the late night studying...
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: ...the parties, the extracurriculars, the boys. A light bulb goes off. He suddenly grabs his jacket.
C: EDWINA
D: Daddy, where are you going?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I’ll be back.
C: C.B.
D: Ed?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Y’all get to bed on time, you hear? C.B. grits her teeth as the door SLAMS behind him. EXT. HALE HALL / INT. COACH TEMPLE'S STATION WAGON - LATER Ed stakes out in his station wagon across from the dorm. All is peaceful and quiet. He yawns and checks his watch. Suddenly, a PACK OF SORORITY PLEDGES wearing dunce caps exit the AKA SORORITY HOUSE across the way. The AKAs, dressed in pink and green, bark orders at the Pledges as they do army crawls in the dirt. Ed puts his glasses on to take a better look. Amongst the group, he sees BARBARA! They finish the drill and disperse. Barbara’s worn-out as she stumbles to the dorm.
E: to Edwina and Lloyd
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Pledging... As Ed shakes his head in disappointment, a shiny CADILLAC squeals up to the dorm curb. Out climbs BILLIE! Aghast, Ed FLASHES his headlights and HONKS. Billie, startled, squints to see who’s honking. She recognizes Coach Temple’s car.
E: mumbling to himself
C: BILLIE
D: Shit. She makes a run for it and heads directly to the dorm.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You running faster now than you do in practice. INT. HALE HALL - HALLWAY - SAME TIME Billie comes thundering down the hall. Barbara pops her head out her door.
E: to himself
C: BARBARA
D: What’s wrong? Someone chasing you? In pajamas and an old housecoat, Eleanor pokes her head out her door.
C: ELEANOR
D: What’s all this commotion about?
C: BILLIE
D: Coach is outside! He caught me sneaking in! They bolt to the window and peer down on Coach Temple’s car.
C: BACK OUTSIDE
D: Wilma and Jesse carry to a stack of books as they head for the dorms.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Not Skeeter too. These girls take me for a damn fool! Not tonight! Ed speeds his car toward Wilma and Jesse. She’s a deer in his headlights.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: What’s going on here? Curfew was two hours ago!
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: Coach... I'm sorry... I... I just--
C: JESSE
D: Coach, Skeeter wasn’t--
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: --I don't need any explanation from you, son. This is between me and my runner.
N: Wilma takes a deep breath. This is gonna be difficult.
C: WILMA
D: I’m failing math. School comes before running, right? Ed can’t argue with his own rules.
C: WILMA
D: Jesse’s helping me study. He can’t come in the dorms and the library just closed. Even though they can’t hear the conversation, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor watch the drama unfold FROM THE DORM WINDOW. They might as well have popcorn.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: That’s why I missed curfew. Am I off the team? Jesse waits with baited breath.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Goodnight, Jesse. Cue noted. Jesse carefully places several more books into Wilma’s arms before leaving. FROM THE DORM WINDOW: Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor stay focused on Ed and Wilma. He’s very animated. They turn to one another with a knowing look... this can’t be good. EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - DAY Ed BLOWS THE WHISTLE to end practice. The Tigerbelles are sweat-soaked and worn.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Not sure what happened, but y’all really pushed yourselves today. Good job. Barbara and Billie exchange a glance as they all pack up.
C: BARBARA
D: He didn’t say nothing.
E: whispers
C: BILLIE
D: I’m not gonna stick around to see that change. They pack faster and begin to leave the field with Wilma and Eleanor.
E: whispers
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Barbara? Billie? Shit. Barbara and Billie both stop in their tracks. Wilma and Eleanor slow their pace, listening from a distance.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Since you both like to be running all around town after curfew, maybe you’ll like running a few more laps around the track. Fifteen laps. Eleanor, stay and keep their tally. Make sure they aren’t cutting corners.
E: CONT’D then
C: BARBARA
D: What about Skeeter? She was out past curfew too last night too.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: That’s another eight laps for not minding your own business. Billie starts to protest, but Ed BLOWS his WHISTLE.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Get to work. EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - NIGHT Wilma, Billie, Barbara, and Eleanor, all in their Tigerbelles uniforms, walk toward a handful of CARS illuminating the track with headlights. Barbara pulls at her uniform.
E: CONT’D
C: BARBARA
D: What kinda practice is this?
C: BILLIE
D: A mess. Probably a weigh-in to make sure we ain’t got too big.
C: WILMA
D: You sure about this, Eleanor?
C: ELEANOR
D: Coach said be here at 9. Billie scans the darkened area. She can’t see if anyone is in the cars.
C: BILLIE
D: Sending Black folks into a dark field can’t ever end well.
N: As the Tigerbelles emerge closer to the track, a CAR DOOR OPENS. They hesitate until they see Ed get out of his car, with his whistle, stopwatch, and clipboard in hand.
C: BARBARA
D: What’s going on?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Your next meet. Suddenly, PEOPLE emerge from the other cars. FOUR HIGH SCHOOL BOYS, Black 14, and 4 HBCU ALUMNI WOMEN TRACK TEAM, Black 25.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Your competition. Wilma, Eleanor, Barbara, and Billie take in the teams. Billie puts her hand on her hip.
E: CONT’D
C: BILLIE
D: Now I don’t mean no harm, but what makes you think some boys who can’t grow a beard and some old women who probably growing beards, can compete with us? Barbara stifles her laughter. Wilma and Eleanor half-grin.
C: BARBARA
D: Coach, I don’t want to question your methods--
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: --But you can’t help yourself. Go
C: ahead, BJ. BARBARA
D: We’re faster. This is a waste.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: The Texas girls get fifteen races a season. Y’all get one. Practice is never as good as the real deal.
C: ELEANOR
D: I guess a dress rehearsal couldn’t hurt us. A string of ‘Whatever’ shrugs and unenthusiastic nods pepper Wilma, Billie, and Barbara’s faces. Ed hands them their BIBS.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: We’re doing everything by regulation like a real meet. As real I can make it anyway.
N: The Girls see Ed has accumulated some REFEREES. Jesse puts the final touches on the FRESH LANE LINES. Wendell holds FINISH LINE ROLLS. Ed’s called all hands on deck. Billie puts on her bib and starts for the track.
C: BILLIE
D: Let’s go ‘head and beat these folks so I can go to bed. CUT TO: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - LATER 4x200: Winded, Billie PANTS as she runs full speed at the TURN. Her head slightly turns to either side. She’s actually being matched by the HIGH SCHOOL RUNNER and the HBCU RUNNER! Billie is shocked as hell. Ed watches, astounded. Pouring with sweat, Billie pushes harder and harder to find herself LAST. Eleanor anxiously awaits the baton.
C: ELEANOR
D: Hurry up, Billie! Billie finally sticks the handoff. Eleanor concentrates as she breathes RHYTHMICALLY to count her step count. In the turn, her habitual syncopated cadence is thrown off. She can’t turn her burners on. Barbara sighs heavily as she watches Eleanor’s squinted face approach.
C: BARBARA
D: Dig it out, Eleanor! Handoff complete. Barbara’s usual slick glide is enough to catch the HBCU RUNNER, but she’s a step away from the HIGH
C: SCHOOL RUNNER.
D: Wilma keeps her eyes locked forward as Barbara approaches. She holds out her hand. Flat. Palm upwards... waiting to accept. As Barbara goes to deliver the baton with a single swift deliberate smack, they bobble the handoff AGAIN!
C: BARBARA
D: Damnit! They try to stick it again, but go outside of their changeover zone! Billie and Eleanor immediately double over. Ed lays into the whistle. FWEET!!!!!
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Disqualified!
C: BARBARA
D: Why can’t you keep your hand still?
E: to Wilma
C: WILMA
D: I didn’t make us go out the zone!
C: BILLIE
D: BJ, you the one who messed up. Barbara spins around ready to unload, but Eleanor hops in.
C: ELEANOR
D: Stay out of it. We wouldn’t be here if you got out the blocks on time.
E: to Billie
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Girls.
C: BARBARA
D: If Skeeter’d stop showing off--
C: WILMA
D: --I know you ain’t talking!
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Enough! Barbara and Wilma stop arguing.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: See, this right here is why coaches don’t mess with girls. This is why I didn’t want this team in the first place. The Tigerbelles are stung and hurt by all this.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: How can anybody else take y’all seriously if you don’t take yourselves seriously? I can’t get y’all to focus for two seconds on the track cause you’re always distracted by booze and boys! Seething, Ed starts to walk away.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Baton handoffs and conditioning at five a.m. sharp.
E: CONT’D over his shoulder
C: BILLIE
D: That’s too early. Ed spins around, his fury and disappointment with them swirls on his hardened face.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: If you can stay in a bottle of liquor that late, you can get up that early. Ed goes over to the COACHES, REFEREES, and other RUNNERS. Jesse sympathetically looks at Wilma. Barbara, embarrassed, avoids Wendell’s gaze. Demoralized, dejected and DQ’d... they stand as the most separate foursome ever. EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - KEAN HALL - NIGHT The smooth, low rumble of a BARITONE SAX BLOWS while a TRIO OF FEMALES SINGERS snap their fingers to the beat. The R&B MUSIC from the LIVE BAND weaves through the elegantly dressed COLLEGE COUPLES dancing. Hanging sign read: HOMECOMING 1959.
C: AT A PHOTO BACKDROP
D: Wilma and Robert pose for formal portraits. Robert’s suit is a little ill-fitting and unstylish. It’s definitely more of a hand-me-down Sunday suit than a formal one. Barbara and Wendell sit with Eleanor. Naturally, Barbara’s decked out fabulously. Eleanor has done little to transform her look. She still clings to her infamous notebook.
C: BARBARA
D: You taking notes on how to have a good time?
E: re: Eleanor’s notebook
C: ELEANOR
D: I’ll write that one down.
C: BARBARA
D: You need to be writing down how Coach is playing favorites.
C: ELEANOR
D: He’s a fair man.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh, really? He catches Skeeter with Jesse and nothing. He ran me and Billie for three hours after practice that night. That seem fair to you? Barbara stops her rant to take a bite off her plate. Eleanor jots something down in her notebook.
C: BARBARA
D: Are you writing down what I'm eating to tell Coach?
E: CONT’D
C: ELEANOR
D: Who do you think sent me here to chaperone?
C: BARBARA
D: Eleanor! Dang, can’t you be one of us for second?! Billie arrives, turning heads, but dressed more for a nightclub than a formal. She catches Wilma’s eye.
E: aghast
C: WILMA
D: Hey, Billie. Looking good. Wilma gives her a warm smile, but Billie simply ignores her and walks on. Wilma’s face falls. Then--
C: BARBARA
D: Billie! Over here! Billie perks up and Wilma notices, hurt. Billie walks over to join Barbara and Eleanor. She sizes up Eleanor’s attire.
C: BILLIE
D: No man tonight, Eleanor? Oh wait, that’s every night. In fun, Billie winks. Eleanor merely responds with an unbothered look.
C: BARBARA
D: Billie’s right, Eleanor. You keep dressing dowdy like that you’re gonna end up an Old Maid. Eleanor scans her attire. WITH WILMA ACROSS THE ROOM Robert notices a cloud cross Wilma's face; she’s noticed the cold shoulder Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor are giving her.
C: WILMA
D: I'm gonna go get some punch. I'll meet you back at the table. Robert heads to join the Tigerbelles and their DATES. As Wilma heads for the punch, Jesse enters in his well-cut, stylish and sharp suit. He stops her en route.
C: JESSE
D: You look better than mama's biscuits tonight, girl.
N: WITH ROBERT AT THE TIGERBELLES’ TABLE
C: ROBERT
D: Y’all ready for the white folks’ track meet?
C: ELEANOR
D: Won’t be white anymore after we get there. We are the TSU Integrators! Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor give each other hand-slides and self-assured nods; they proudly smile at the accomplishment.
C: ROBERT
D: I never woulda thought Skeeter going to college would take her all the way to The Big Apple.
C: BARBARA
D: That’s where Wendell and I are moving once he finishes dental school. Wendell looks over at Barbara, confused.
C: ROBERT
D: You gonna be a dentist?
C: WENDELL
D: I guess so. And a Yankee too, apparently. Everyone laughs. Suddenly, the Crowd starts CHEERING. The MC of the event comes to the front of the stage.
C: MC
D: Now bringing y’all the one, the only... Mr. Ray Charles! FINGERS start to pound the piano keys, playing the opening notes of “What’d I Say.” Eleanor puts her notebook down and jumps up, clapping to the beat. Billie and Barbara both join her, screaming with excitement.
C: BILLIE
D: Ray!!!! RAY CHARLES, 29, does his signature side rock as the TSU Crowd goes wild.
C: RAY CHARLES
D: ‘Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong. Come and love me all night long. Oh oh, hey hey.’
E: singing
N: As Barbara, Billie, Eleanor, and Wendell dance, Robert’s on cloud nine. He searches through the Crowd. Suddenly, he looks like he got hit by a truck. Jesse and Wilma are dancing! Jesse holds Wilma’s hand as he gets into the dance. She giggles with joy.
C: ROBERT
D: What the hell? Billie turns around to find Robert clenching his teeth. She nudges Barbara. They watch Robert, pissed, cut through the Crowd toward them.
E: to himself
C: BILLIE
D: Let’s see her get outta this one. Robert comes up behind Wilma. His eyes cutting into Jesse.
C: ROBERT
D: Who the hell is he? Wilma spins around seeing Robert’s scrunched face.
C: WILMA
D: Oh, this is Jesse. He’s in my Math class.
C: ROBERT
D: I don’t think they teaching y’all to move like that in Math class. Jesse slides in between Wilma and Robert.
C: JESSE
D: Just calm down, man.
C: ROBERT
D: I don’t wanna hear nothing you gotta say. You hear me? Eleanor has now joined Barbara and Billie in looking at the brewing tension between Robert and Jesse.
C: ELEANOR
D: Good Lord. Eleanor grabs Barbara and Billie, quickly pulling them toward Wilma, Robert, and Jesse. Wilma steps in between Jesse and Robert.
C: WILMA
D: You stop this now.
E: to Robert
C: ROBERT
D: Is he why you don’t come home to me and Yolan--
C: WILMA
D: --Don’t!
C: ROBERT
D: Oh, that’s right. He don’t know.
C: WILMA
D: Please, Robert. Not here.
C: ROBERT
D: Why don’t you please stop telling me lies?
C: WILMA
D: I’m not lying to you. Robert isn’t convinced.
C: JESSE
D: Go on home, Robert. When Jesse puts his hand on Wilma’s shoulder, a rage sets across Robert’s face.
C: ROBERT
D: Stay away from my girl! Robert PUNCHES Jesse. The Tigerbelles SCREAM as Jesse hits the floor.
C: WILMA
D: Robert! Jesse collects himself and begins to return the punches. A couple of his FOOTBALL TEAMMATES run over. Wendell and his FRAT BROTHERS rush in to shut this down... they hold back Jesse and his Teammates from Robert. Wilma looks mortified, Barbara and Eleanor are appalled, but Billie is smugly satisfied.
C: ELEANOR
D: This isn’t funny, Billie.
C: BILLIE
D: Oh, I know it ain’t. Wilma looks over at Billie who makes sure to speak loud enough for Wilma to hear.
C: BILLIE
D: Neither was running all night.
E: CONT’D
N: Billie’s very pointed with this and Wilma can do nothing, but run out of the room.
C: ELEANOR
D: That was Coach’s call, Billie. Not Skeeter’s. There’s truth in this and Billie knows it. Pride still bigger than reasoning, Billie shrugs her shoulders and walks off. EXT. PARKING LOT - ROBERT’S PICKUP TRUCK - LATER THAT NIGHT Solemn, Wilma and Robert lean against his truck.
C: WILMA
D: You embarrassed me.
C: ROBERT
D: Embarrassed you? You had me in there looking like a plum fool!
C: WILMA
D: I told you Jesse’s just a friend.
C: ROBERT
D: I don’t need no college degree to
C: know what I saw.
D: Robert hops in his truck.
C: WILMA
D: Don’t leave. Robert doesn’t bother to respond. He speeds off leaving Wilma alone in the parking lot. EXT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING The Tigerbelles load their suitcases into the back of Coach Temple’s station wagon. Ed kneels down in front of Edwina and Lloyd. C.B. stands behind them.
C: EDWINA
D: Will you bring us gifts from New York, Daddy?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Depends if y’all are gonna be good for your mama.
C: EDWINA
D: We will! He gives each of the them a kiss goodbye. When Ed goes to hug C.B., she hands him a box full of BAGGED LUNCHES. Clearly, there won’t be any hugs coming his way. He peers over his shoulder to make sure The Tigerbelles can’t hear.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You still mad at me?
C: C.B. doesn’t say anything. COACH TEMPLE
D: If I could stay to support your
E: CONT’D
C: little event, I would.
D: She’s taken aback by his phrasing.
C: C.B.
D: ‘Little event?’
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You know what I mean, C.B.
C: C.B.
D: I’m beginning to see that. He checks again to make sure they aren’t being overhead.
C: COACH TEMPLE Baby, I apologized. C.B.
D: You can’t take your team giving excuses, but you’re quick to give ‘em yourself, aren’t you? C.B. takes out a few bagged lunches from the box. She puts on a smile and goes over to join The Tigerbelles at the car. She hands each girl a paper bag.
C: C.B.
D: Lunch bag for the trip, ladies. Coach wants to limit the stops. Wilma and Billie peer into the paper bag. THEIR POV: There’s a SANDWICH wrapped in wax paper, an APPLE, a COOKIE, and an EMPTY MASON JAR. Wilma and Billie sneak a look at each other in confusion about the empty jar.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA BILLIE
D: Thank you, ma'am. Thanks, Mrs. Temple. Barbara and Eleanor give C.B. a warm smile of appreciation.
C: C.B.
D: You're welcome, girls. But if you wanna thank me, y’all do your best. And I know your best is nothing short of winning.
N: The Tigerbelles beam at C.B.’s support. Ed uses this warm moment as a nice segue into stealing a kiss goodbye. C.B. returns it, but it’s not the warmest moment.
C: C.B.
D: Be careful, Ed. He watches her put her arms around Edwina and Lloyd. Nearby, Jesse jogs up with his bag. He tosses it in the car. Wilma pulls Jesse to the side for privacy.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: Jesse, I’m sorry about what happened at the dance.
C: JESSE
D: It wasn’t your fault. Beautiful girls make men do crazy things. Don’t you worry about it. Barely a scratch. Wilma is thankful for his playing down the severity.
C: JESSE
D: Now let’s get on the road. EXT. NASHVILLE / INT. COACH TEMPLE’S STATION WAGON - DAY Jesse drives while Ed sits shotgun, going over paperwork. Wilma gazes out the window. HER POV: The car passes MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE, where she was treated as a child. An OLDER WOMAN with polio comes out on crutches with the aid of a NURSE. Wilma adjusts the brace that Ed makes her wear... a constant reminder of how her childhood struggles are still with her. I/E. COACH TEMPLE’S STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON They’re deep in countryside now. Jesse flips on the radio. "Baby You've Got What it Takes" by Brook Benton and Dinah Washington. Barbara wiggles uncomfortably in her seat.
E: CONT’D
C: BARBARA
D: Um... Coach? I need to stop.
C: BILLIE
D: For what? You can't be hungry, you already ate your sandwich.
C: ELEANOR
D: And half of mine.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: No unscheduled stops. We’ll stretch our legs once we get to Philadelphia. Wilma watches Barbara continue to squirm in her seat.
C: WILMA
D: Well, how far away is that?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I don't know. 300 miles or so.
C: BARBARA
D: Coach, I cannot wait that long. I need to use the ladies’ room now.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: If you have to do your business, do your business. The Girls are confused. Wilma fishes around her lunch sack and pulls out her empty jar.
C: WILMA
D: Uh... The Tigerbelles looks vary from disgust to disbelief.
E: realizing
C: BARBARA
D: What? I'm not peeing in no jar.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Well, we're not stopping so figure it out. When I was a runner back in the day, we used jars when we traveled. There's a modesty sheet behind you if you need it. They check the space behind them to see a FOLDED SHEET.
C: ELEANOR
D: Coach, these are young ladies here.
C: BARBARA
D: I will not, I cannot... pee in a jar.
C: JESSE
D: Coach, it's fine. I can pull over.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: No, you can't. We're a car of Negroes driving through Virginia. I don't want any run-ins.
C: ELEANOR
D: Didn’t you bring a Green Book? Surely it can direct us to a safe place to stop.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Yes, of course I have it! There are no places listed that are welcoming to Negroes until we get into Maryland. We're not stopping. Like I said, if you need to do your business, do your business. Barbara looks disgustedly and inquisitively at the jar.
E: holds up a Green Book
C: BARBARA
D: How? How exactly am I supposed to do this?
C: ELEANOR
D: Sir, she’s right. The equipment and mechanics is a little different from men.
C: BILLIE
D: How would you know?
C: BARBARA
D: If I tell my Daddy that you took us on an eight hundred mile road trip and wouldn't pull over so that we could relieve ourselves with the tiniest bit of dignity, that you had us use mason jars while two men sat within arms reach in the front seat... he will blow his top. And you do not want my Daddy to blow his top. EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER The Station Wagon pulls over to a wooded area near a dirt driveway that leads down to a property. The Tigerbelles climb out, a little triumphant. Jesse glances after them, Ed throws him the modesty sheet to cover his eyes. WITH THE GIRLS IN THE BUSHES They stride hurriedly into the bushes to pee. Barbara is especially vexed and struggling with her fussy coat and purse to hurry and relieve herself.
E: indignantly
C: WILMA
D: BJ, why did you bring your pocketbook?
C: BARBARA
D: Because it matches my shoes. Eleanor and Billie just stare at her in disbelief.
C: BILLIE
D: Can you believe that man?
E: then
C: BARBARA
D: I know. Suggesting we pee in a jar?
C: WILMA
D: And he was serious.
C: ELEANOR
D: The idea of treating us no differently than male athletes certainly has its limitations. They all squat down to pee. BACK WITH ED AND JESSE They stretch their legs outside of the station wagon. A POLICE CAR approaches. Ed motions to Jesse.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Pretend like you checking the tire. Jesse does as told. A WHITE OFFICER looks out of his window, taking in the scene as he drives slowly. Jesse fiddles with the tire. Ed holds his breath. But the Officer doesn’t stop, he drives off. Ed and Jesse exhale in relief. Then...
C: A FARM TRUCK
D: ...toting a FARM DOG pulls up onto the property. It slows upon seeing Ed and Jesse. They tense up. The Tigerbelles emerge from the bushes jovial and buoyant. The DOG begins to
C: BARK wildly.
D: The driver’s door opens slowly... a SHOTGUN BARREL appears through the crack. The door swings open to reveal a pimple- faced WHITE BOY, 14, dressed in too-large overalls. The gun’s so heavy it’s awkward in his arms.
C: WHITE BOY
D: What the hell y’all doin’ on my property?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: We're just leaving. My girls were begging for a pit stop.
C: WHITE BOY
D: A ‘piss stop?’ You pulled over to piss on my land? Barbara tries to maintain a straight face at his blunder.
C: BARBARA
D: Your land? You own this? Ed throws her a death glare. Eleanor slyly hits Barbara in her side to shut up.
C: WHITE BOY
D: My daddy do. And he ain’t gon’ be happy ‘bout a bunch of niggers pullin’ on his land. Everyone stiffens. Ed knows this could go badly.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Young man, sir, I'm sorry. We didn't realize. We meant no disrespect, sir. The Tigerbelles watch Ed’s humble plea. This is a side of their coach they've never seen before.
C: BARBARA
D: Sir? That child’s voice hasn’t even changed yet. Ed shoots her another look to keep quiet, as do Jesse and the rest of the Girls.
E: under her breath
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: We're just driving through on our way to New York for the track and field National Championships. We don't want any trouble, sir. We'll be on our way. The White Boy, with his gun clumsily and dangerously aimed at the group, steps closer to the station wagon.
C: WHITE BOY
D: I reckon that’s a good idea.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Thank you, sir. Get in the car. They hurriedly climb inside, not daring to look back.
E: to Jesse and the Girls
S: INT. COACH TEMPLE’S STATION WAGON - MOMENTS LATER
N: Everyone sits shaken by this close call. Jesse tries to lighten the mood.
C: JESSE
D: Much as y’all have been training, you could’ve outrun his rusty old truck. That mangy mutt too. Wilma and the Girls force a chuckle. But Ed’s grim, still affected by the moment.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Were y’all gonna outrun the bullets, too? Everyone goes quiet.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: And, Barbara... Ed turns, looks Barbara squarely in the eye.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You might not know this, but I’m
E: CONT’D
C: from Philadelphia. I understand
D: Northern thought. But that Chicago mouth and attitude is gonna get you in a world of trouble down here in the South. Your tail best learn when to button that lip pretty damn quick if you wanna live. Ed faces forward.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Now tell your daddy that. Everyone sits in silence and reflection. EXT. HARLEM STREETS - DUSK The station wagon crosses 125th Street and into Harlem. STYLISH BLACK PEOPLE cruise the streets. Ed’s station wagon pulls up outside of the HOTEL THERESA. INT. HOTEL THERESA - MOMENTS LATER The Tigerbelles bubble with excitement.
E: CONT’D
C: ELEANOR
D: Coach, I think it might be a good idea if we stretch our legs and get the blood flowing before tomorrow.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Good thinking. I’ll see if we can run in the alley out back.
C: ELEANOR
D: I meant a walk, sir. There are some important historical landmarks nearby. And we are students first. Ed is grumpy, but it’s hard to argue with her logic.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Okay, but be back in three hours. Jesse, you’re bunking with me. Don't make me regret giving you some slack.
E: to the Girls
C: BILLIE
D: Come on, Eleanor. Introduce us to this ‘Apollo’ fella. Before Eleanor has a chance to protest, Billie and Barbara hook her arm and whisk her away. Only Jesse and Wilma remain.
C: JESSE
D: I was thinking I'd find a bite to eat. Wanna join me? EXT. HARLEM - STRIVER’S ROW - LATER THAT NIGHT The LIGHTS sparkle. Romantic. Idyllic. Wilma and Jesse walk.
C: WILMA
D: My mama told me I could take on anything in the whole world. Didn’t ever think it’d take me here. Jesse takes this in.
C: JESSE
D: Sounds like a wise woman. Wilma’s mind wanders...
C: WILMA
D: I was a really sick child.
C: JESSE
D: Polio?
E: somewhat certain
C: WILMA
D: Yeah. Doctors said I’d never walk again. My mother said I would. I believed my mother.
E: beat
N: Jesse looks at her anew; taking her in with awe.
C: JESSE
D: Never supposed to walk and now here you are... a college track star. Well, you've certainly made a recovery. In every way. He sweetly compliments her figure. Wilma blushes and deflects, embarrassed by the attention.
C: WILMA
D: Well, what's your story?
C: JESSE
D: My people are from North Carolina. It's just me and my older brother as far as kids go. He sorta fell into the family business. Farming. He didn't finish high school and I decided I didn't want that life. I knew that college was gonna be the only way to get outta there.
C: WILMA
D: So, was it football that brought
C: you to TSU? JESSE
D: Yep. I’m trying to go pro. So, uh, after all this, you’re just gonna go right back home? To Robert?
E: beat
C: WILMA
D: Not back to him, but my family. I mean, where else am I supposed to go? I wish there was something like football for us, but there’s not. So, I’ll go back home and teach.
C: JESSE
D: You’ve faced so many limitations in life, why limit your dreams?
C: WILMA
D: I ain’t think I was. Being a teacher is dreaming too low?
C: JESSE
D: Not at all. Thinking track has to stop at graduation is.
C: WILMA
D: That’s a long way off. And if I can’t pass Algebra, it won’t make a difference anyway. Jesse folds his arms, disagreeing.
C: JESSE
D: You built it up to an A-.
C: WILMA
D: Thanks to you.
C: JESSE
D: I’m your backup, Skeeter. You’ve always been the star.
N: Damn, he’s too sweet. Wilma meets his eyes. Jesse takes her hand. Wilma’s hesitant as hell, her uncertain eyes meeting Jesse’s as he takes a step closer to her. The romantic energy is palpable. He leans in and the romantic moment overtakes Wilma’s initial resistance. They kiss with the lights of the big city twinkling all around them. E/I. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - MORNING CIRCUS TRUCKS pack up outside with ANIMALS, JUGGLERS, ACROBATS, CARNIES, the whole nine yards. Ed leads The Tigerbelles past the spectacle. Ahead of them lies the track. In the middle of the field are a sea of WHITE TRACK TEAMS warming up. Bodies buzz around in every direction. The Tigerbelles take in the scope of the event. The stakes could not be more visual: They are the only Black runners here.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Ok, girls. We have everything to prove today. Doing well here will change how TSU thinks about women’s track. That means better equipment, more scholarships...
C: BARBARA
D: I’m not on scholarship. Wilma and Billie both jab her.
E: under her breath
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: We have to prove that we have the right to be here. I need complete focus and 110%. Eleanor, run ‘em through the warm up. Ed gets in the TEAM CHECK-IN LINE. It’s long and disorganized.
N: He stands behind COACH ABERNATHY, 50, the white coach of the Texas team featured in the Sports Illustrated article. Ed does some small talk.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I thought this meet would be a little more organized. I mean, when a circus prevents you from a proper warm up. Coach Abernathy finally looks at Ed. He doesn’t seem to be impressed, rather Abernathy’s amused.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH ABERNATHY
D: You’re out of your element, boy. Ed eyes Coach Abernathy from head to toe. Ed isn’t impressed by him either.
E: matter of fact
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: The name is Temple. See you on the track... Abernathy. Abernathy’s surprised by this and takes a sudden interest in Ed, watching him closely as he walks away.
C: A FEW YARDS AWAY
D: The Tigerbelles begin to unload near the TEXAS TRACK TEAM. Barbara leans toward Wilma, Billie, and Eleanor.
C: BARBARA
D: Look. It's them. The ‘cover girls.’ The Texas Team stare at The Tigerbelles who stare back... each sizing each other up. We recognize JANICE, the Sports Illustrated cover girl; a tall, immaculately groomed blonde.
E: whispers
C: WILMA
D: How can they run with their hair that high?
C: BILLIE
D: A foot tall bee hive, but no ‘bee- hinds.’ Eleanor stares at them as they warm-up. They’ve got a military-like precision to their training.
C: ELEANOR
D: Maybe it’ll slow them down.
C: WILMA
D: We’re fast too.
C: BARBARA
D: Yeah, but we just got beat by some menopausal women.
C: ELEANOR
D: They were in their mid-twenties!
C: BARBARA
D: Hitting too close to home?
C: BILLIE
D: Eleanor’s two weeks away from being asked to join the Mother Board. Meanwhile, Janice whispers to her own Team. They glance over to The Tigerbelles and laugh, talking shit of their own.
C: BILLIE
D: You got something to say to me? Ed walks up, flipping through paperwork.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Girls, don't talk about it, be about it. Save it for the track.
C: WILMA
D: If we struggle and lose to these white girls... Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor know the stakes. It weighs heavily on them. Ed squats down, making sure all eyes are on them.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Blacks folks have struggle tattooed on our souls, yet we keep on going. Ed hands them their numbers.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: We have eight races today. Billie, you're up first in the 200 heat. Lane seven. Eleanor, confused, scans her notebook.
E: CONT’D
C: ELEANOR
D: Why is she in lane seven? Her times have earned her a center lane!
C: BILLIE
D: Yeah, Coach! Now I’ve gotta deal with the turn. That’s not fair.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Someone’s moving the goalpost on us. Nothing new. But a hurdle ain’t nothing to a track athlete, right? You just run your race. Encouraged, the Tigerbelles nod in agreement. ON THE TRACK - MINUTES LATER Janice is in lane five, the best lane, shaking herself loose. Billie passes directly over her blocks to mess with her. Janice tries to seem unfazed. THE STARTER readies himself on the sidelines. All RUNNERS settle themselves into the blocks.
C: BILLIE
D: Hey, Blondie. Janice slightly looks over at Billie.
C: BILLIE
D: You're in my lane. BAM! The Starter FIRES the starting pistol. Janice falters getting out of the blocks. Billie’s off like a dart. The other Runners struggle to keep stride with her. Billie crosses the finish line FIRST and with panache. The Tigerbelles all CHEER. Ed remains stoic.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Barbara, you're up next! Ed notes the grandness of the Crowd and the arena. Barbara takes off her warmup sweats.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Hey, show this city what you got. Barbara nods and struts her way up to her starting block. BAM! Barbara WINS her heat without once even looking at her competition. As she crosses the finish line, her eyes are caught up in all of the SPECTATORS in the stands. Coach Abernathy YELLS at his Team. He glares at Ed, not happy about how his team is doing. Ed pulls Wilma aside.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Take off the brace. You’re ready.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: But I need it for my stride.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Trust me, Wilma. You’re ready to run without it now. Wilma’s unsure, but hands the brace over. Ed notes Abernathy talking to an OFFICIAL. The Official strides over.
C: OFFICIAL
D: Mr. Temple, I'm going to need to check out your team's cleats before the relay.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Why's that?
C: OFFICIAL
D: We need to ensure that your spikes comply with indoor regulations. A wry smile crosses Ed’s lips; he recognizes this strategic attempt by Coach Abernathy.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Alright, then. Cleats off, girls, so we can get back to work. Ed hands the cleats over to the Official, never taking his eyes off Abernathy. The Tigerbelles stand huddled together, feeling very small in this large arena.
C: ELEANOR
D: They're just trying to throw us off our game.
C: WILMA
D: They’re trying to ice us.
C: BILLIE
D: I’m too hot to be iced. Billie licks her finger and makes a SIZZLING SOUND as she touches her butt.
C: BILLIE
D: And y’all are too, for damn sure. She touches The Tigerbelles and makes the same sizzle sound. They all giggle, relax, and stand taller. The Official returns to Ed with the cleats.
E: CONT’D
C: OFFICIAL
D: Looks like everything checks out. Ed collects the Tigerbelles.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Girls, they stole our lane and tried to stall us out. We don’t have the tools to beat them at their game, but we can certainly beat them at ours. Show ‘em what being a Tigerbelle is all about. They put on their cleats and line up for their relay. Eleanor is the lead off. Barbara’s 2nd, Billie’s 3rd and Wilma’s the anchor. Wilma looks into the Crowd, slightly nervous. Jesse catches her eye, and motions for her to peacock. She does a few large stretches and huge leaps to stretch. The RUNNERS next to her watch. She is ready.
C: AT THE STARTING BLOCK
D: Eleanor takes her place at the starting block. BAM! The pistol fires. ELEANOR takes off, neck and neck with the Texans. There’s a clean handoff to Barbara, who’s charged by the Crowd. She keeps pace with the Texans and passes to Billie who... SLIPS as she takes off. Not a huge fall but enough of a stumble to lose ground to the Texans, who begin to gain. She hands the baton to Wilma, who is now behind. ED watches Wilma as she digs deep, and makes up all the ground that Billie just lost. Through pure determination, she crosses the line FIRST!!! It's an amazing performance. An emphatic win. The Tigerbelles CHEER.
C: TIGERBELLES
D: Yes! We did it! Woo-hoo! But it's CRICKETS in the stands. WHITE SPECTATORS walk out silently without cheering. Ed clocks this, but the Tigerbelles are oblivious, caught up in their victory with hugs and cheers.
E: at once
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Congratulations. Y’all came to New York and made a statement. And you, Wilma, you have arrived. Wilma smiles shyly. Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor stand by waiting to receive their individual praise, but it doesn’t come. The smiles stiffen on their faces. A TRACK OFFICIAL comes up to them.
C: TRACK OFFICIAL
D: Great job out there today. You guys are going to give everyone a run for their money in Mexico City.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: What’s in Mexico City?
C: TRACK OFFICIAL
D: Pan-American Games. Olympic trials. Ed and the Tigerbelles stand, stunned by the revelation. INT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Dishes clang and clatter as C.B. cleans up after dinner, pissed.
E: surprised
C: C.B.
D: No, Ed! You said New York was last. That’s what you promised.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: But baby, I had no way of knowing we would do this well.
C: C.B.
D: Why is it that you’re fine to break a commitment to me, but not to the team?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Honey, that’s not it. It’s just... it’s the Olympic trials.
C: C.B.
D: And then it’ll be the Olympics.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Exactly. Forget kissing Walter’s ass for a piddly job he doesn’t want me to have when I can be an Olympic coach. That’s what’s gonna take me to the next level.
C: C.B.
D: What’s next after that, Ed? There’s always gonna be something with you. This irks Ed.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: That ‘always something’ is what keeps us in this house. ‘Always something’ is what putting food on the table.
C: C.B.
D: Oh, so doing what you’re supposed to for your family makes it okay to put everybody else on the back burner? I swear you’re the smartest man I know, but that is the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I work this hard for us!
C: C.B.
D: You work this hard for you! When is it gonna be your turn to have my back like I’ve had yours every damn day?! When? ‘Six more weeks?’ Or six more after that? Ed throws the dishrag in the sink.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I just need time. Why can’t you get that?
C: C.B.
D: And I need a husband who’s gonna let me have my time to succeed. A man who doesn’t mind giving his time to make my dream come true. Now, when are you gonna get that? He snatches his jacket and heads out before he snaps back. INT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - LIBRARY - MORNING Wilma re-shelves books. She glances around, then pulls a thick LEATHER TOME off the cart. It’s an OLYMPIC HISTORY BOOK. She flips through it. INSERT: PHOTOS of MALE OLYMPIANS. WHITE FEMALE OLYMPIANS. Wilma flips with purpose, then finally stops. INSERT: A TINY PHOTO of ALICE COLEMAN, the first Black woman to win a gold medal. Wilma traces a finger over the gold medal. A new goal. EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - DAY TRUMPETS AND TROMBONES BLARE and DRUMS POUND as the MARCHING BAND AND DRUM LINE train. Nearby the FOOTBALL TEAM push brand new shiny football sleds. Ed leads Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor away from the track and to...
S: EXT. EMPTY FIELD - SAME TIME
N: Ed stops in an empty field where the OLD JUNKED CAR sits abandoned.
C: WILMA
D: What's this?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Your new trainer. He can’t help but to glance at the football team and their new sleds.
C: ELEANOR WILMA
D: What? You gotta be kidding me. Billie and Barbara share in their dismay.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: This meet will be like no other meet you’ve ever gone to. We've gotta step up our training if we wanna be contenders.
C: BILLIE
D: So now he wants oxes not foxes?
E: under her breath
C: BARBARA
D: He don’t even want to coach us.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I was wrong to say that to y’all. That wasn’t right and to be honest,
C: I wasn’t nearby true. BARBARA
D: Lord, hell done froze over.
E: under her breath
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: It’s not right for me to correct y’all when you wrong, but not call out myself for falling short. The Tigerbelles all nod in agreement. Apology accepted. Ed walks toward the abandoned car.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Now, a relay team needs to work in sync if they wanna win. He pats the broken down junker.

N: MONTAGE - JUNK YARD TRAINING UNDER A DRUM LINE BEAT: -- The Girls struggle to push the car. Half of the wheels are flat and barely turn. -- The Girls are out of sync in their pushing of the car. Frustrated, they BARK OUT instructions at one another. -- The car begins to move more quickly. The Girls now more in step with one another, but now the car needs steering. -- Ed recruits a SKINNY MARCHING BAND MEMBER from a LINEUP of STUDENTS that range from a RAIL-THIN WOODWIND PLAYER to a
C: GIGANTIC TUBA PLAYER.
D: -- The Skinny Marching Band Member steers the clunker as the Tigerbelles pull it around the track. -- More MARCHING BAND MEMBERS are inside the car as the Girls continue to pull it around the track. POV FROM INSIDE THE CAR: The Marching Band Members excitedly check out the Girls’ butts as they pull the clunker around the track. Billie turns around, catching them. She hikes her shorts up a little higher to really give them a show. -- President Davis watches skeptically from the sidelines. -- Ed brings over the GIGANTIC TUBA PLAYER.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh no, I'm not pushing Tubby.
C: WILMA
D: C’mon, y’all. Let's just do it. -- The Tigerbelles pull the packed car, complete with the Tuba Player. It's slow going. A CROWD, including Jesse, have gathered to watch. The Tuba Player plays his instrument out the top of the car; the SLOW TOOTS match the pace of the car being pulled. -- As the car gains speed, Ed sends more BAND MEMBERS to jump on the car. The Tigerbelles continue to gain speed as TUBA BEAT QUICKENS. They complete their lap! They jump on the hood as the CROWD CHEERS them on. Ed’s proud, but tries to hide it. President Davis approaches with intense heat.
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: Ed, this training... it’s just not appropriate for young ladies!
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: They’re athletes, sir. They have to be strong.
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: Pulling around scrap metal? Toting around men? It doesn’t look right, and you are putting their fertility in jeopardy. Ed shakes his head at Davis.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: My girls aren’t thinking about children right now. They’re focused on studying and breaking that tape.
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: Exactly. And that’s why I need to make sure I am thinking about their long term well-being.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You mean the university’s well- being.
N: Taken aback by Ed’s audacity, his eyes dig into Ed.
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: I’m putting a stop to this. President Davis, irritated, walks off in a huff. EXT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH, CAPITOL HILL - DAY A CHOIR SINGS. C.B. sings along as Ed sits next to her. Wilma, Barbara, and Eleanor are by his side; they’re in full on “fox” mode. Billie slides in late with sunglasses, grinning at Eleanor.
E: NASHVILLE
C: ELEANOR
D: From the pub to the pews. Several pews away, President Davis and his dignified wife, MARY, sing along in a very reserved manner. The choir selection ends and the PASTOR takes the pulpit.
E: under her breath
C: PASTOR
D: Amen! Glory be to Him. Can you feel His love? For those of y’all who don’t know, we got some joyful news last weekend. Our own Brother Temple and his Tigerbelles brought home a big win. These young ladies are the first women's Negro college team to win a national championship--
E: nods to Coach Temple
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: --First Negro team period!
E: yelling from the pews
C: PASTOR
D: Amen! Brother Temple, c’mon up here and spread the good word? Ed heads to the pulpit.
E: chuckles
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I truly believe God has a larger purpose for these young ladies. See, this here is bigger than banners. Bigger than medals. Bigger than the school name that’s on their uniforms. Members of the Congregation nods.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: These girls are the only Black faces some of these track meets have ever seen. And that’s why this is bigger than track, cause these girls represent all of us. I don’t have to tell y’all that some folks don’t wanna see us. Ed glances over at Davis. He clenches his teeth, closely monitoring Ed.
E: CONT’D beat
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: But when you have a light you don’t hide it in a bushel, you shine it. The Mother Board lead the way with “Amens.”
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Now there’s another competition on the horizon in Mexico City. It’s the step we need to qualify for The Olympics so the world can see. But we need help to shine brightly. If the world is gonna see these ladies, we need to make sure they see that greatness. He looks around, trying to figure out his next move. He spots MRS. ENDICOTT, 60, stern looking, refined woman.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Mrs. Endicott over there has been raising up women to show their greatness through finer womanhood.
E: CONT’D MORE
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I know many of our wives came up through Mrs. Endicott. The Deacons throw their hands in the air to echo this fact.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: She showed ‘em grace and etiquette. The CONGREGATION stirs in excitement.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Mrs. Endicott, would you keep on that work and help train up our girls for that world stage? Mrs. Endicott primly stands, proud.
E: CONT’D
C: MRS. ENDICOTT Yes, I will. People APPLAUD and CHEER. COACH TEMPLE
D: Amen! Davis shifts in his seat. A DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMEN rises to his feet.
C: DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN
D: I'd be happy to assist with the fundraising. Y’all are gonna need more than another fish fry to get to Mexico.
C: PASTOR
D: Hallelujah. Feeling moved, Mary stands up. Davis stares at her, shocked.
C: MARY
D: And Walter and I would be happy to help get ‘em new uniforms! Ed shoots a coy grin Davis’ way. Davis looks like he could strangle Ed, but puts on a forced smile for the stirred up church. HANDS shoot up in the air as the Congregation offers their services. Ed’s humbled and pleased. The Choir starts SINGING as a collection plate is passed. EXT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH, CAPITOL HILL - LATER President Davis catches Ed as the Tigerbelles chat politely with fawning Congregants nearby.
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: That was a tactical ambush, Ed.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Had to be done.
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: We are supposed to be moving our student body away from stereotypes. Broadening the way the world sees Negroes--
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: --Walter, these girls are doing just that. They aren’t just the best college runners. Not just the best Negro runners. They’re the best American runners in the country. Maybe even the world.
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: Olympic coaches get paid in pride. You think you can survive on pride alone, Ed? Ed reads between the lines.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: What are you trying to say?
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: You’d just better hope you make this Olympic thing happen. Otherwise, you won’t have to worry about Marvin coaching the men. Cause you won’t be coaching or teaching anybody else... definitely
C: not at TSU.
D: The stakes land on him as Davis leaves with a steely gaze. EXT. MEXICO CITY AIRPORT - TARMAC - DAY Various PASSENGERS debark the Boeing 707. Ed’s flanked by Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor. The ladies done their smart suits of all colors, pill box hats, gloves, and carrying hat boxes. They turn all heads in the airport. EXT. MEXICO CITY AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER Ed leads the Tigerbelles to the curb, where there’s a SIGN that says: PAN-AMERICAN GAMES - COACH TEMPLE & THE TIGERBELLES. A suited HOSPITALITY AGENT holds it next to a
C: pristine CHRYSLER IMPERIAL LIMO. BILLIE
D: Now that’s what I’m talking ‘bout.
C: BARBARA
D: Finally got a ride as fine as me. The Tigerbelles are giddy with delight. Hell, Ed is too. The DRIVER opens the door for them.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Buenas tardes. ¿Cómo está su día? The Girls nudge each other, impressed with their coach.
E: perfect pronunciation
C: DRIVER
D: Mi día es un gran agradecimiento, señor.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Bueno escuchar que. Gracias. I/E. LIMO / EXT. MEXICO CITY - MOMENTS LATER Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor are glued to the window, staring out in wonderment at the city. Modernity, colorful, Spanish style buildings, lively. Even Ed stops doing paperwork to take in the sights.
C: NEWS ANNOUNCER
D: Athletes arriving in Mexico City today for the start of the Pan American Games. EXT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - DAY The limo pulls up to an upscale and grand hotel. As Ed and the Tigerbelles get out of the car, they can’t help but to note the ATHLETES at the hotel... it’s NOT SEGREGATED.
E: V.O.
C: NEWS ANNOUNCER
D: These week-long games are Olympic qualifiers, and will determine the national teams for this summer’s Olympics in Rome. Cute MEXICAN GUYS pass by sharing seductive smiles at Billie and the Tigerbelles. Eleanor throws her a warning glance.
E: V.O.
C: BILLIE
D: I know, I know Eleanor. I’m here to focus. Eleanor relaxes and looks away. Billie steals a glance over her shoulder, ogling the butt of one of the GUYS. Her eyes tilt up and sees he has been doing the same to her.
C: BILLIE
D: Lord, gimme strength.
E: CONT’D to herself
S: EXT. MEXICO CITY STREETS - DAY
N: -- The Tigerbelles carry shopping bags as they laugh and talk. Enjoying this adventure. -- MEN flirt with them as they sit at a restaurant... they flirt back. Even Eleanor tucks her flashcards back in her purse, overtaken by the experience. -- The Tigerbelles eat fresh coconut and elotes. -- Barbara puts a few Mexican COMBS in Wilma’s hair and gives her the seal of approval. Wilma buys the combs and a DOLL.
C: END MONTAGE
D: INT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - LOUNGE - NIGHT Ed’s at an International Coaches Gathering. The room hums with casual conversation as HOTEL WAITERS deliver drinks. Ed sits with other Coaches, socializing. He’s an equal here. INT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - BALLROOM - SAME TIME Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor sit in room full of gorgeous YOUNG ATHLETES from all nations.
C: BARBARA
D: That boy did not say that, Billie.
C: BILLIE
D: Swear to God.
C: ELEANOR
D: You can’t even speak Spanish.
C: BILLIE
D: Attraction has its own translation. They LAUGH. Wilma peeks over at the clock in the distance.
C: WILMA
D: Oh, dang. I forgot I’ve gotta make to phone call. I’ll be back.
C: ELEANOR
D: Okay. As Wilma walks out, a LARGE RADIO is wheeled by her. A WORKER plugs it in. BALLROOM MUSIC begins to PLAY. Barbara sways to the music, but Billie and Eleanor aren’t really feeling it.
C: BARBARA
D: This makes me miss Jack-and-Jill.
C: BILLIE
D: Girl, if you brag about that stupid club one more time... I’m gonna tell you something. You ain’t no aristocrat... you a faux-ristocrat. Eleanor almost spits out her drink in laughter, thoroughly amused.
C: BARBARA
D: Whatever. But isn’t this a blast?
C: BILLIE
D: ‘A blast?’ Are you 70? You’ve been watching too much Ed Sullivan, BJ. Billie rolls her eyes at the ballroom music as it swells.
C: BILLIE
D: Hell, my grandmama don’t even listen to this music. Billie goes to the radio and nods to the ATHLETE next to it.
E: CONT'D
C: BILLIE
D: Mind if I change the channel? She surfs the dial until she finds "Don’t Let Go" by Roy Hamilton. She and Barbara start to dance.
E: CONT’D
C: BARBARA
D: Vamanos muchachos! Other INTERNATIONAL ATHLETES join in. It’s infectious, even Eleanor does a move or two. INT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - SAME TIME The combs Wilma bought gleam as brightly in her hair as does the smile on her face.
E: to other Athletes
C: WILMA
D: Hey! It’s me, Charlene! How y’all doing... what’s wrong? Wilma’s face falls, her eyes fill with worry.
E: into phone
C: WILMA
D: Did you call the doctor? Wilma bites her lip in anticipation.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: But I can’t come home right now.
E: CONT’D exhales MORE
C: WILMA
D: Are you sure? Okay, well call me of anything changes. Wilma hangs up and thinks. She faces a difficult decision. INT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - BALLROOM - SAME TIME The dancing Tigerbelles are at the center of a raucous dance party. Everyone’s having the time of their life until...
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Girls. Girls! Tigerbelles!!! Ed wades through the gyrating BODIES on the dance floor. Eleanor tugs at Barbara to show her an incoming Ed. Billie doesn’t see a thing, that is until Ed pulls her to the side.
E: O.S.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Eleanor, you’re supposed to be watching these girls! I can’t believe y’all are wearing out your legs like that the night before a race! In here jitterbugging like some jumping beans! Wilma enters from the phone booth.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: And where have you been?
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: I... I... had to call home.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I’m glad someone on this team ain’t out here acting a fool. Barbara and Billie glare at Wilma... as does Eleanor. Wilma’s so deep in thought she doesn’t even notice any of this.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Party’s over. Get in your rooms. We have a lot on the line tomorrow. I need you on time, in the lobby, looking spick-and-span from head-to- toe. Move! With final dirty looks to Wilma, the rest of The Tigerbelles leave the banquet hall. INT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - ROOM - MORNING Room service breakfast is on the table. Eleanor removes the BIG PINK CURLERS out of her hair, and piles them on the table. Barbara uses HOT CURLERS on Billie’s hair.
E: CONT’D
C: BILLIE
D: I don’t care if she’s faster. All I know is I’m sick and tired of-- Wilma enters from the bathroom, freshly showered. Billie goes quiet, but her bitter eye cutting doesn’t.
C: WILMA
D: Morning.
C: ELEANOR
D: Good morning, Wilma. Wilma’s hair is still undone. She looks at the curlers.
E: a bit cold
C: WILMA
D: How long until you hand those off? The last thing I need today is Coach lecturing about my appearance.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh, it shouldn’t take long. I’m after Billie, and you know I’ve got the good stuff, so it’ll curl quickly. Eleanor rolls her eyes at Barbara’s comment.
C: WILMA
D: Well, maybe I should go first in that case? Barbara and Billie share a secret sidelong glance.
C: BILLIE
D: We already started. Don’t worry. It won’t be long.
C: WILMA
D: Billie, please, you know how Coach gets about our hair.
C: BARBARA
D: Anyways... did you see that cute Italian runner last night?
C: BILLIE
D: Hmm-hmm. They sure don’t have any hang-ups over here. I’d be the coffee to his cream any day. Barbara finishes curling Billie’s hair. She starts to curl her own hair, but at a snail’s pace. Wilma pours herself a bowl of cereal and sits at the table, anxiously eyeing Barbara’s hair in the curlers.
N: Barbara inspects a section of hair. Wilma watches hopefully.
C: BARBARA
D: I’m sorry. It’s taking longer than usual for some reason. I don’t think my hair likes this Mexican weather. Barbara and Billie sly eye each other. Wilma looks in the mirror, concerned. What’s she going to do? EXT. CAMINO REAL HOTEL - LATER Ed stares at his watch, waiting as Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor come out of the lobby. He looks down the line of Girls, all immaculately groomed. Suddenly, Wilma steps out of the hotel wearing a HEAD SCARF. His eyes broaden. Billie and Barbara smirk with satisfaction.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Skeeter! What in God’s name?
C: WILMA
D: Coach, I ran out of time.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Take that mess off before someone sees you! Wilma takes the scarf off and reveals her unkempt hair.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Lord To-day! This child trying to kill me dead. Skeeter, hurry up and cover that head up. Folks are gonna think you haven’t had one lick of home- training. Wilma quickly re-ties the scarf under her neck a la Grace Kelly. Meanwhile, Barbara and Billie are enjoying every minute of his explosion. Some REPORTERS approach them.
E: CONT’D huffs
C: ITALIAN REPORTER
D: Coach Temple! Italian Press. Can we get a quick picture and ask some questions? Barbara and Billie primp in preparation.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: We’re about to leave, guys.
C: ITALIAN REPORTER
D: It won’t take long. We just have a couple of questions.
C: BARBARA
D: About time. Barbara and Billie step forward, even Eleanor has a slight smile. The Italian Reporter turns to Wilma, ignoring them.
C: ITALIAN REPORTER
D: For Wilma.
C: WILMA
D: For me? Embarrassed, pissed, and pushed aside, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor fall into the background.
E: shocked
C: ITALIAN REPORTER
D: Yes. The Italians have been following Olympic hopefuls from around the world very closely. ‘La Gazzella Nera.’ That’s what we call you in Italy.
C: WILMA
D: What’s that mean?
E: to Coach Temple
C: ITALIAN REPORTER
D: ‘The Black Gazelle.’ Ed hesitantly nods for her to go on. Wilma touches her scarf self-consciously as she’s pulled away by Reporters. Barbara and Billie glower; Eleanor’s a little bit jealous.
C: BARBARA
D: We should change our name to ‘The Wilma Rudolph Show featuring The Tigerbelles.’
C: BILLIE
D: Let’s see how good her solo sounds without her backup. EXT. UNIVERSITY STADIUM - TRACK - DAY The Tigerbelles take their places around the track for the relay.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Up next we have the highly anticipated 4x100 relays. First Eleanor, then Barbara, followed by Billie, with Wilma running as anchor.
E: V.O.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: The Americans are anchored by Wilma Rudolph, who took first in both the 100 and 200 meter events earlier yesterday. They look at the competition. PANAMANIANS, ARGENTINIANS,
E: V.O.
C: CANADIANS, all strong-looking athletes.
D: INTERCUT WITH: INT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME C.B. listens to the RADIO as she organizes boxes of books.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: The stakes are high as only the top three teams will compete in Rome this summer at the Olympics... EXT. UNIVERSITY STADIUM - TRACK - SAME TIME Ed looks over and sees the CANADIAN and PANAMANIAN COACHES. They meet his gaze with world-class game-faces. BANG! Eleanor bounds from the blocks.
E: V.O.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: American Eleanor Williams, first out of the blocks, can’t create any distance. Right on her heels is Carlota Gooden of Panama. And now we have the first hand off... Eleanor hands the baton to Barbara who takes off, but not nearly as fast as we’ve seen her go.
E: V.O.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Barbara! Pick up the pace! Chest up! Stride!
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Panama’s Jean Holmes-Mitchell is closing in on the Americans! It is still a battle for first between the US and Panama with the Canadians following closely behind. INT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME C.B. stops organizing, drawn in by the race. EXT. UNIVERSITY STADIUM - TRACK - SAME TIME The Panamanians hand off the baton a split-second before the Tigerbelles.
E: V.O.
N: Barbara hands the baton to Billie, who also takes off at less than top speed. Ed’s losing his mind as he crumpling the paper in his hands.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: What is going on?! You’re running like you’re in quicksand!
C: ANNOUNCER
D: And the Panamanians pull away in this third leg! In a surprising turn of events, the Americans slip into second and seem to have no answers for this Panamanian machine. With Silvia Hunte closing for the Panamanians, it would take nothing short of a miracle from ‘The Black Gazelle’ to save the day. Wilma makes a valiant effort to catch up. She passes FOUR RUNNERS, but isn’t able to make up enough ground to catch 1st or 2nd place. The Tigerbelles place 3rd in a PHOTO FINISH.
E: V.O.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: And there we have it! Silvia Hunte secures a place at the Olympic table for the Panamanians. In second place, we have the Canadians, and with a surprising and disappointing showing, the Americans just barely secure third place in this race. Ed throws his notebook to the ground.
E: V.O.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: This team just did not look together today and this might not bode well for them in Rome. INT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME C.B. turns the radio off and slumps in a chair. EXT. UNIVERSITY STADIUM - STAGING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Billie nonchalantly chews gum as Barbara takes off her cleats. Eleanor wipes off sweat as Wilma sits with her head in her hands. Ed towers over them, livid.
E: V.O.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: What the hell was that? You looked a mess out there today. If it were not for Skeeter digging deep...
C: BILLIE
D: Here we go again.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Long as you out there taking strolls out there on that track, you deadgum right here we go again.
C: BARBARA
D: No, here we go again with ‘Skeeter can do no wrong.’ She’s ‘pretty’ and ‘leggy’ and ‘perfect.’
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: This is not about looks. This is about performance. And the two of you have let this team down.
C: BILLIE
D: Team? This ain’t no team!
C: BARBARA
D: The team don’t get no interviews.
C: BILLIE
D: We need to call this what it really is... ‘Wilma Rudolph and the three also-rans.’ Billie and Barbara’s scowls finally click for Wilma. Her brow slowly furrows.
C: WILMA
D: So that’s why y’all wouldn’t let me use the curlers this morning?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: That’s why your hair was a mess? Wilma gets closer to Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor.
C: WILMA
D: Y’all got mad cause you ain’t getting interviews? I didn’t ask for any of this.
C: BARBARA
D: But you’re not turning it down neither. And you’re definitely not turning down Coach’s special treatment. Maintaining calm, Ed tries to bring this down to a simmer.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: My rules are concrete, BJ. I treat all my runners the same.
N: Lips pursed, Billie and Barbara stare at Ed like he’s crazy.
C: BARBARA
D: ‘Tell the truth, shame the devil.’
C: BILLIE
D: Eleanor? Billie cuts her eyes so deep into Eleanor, that she can’t help but to speak out.
C: ELEANOR
D: You don’t always treat us the same.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Now, that’s not tr--
C: BILLIE
D: --Me and BJ get busted when we break the rules, but Skeeter’s free to run around with her boyfriend at all hours of the night.
C: WILMA
D: I was studying! I actually need good grades, Billie. Ed holds up his hands to pause their back and forth.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Eleanor, did you know about the shenanigans going on with them? Eleanor swallows hard with her teammates’ eyes on her.
E: connecting the dots
C: ELEANOR
D: The curlers, yes. But I didn’t know Billie and BJ were going to throw the race. Ed stops short... never did this even cross his mind. He turns to Billie and Barbara.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Are you telling me y’all just lost that race on purpose?
N: They stay silent for a beat then--
C: BARBARA
D: We were never gonna throw away our shot at the Olympics.
N: Ed shakes his head in disbelief.
C: BILLIE
D: But you and Skeeter needed a reminder that taking first place means y’all need us too.
N: Wilma’s uncorked and angry. It’s all coming out.
C: WILMA
D: After all the bruises and aches, all the sacrifices, after all the time we put in... y’all throw the race over curfew and interviews? This ain’t a game.
C: ELEANOR
D: I’m not playing games.
C: WILMA
D: You might not be in their game, Eleanor, but you’re on the sidelines letting it happen. None of y’all might not mind treating class and track like we in grade school, but I need this.
C: BILLIE
D: Hold up, now. I’ve put in so much sweat, I’ve done damn near flooded most of Nashville.
C: WILMA
D: And that sweat shoulda took us on to victory, but you let it drown us instead! Don’t y’all see that? Livid, Wilma rushes to pack her things.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Where you going?
C: WILMA
D: Home.
C: ELEANOR
D: You can’t leave.
C: WILMA
D: What’s the point of staying? Wilma slings her bag across her body.
C: BILLIE
D: Ain’t nothing back home but chiggers, fire ants, and-- Fed up, Wilma’s had enough and finally lets it out.
C: WILMA
D: --My child. Ed, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor are gut-punched.
C: ELEANOR
D: You have a baby?
C: BARBARA
D: Skeeter? Regret billows Billie’s once stiffened demeanor.
E: softened
C: BILLIE
D: Why ain’t you tell us?
C: WILMA
D: Cause you like pouring water on a drowning woman. Y’all might not need me, but my daughter does. And now she’s sick at home I’m here fighting about hair and chasing folks around a track.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Skeeter, you shoulda come and talked to me--
C: WILMA
D: --‘No mothers on the track,’ ain’t that the rule? This is nonsense. I’m done. Wilma storms off upset, leaving them with dropped jaws. INT. WILMA’S HOUSE - NIGHT Robert gently walks up with Yolanda. Wilma rushes to take Yolanda in his arms. Charlene watches Wilma feel Yolanda’s forehead testing for a fever.
E: trails off near tears
C: WILMA
D: Is she okay? Yolanda CRIES as Wilma holds her tightly.
C: CHARLENE
D: It was a pretty scary fever.
C: ROBERT
D: It was a little touch and go for a while, but it came down. Wilma’s touch doesn’t soothe Yolanda, who reaches out for Charlene.
C: CHARLENE
D: It’s okay. Stay with your mama. Wilma’s heart is breaking. Her tears come pouring. Comforting, Robert lovingly rubs Wilma’s back.
E: to Yolanda
C: WILMA
D: I shoulda stayed here.
N: Robert parts his mouth to speak, but Charlene puts her hand to halt his words. She’s got this.
C: CHARLENE
D: It wouldn’t have stop nothing.
C: WILMA
D: But what was it all for? A child who doesn’t even know me? For so- called teammates to stab me in the back? I call myself doing what I thought I had to do. And it still wasn’t good enough. Wilma pulls the DOLL FROM MEXICO out and gives it to Yolanda. She holds her tight and rocks her, trying to comfort both her baby and herself. EXT. WILMA’S HOUSE - PORCH - DAY Charlene sits next to a massive pile of laundry, scrubbing clothes in a tub by hand. The YOUNG GIRLS help by creating an assembly line that ends at the clothesline. Wilma enters with Yolanda, eyes the laundry.
C: WILMA
D: Y’all didn’t have to do my washing.
C: CHARLENE
D: I just threw it in with the rest. We’re all helping Mama with the laundry anyway. A silent beat off the reality of her family’s work life.
C: CHARLENE
D: Skeeter, what you doing with this track business? You started out running to help pay for school. Now it’s turned into something else. Wilma picks up some clothes and starts folding.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: I don’t know what I’m doing. I never expected it would go this far.
E: MORE
C: WILMA
D: The thing is I’m good at this, Charlene. It feels nice to finally be good at something. But no team means no Olympics. It ain’t like I can make a living from running no way. Even Jesse Owens couldn’t make a living off it without racing horses and dogs for white folks like he was the animal. Wilma scoffs at the lunacy of this fact.
E: CONT'D then
C: WILMA
D: Sad part is to even get that kind of humiliation or to even get a fighting chance, you gotta be man.
E: CONT’D
C: CHARLENE
D: But men ain’t mothers. Mothers are strong, Skeeter.
C: WILMA
D: Yeah and mothers know how to sacrifice, which I haven’t been doing. Mama toted me around for years when I was sick. And it took me two days to get home to my child. Just think how I would’ve felt if that fever didn’t break. No gold medal could’ve fixed that. ‘Feeling nice’ is a luxury. I need to go back to school and focus on school. Graduate. Get a good job and take care of my baby. Wilma grabs the laundry basket and goes inside leaving Charlene at a loss. EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - DAY Ed glances at his watch as he walks toward the track. Only Eleanor is there.
E: beat
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Where is everyone?
C: ELEANOR
D: Off somewhere mad at you.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: And you’re not? Eleanor looks away, not answering.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Take a rest day, Eleanor. She walks away without making eye contact. Ed looks across at the men’s field. President Davis approaches.
E: CONT’D
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: Temple! No training today?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I gave the girls the day off.
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: And well deserved. I believe congratulations are due. The Olympics! You have done more with the Tigerbelles than me or anyone else could have ever expected. It’s difficult for Ed to take this as a compliment.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Well, thank you, Walter.
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: It pains me a little to say it, but you were right. TSU is on the lips of people all around this country.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: The girls worked really hard. You couldn’t ask for better representatives of this school.
C: PRESIDENT DAVIS
D: I know. And you’re the reason for their success. It’s because of that, that I’ve made a decision. E/I. IMPOVERISHED SCHOOL - LIBRARY - EVENING Ed stands outside of a window and gazing inside. ED’S POV: C.B. is amongst a group of VOLUNTEER LITERACY WORKERS from her church. CHILDREN sit at tables with books. C.B. is helping one of them with their reading. Ed comes inside, slowly crossing to C.B.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: It looks really good in here. I’m really proud of what you’ve done with these kids. A lot of elbow grease. There’s distance and tension in the air.
C: C.B.
D: When it’s what you’re meant to do, it doesn’t even feel like work. You know that. He nods in response. He takes a deep breath.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Can we talk? EXT. IMPOVERISHED SCHOOL - SCHOOL YARD - MOMENTS LATER C.B. leans against the Merry-Go-Round as Ed paces.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Walter offered me the men’s coaching job.
C: C.B.
D: What’d you tell him?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Given I’ve got no girls on the team left to coach, looks like the decision’s been made for me. Everybody but Eleanor quit.
C: C.B.
D: What?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: They don’t know any better. But I can’t let the girls’ squander their opportunity.
C: C.B.
D: You mean your opportunity.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: This isn’t about me, C.B.
C: C.B.
D: It’s always about you.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You just talking nonsense now.
C: C.B.
D: You’re selfish.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Me? Selfish?
C: C.B.
D: I love you, so I won’t lie. Yes. You’re so focused on getting Marvin’s job, on getting to the trials, on getting to the Olympics that you aren’t focused on seeing on those girls.
C: COACH TEMPLE I see them. C.B.
D: You know every piece of food they eat, but you didn’t even know Skeeter had a whole baby at home. He takes a deep breath. There’s truth in these words.
C: C.B.
D: You work so hard to make up for what you couldn’t get on that track years ago, that you can’t see what or who is right in front of you. Ed absorbs the hard blow. Something hits him. He takes a seat on the nearby swing.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I wanna see those girls get what I wasn’t good enough to achieve. C.B. joins him on the swing set.
C: C.B.
D: You’re good enough, Ed. You always have been. You just let pride get in the way.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: And that pride made me let you down. I preach excellence, but have given you mediocrity. You don’t deserve nothing less than the best. Ed grabs her hand, holds it lovingly.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: But when you know better, you do better, right? She nods gently stroking his hand.
E: CONT'D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: So what time do I need to be here in the morning? C.B.’s confused.
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: To teach. These kids shouldn’t have to wait until high school to learn social studies. C.B. gives him a warm kiss. They’re on track to heal.
E: CONT’D
C: C.B.
D: Thank you, Ed. Really. You’ve worked too hard to get where you are. Those girls have worked too hard. They need you and you need them. You’ve got to make this right... with everyone. C.B.’s wise words land on him. INT. WILMA’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING The house is quiet. Wilma wakes up with her Yolanda curled up close. She takes a deep whiff of her sleeping baby’s head. Wilma opens a closet. Inside are the LEG BRACES of various sizes she wore as a child. She picks up a brace and turns it over in her hands, and fingering the scuffs and scrapes. EXT. WILMA’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Wilma stares at the PARALLEL BARS her family built years ago. She walks to them. She looks over her shoulder to find Charlene watching her. They lock eyes. Wilma makes the FIGHTER FIST from their childhood. Charlene does it back. Wilma stares out into the open field ahead of her. One step in front of the other... until she picks up speed. EXT. FIELDS - SAME TIME Wilma runs slowly at first, then she melds into the green scenery behind her as she pumps her arms faster and her legs carry her away. She is revived. She was born to do this! She stops to catch her breath. She finds a familiar STATION WAGON parked up ahead. Ed sits on the hood.
E: then
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: We really got that stride evened out, didn’t we? Surprised, Wilma self-consciously pats her hair into place and straightens her clothes.
C: WILMA
D: Hey, Coach. I wasn’t expecting--
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: --I was in the mood for a drive and this is where I ended up. Wilma smiles at his excuse. They look out onto the fields.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: You know, I ran for TSU. Not as good as you girls, but I was good. I never really made my mark there, so I thought I could make it coaching. If I’m being honest, I wasn’t happy when they stuck me with the girls’ team.
E: CONT’D
C: WILMA
D: Yeah, you already told us you didn’t want us. Ed holds up his hand, he’s not finished.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Like I said, I was wrong ‘bout that. Up until this season, that’s how it felt.
C: WILMA
D: What changed?
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: I’m starting to realize that sometimes what we think we want shouts so loud that it drowns out what we are made to do. Wilma thinks over his words. She becomes fully aware of why he’s there.
C: WILMA
D: I was made to be my baby’s mother. There’s no changing that.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Listen, Skeeter, I’m not downplaying your responsibilities here. Believe me, I’m not. But you’re made to do something remarkable in this lifetime. Every time the world has tried to topple you over, your destiny sets you back upright. Don’t underestimate the importance of what you girls are doing out there on that track. I know I’m not going to. Wilma takes this in.
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: President Davis offered me the men’s coaching job. But no matter what you decide, my decision has been made. I’m taking the Tigerbelles all the way. Ed turns to leave, but can’t help himself...
E: CONT’D
C: COACH TEMPLE
D: Your hands are passing your body too low. You better get ‘em up to the hips if you plan to beat the West Germans. Wilma chuckles to herself. Ed hops in his car and drives off. EXT. DOWNTOWN NASHVILLE - DAY The BLACK LABOR DAY PARADE is in full effect. The TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY BAND break into a dance, amping up the CROWD. CHEERLEADERS flip and twirl. An ornate TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY FLOAT rolls by with Jesse and the rest of the FOOTBALL TEAM as the main event. President Davis’s also aboard waving to the Crowd. Meanwhile, a modest CONVERTIBLE carrying a PATHETIC BANNER that simply reads, TIGERBELLES, is transporting Eleanor. Yet, she’s the only Tigerbelle in attendance.
E: CONT’D
C: IN THE CROWD
D: Barbara stands with the AKAs. She can’t help but to see the TIGERBELLES FLOAT. Eleanor looks downright miserable. A few AKAs snicker about the poor sight. Suddenly, Barbara sprints for the convertible.
C: AT THE CONVERTIBLE
D: Barbara leaps into the slow creeping car. Eleanor’s shocked.
C: ELEANOR
D: What are you doing?
C: BARBARA
D: I couldn’t leave you in front of this crowd all by yourself. They expect some showmanship. Eleanor brightens and hugs her. Barbara waves to the Crowd like a beauty queen.
E: joking
C: ELEANOR
D: Well, we might as well enjoy our moment in the sun. This is as close as we’re going to get to it.
C: WILMA
D: Barbara! Eleanor! They look over into the Crowd and see Wilma waving them over. TIME CUT TO: THE END OF THE PARADE ROUTE Barbara and Eleanor make their way through the Crowd of people and floats at the end of the parade. They finally connect with Wilma.
E: O.S.
C: WILMA
D: Come help with these autographs.
C: BARBARA
D: What autographs? Wilma points to a bunch of cheering, enthusiastic YOUNG GIRLS. They’re part of C.B.’s literacy group. Ed and C.B. are amidst the kids. Eleanor and Barbara stand in awe reading the HANDWRITTEN SIGNS the Girls are holding: GO FOR GOLD! TIGERBELLES ARE
C: SWELL! GO TEAM TIGERBELLES! ELEANOR
D: Does this mean what I think it does?
C: WILMA
D: It’s the Olympics. And we gotta real chance to win. Barbara puts a loving hand on Wilma’s arm.
C: BARBARA
D: I’m sorry. We let our team down.
C: ELEANOR
D: We let you down, Skeeter.
C: BARBARA
D: We didn’t know about your baby, but that still doesn’t make what we did right. Baby or not, we had no business acting how we did.
C: WILMA
D: I shoulda let you know what was going on.
E: MORE
C: WILMA
D: Y’all supposed to be my sisters. I shoulda told you. I let y’all down too. This warms both Barbara and Eleanor’s hearts. A PACK of LITERACY GIRLS holding notebooks and pens follow C.B.
E: CONT'D
C: C.B.
D: Girls, I couldn’t keep ‘em away any longer. Barbara and Eleanor are bombarded with attention.
C: LITERACY GIRL 1
D: Is it true that y’all are the fastest runners in the world?
C: LITERACY GIRL 2
D: I wanna go to college just like y’all when I grow up. Barbara melts as she signs autographs for them.
C: BARBARA
D: You will. If you’re good enough, you can even get a scholarship! Eleanor and Wilma throw Barbara a playful glance. A Literacy Girl eagerly watches Eleanor as she signs her notebook.
C: LITERACY GIRL 3
D: What are you going to get a gold medal for?
C: ELEANOR
D: I’m running the 200 and the relay. But you can’t run a relay with only three people. She looks up and catches the eyes of Wilma and Barbara. INT. JUKE JOINT - NIGHT A LIVE BAND plays for a CROWD in their 30s and 40s. Wilma, Eleanor, and Barbara take in the cool and lively Crowd. Eleanor locks in on the risqué, bluesy LADY SINGER, dressed in a short sleeved button up, trousers, and suspenders, belting out “I Want to Walk You Home” by Fats Domino. They spot Billie holding court at a table with a slick, good- looking OLDER MAN. Billie’s stunned to see them.
E: then
C: BILLIE
D: What the... She shoos the Older Man from the table.

C: BARBARA
D: This place is cool.
C: WILMA
D: Better than Jack-and-Jill? Billie laughs at Wilma’s wisecracking.
C: WILMA
D: We need you back, Billie. We wanna go to the Olympics and we can’t win without you.
E: CONT’D
C: BILLIE
D: ‘We?’ You back? What about your baby?
C: WILMA
D: If I don’t do what I’m best at, how will she ever learn to do her best? Plus, I’ve got my family and Robert to help me.
C: BILLIE
D: Your girl’s lucky. I didn’t have a mama like you to look up to.
C: BARBARA
D: Where was she?
C: BILLIE
D: She passed away when I was little.
C: ELEANOR
D: Oh, Billie.
C: BILLIE
D: She used to work here, but she did more drinking than working. Hell, the apple don’t fall far from the tree. The Girls soak her words in, seeing her for the first time.
E: sips her whiskey
C: WILMA
D: Well, this is your chance to prove ‘em all wrong.
C: BARBARA
D: You belong in Rome with us.
C: WILMA
D: Listen, Billie, running’s in my soul. And whether you wanna own up to it or not, it’s in yours too.
C: ELEANOR
D: It’s in all of us. And my legs don’t have another four years in them. Don’t you steal this old lady’s best shot at gold. They look to Billie, hopeful.
C: BILLIE
D: Eh, okay. Wilma, Barbara, and Eleanor beam.
C: BILLIE
D: Shit, I need the exercise. My hips starting to get as big as BJ’s.
E: CONT’D
C: BARBARA
D: Never heard any complaints. Barbara chugs the rest of Billie’s drink. They all, especially Eleanor, stare in shock. Barbara sticks her tongue out at Eleanor. They can’t help but to laugh.
C: BILLIE
D: I was planning on that to be my last drink.
C: WILMA
D: We’re gonna make sure it stays that way. You may not have no mama, but you still got family.
C: ELEANOR
D: Us.
C: BARBARA
D: Always. Billie’s eyes water. The Girls put their hands one on top of the other in solidarity. The BLUES SINGER begins singing “Finger Poppin Time” by Hank Ballard. Eleanor focuses on the Singer... again. Billie clocks it and leans in to Eleanor.
C: BILLIE
D: You ain’t no old maid after all. The two stare at each other... a thorough but brief conversation plays out just between their eyes. Billie winks in support.
