N: YOUNG WILMA RUDOLPH (aka “Skeeter”), 7, and her older sister
N: YOUNG CHARLENE, 12, playfully collect laundry hanging on a
N: line. In the background is the Rudolph family home... large,
N: but slightly dilapidated wooden house/farm in the midst of
N: the swath of green land.
C:                      YOUNG WILMA
D:            Betcha can’t beat me back!

C:                      YOUNG WILMA
D:            I’m still faster than you.
D: A shirt that Wilma’s collecting skims the ground.
C:                      YOUNG CHARLENE
D:            Skeeter, you better pick them clean
D:            clothes up off the ground! Mama’ll
D:            kill you!
D: As Wilma gathers the clothes in her arms, Charlene gets a
D: mischievous glint in her eyes.
C:                      YOUNG CHARLENE (CONT’D)
C:            Mark... set... GO!
D: Charlene takes off running with a basket full of laundry.
D: Wilma chases after her, laughing the whole way. Despite her
D: small size, she’s amazingly quick.
D: Suddenly, Wilma STUMBLES and falls directly into a muddy
D: pile. The clean laundry’s filthy. Charlene sprints back.
C:                      YOUNG CHARLENE (CONT’D)
D:            Mama’s gonna lick you good.
D: She tries to help Wilma up, but her legs are rubbery.
C:                      YOUNG CHARLENE (CONT’D)
D:            C’mon, Skeeter. Stand up.
C:                      YOUNG WILMA
D:            I’m trying to.

N: Wilma looks to her big sister, then down to her immobile

D:           Mama! Mama!
D: EXT. US ROUTE 79 / INT. OLDSMOBILE - MOMENTS LATER
D: A rust-caked OLDSMOBILE speeds erratically along a country
D: road dotted with LIVESTOCK and BLACK SHARECROPPERS working
D: the fields. BLANCHE RUDOLPH, late 30s, grasps the wheel
D: tightly as she drives. Charlene sways with each jerky turn of
D: the car. Wilma lays stiff-as-a-board across her lap.
D: EXT. MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE - LATER

D:           Skeeter, you gon’ be back out there
D:           running with your brothers and
D:           sisters in no time. A doctor’s
D:           gonna fix you up like new.
D: Wilma’s not so convinced. Blanche isn’t really either, so
D: Charlene takes a stab.
C:                     YOUNG CHARLENE
D:           And guess what? He’s gonna be
D:           Colored just like you.
D: Wilma raises her eyebrows in disbelief. Blanche takes Wilma’s
D: chin in her hand, Wilma’s eyes towards hers.
C:                     BLANCHE
D:           You my little fighter, you know
D:           that? Scarlet Fever? Beat it.
D:           Double-pneumonia? Beat it. And you

S: INT. MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE - DAY
N: - Wilma’s on a cold metal table. A BLACK DOCTOR and NURSE fit
N: METAL BRACES on her legs. She winces in pain.
N: -SLAM! The heavy lid of the IRON LUNG MACHINE is shut down on
N: Wilma’s small body. She finds herself in DARKNESS.
N: -SNAP! The BLACK DOCTOR fastens the rigid BRACES below Young
N: Wilma’s knobby knees. She forces a clumsy step.
N: - Charlene and Blanche look through a window as a NURSE
N: exercises Wilma’s legs in a shallow pool.
S: EXT. WILMA’S YARD - RURAL TENNESSEE - MORNING
N: Wilma sits in a makeshift wagon while Charlene massages her
N: legs. Blanche oversees the FAMILY construction of a homemade
N: polio contraption.
N: Wilma grits through a tiresome, clunky walk along the
N: PARALLEL BARS. She glances up seeing a group of KIDS at the
N: end of the road staring with confusion. Wilma stops and
N: Blanche sees the gossiping Kids. She redirects Wilma’s
N: attention to focus on the task at hand. Charlene matches
N: Wilma step-for-step, while the whole FAMILY cheers her on at
N: the end of the bars... an official finish line.
S: EXT. WILMA’S YARD - RURAL TENNESSEE - DAY
N: Wilma toys with her cumbersome brace as she stares out at her
N: Brothers and Sisters playing basketball on the homemade dirt
N: court. Her eyes hone in on their youthful and agile legs
N: scurrying on the court.
S: EXT. WILMA’S YARD - RURAL TENNESSEE - DUSK
N: Wilma’s Family walks toward their house in the distance.
N: Charlene and Wilma remain in the distance at the parallel
N: bars. Blanche yells out from the PORCH.

D:           Wilma! Charlene! Supper time!
C:                     YOUNG CHARLENE
D:           Just a few more minutes, Mama!
D: Wilma stares at the BRACES on her legs. Mind racing.
C:                     YOUNG WILMA
D:           Take ‘em off, Charlene.
C:                     YOUNG CHARLENE

D:           Mama said I can beat whatever comes
D:           my way. Take ‘em off.
D: Hesitant, Charlene unstraps the BRACES. They hit the ground
D: with a heavy THUD. Wilma, unsteady, wills her legs to move.
D: Her face is full of pure grit and determination. She
D: stumbles, Charlene moves to steady her. Trying again, Wilma
D: takes a few wobbly steps before falling on her face.
D: This time, she holds up her hand to stop Charlene. She pulls
D: herself back to her feet, takes a shaky step, and then
D: another, and then another. Charlene breaks into a proud and
D: awe-filled grin.
D: ANGLE ON: The BRACES, sitting like discarded shells in the
D: dirt, as Wilma’s LEGS gain strength and speed in the
D: background.
D:                                               MATCH CUT TO:

D: CLOSE ON: The BRACES sit dusty on a closet shelf, as we pull
D: back to reveal WILMA, 18, pretty but serious with eyes mature
D: beyond her years. Overwhelmed, she balances her daughter,
D: YOLANDA, 1, on her hips while tossing items in a suitcase.
D: Wilma’s FAMILY OF 21 KIDS bustle about, helping her pack. ED
D: RUDOLPH, 50s, dressed in a PORTER’S UNIFORM, breezes by.

C:                     WILMA
D:           What if I can’t keep up with the

D:           Not faster than Jesse. I can’t
D:           outrun cars.
C:                     CHARLENE
D:           I bet if we put you next to Mama’s

C:                     WILMA

D: ROBERT ELDRIDGE, 18, a handsome, sweet-natured country boy
D: gets out of a battered farm PICKUP TRUCK. Wilma’s YOUNGER

N: partially completed track: it’s missing the last two turns
N: leaves it in the shape of a U.
N: As Robert’s pickup truck drives past, Ed locks eyes with
N: Wilma in the front seat. Wilma offers a shy wave. Ed sternly

D:           Let me get that for you, baby.

N: STUDENTS. Among them is the suave and preppy kid, WENDELL,
N: 19, causally leaning against a car checking out the Freshmen.

D:           Hey! You boys wanna make a couple
D:           of bucks?
D: He takes a billfold from his pocket and the Boys hurry over

C: AT ROBERT’S PICKUP TRUCK
D: Wilma has been watching all of this.
C:                     WILMA
D:           Must be nice.

D:           Them lil’ boys? You got all the

D: With a wink, he takes Wilma’s suitcase from her. Suddenly, a
D: BLARE of R&B music approaches.
D: A shiny black CADILLAC pulls up beside Wilma. A leggy, red-
D: headed vixen climbs out. This is BILLIE WHITE, 21, grown as
D: she wanna be and a tad intimidating. The OLDER-LOOKING MAN in
D: the Cadillac pulls off. All heads turn as Billie struts past
D: the Freshmen.
C:                     BILLIE
D:           What? Never seen a senior before?

D: Barbara's Father organizes the desk while Barbara’s Mother
D: places an ornate bedspread on the bed. Barbara’s not doing a

D: and Wilma exchange a glance: This girl is spoiled.

D: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - CAMPUS - AFTERNOON
D: Wilma, in a long baggy T-shirt and frumpy shorts, jogs

D: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - SAME TIME
D: Wilma and Barbara, competitors at the core, glance at each
D: other then start jogging faster and faster until finally they

D: powerful. Eleanor’s steady and calculated. Barbara’s gait is

D:           She ain’t nobody now.
C:                     WILMA
D:           What happened to her?
C:                     BILLIE
D:           She got knocked up and Coach threw
D:           her off the team.
D: Shit. Fear washes over Wilma’s face.
C:                     BILLIE (CONT’D)
D:           He sent her packing right back to
D:           whatever country hill she came
D:           from. We ain’t seen her since.
C:                     BARBARA
D:           He didn’t have to do all that.
C:                     ELEANOR
D:           His track, his rules. No mothers on
D:           the field. Kids are the ultimate
D:           distraction.
D: Barely breathing, Wilma forces a nod. Just then, Wendell
D: walks in with confidence. He stands in the middle of the
D: cafeteria and gives a distinctive ALPHA FRAT CALL with gusto.
C:                     WENDELL
C:           ROLL CALL! A-PHI-A!
D: A table full of ALPHA PHI ALPHA BROTHERS stand up. They’re
D: smartly dressed in Frat regalia of the times: Button downs,
D: trousers, oxfords, some wear bow ties.
C:                      ALPHA FRAT BROTHERS
C:           A-PHI-A!

D:           Phi-A/But they just can't compare
D:           with the black and gold!
D: They begin to STEP. The rhythm of their steps fills the
D: cafeteria. Then the rival Sigma Frat jumps in to battle.
D: Suddenly, AKA sorority start their signature ladylike moves.
D: Not to be outdone, ZETA PHI BETA Sorority begins to battle.
D: It's a magical moment. Our Tigerbelles watch in awe. Barbara,
D: in particular, is intrigued. She catches the eye of Wendell.
D: The STEPPING and CHANTS continue over:
D: MONTAGE - THE FIRST WEEKS OF SCHOOL:
D: INT. HALE HALL - WILMA’S ROOM - DAY
D: An ALARM CLOCK goes off. Wilma groggily looks over at the
D: other bed. Barbara’s asleep with an eye mask, pink rollers,
D: and a scarf over her hair. Wilma quietly slides out of bed.
D: INT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - CLASSROOM - DAY
D: Wilma in Math class, studiously taking notes.
C:                     PROFESSOR
D:           If you'll turn to page three of the
D:           reader that's being handed out...
D: The STUDENT ahead of her, sporting a TSU FOOTBALL shirt,
D: turns to hand her the readers. This is JESSE, 20. Wilma
D: almost gasps at how good looking he is.
C:                     JESSE
D:           Here you go.
D: Wilma takes a reader and smiles shyly. Jesse can’t help but
D: to take a look back over his shoulder.
D: INT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - LIBRARY - DAY
D: A stern LIBRARIAN walks Wilma through her campus job.

D:           shelving books.
D: The Librarian wheels out MOUNDS OF BOOKS. Wilma sighs.
C:                     WILMA
D:           Yes, ma’am.
D: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - CAMPUS - DAY
D: Wilma leaves the library, making her way across campus. She
D: sees a group of NURSING STUDENTS pass by. Then, TWO THEATER
D: STUDENTS recite Shakespeare. Wilma smiles to herself; being
D: at college is a dream come true.
C: END MONTAGE
D: INT. HALE HALL - PHONE BOOTH - AFTERNOON
D: Barbara’s already dressed in her practice gear. She’s propped
D: up next to the dorm PHONE BOOTH. Wilma comes in the lobby.
C:                     BARBARA
E:               (on the phone)
D:           There she is now.
E:               (off phone)
D:           Wilma! It’s your boyfriend.
D: Barbara sticks the phone in Wilma’s hand with a mischievous
D: glint in her eye.
C:                     BARBARA (CONT’D)
D:           See you at practice. Don’t be late.
D: Barbara hurries off. Wilma stares at the phone, torn.

D: EXT. CLARKSVILLE STREETS - PHONE BOOTH - SAME TIME
D: A FOR COLORED ONLY sign is firmly tacked to the phone booth.
D: Robert toys with the cord, subtly clocking looks from the
C: WHITE BYSTANDERS passing by.
C:                       WILMA
D:           Robert?
D: Robert brightens when he hears Wilma’s voice.

D:           Hey, you.
C:                     WILMA

E:               (lowers her voice)

D:           Now that’s what I’m talking about.
C:                     WILMA
D:           No, really. I gotta go change. I’ll

C:                     ROBERT
C:           Alright, I--
D: She hangs up and takes off running. Robert’s left listening
D: to the dull DIAL TONE, a little overlooked.
D: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - LATER
D: It’s 5:58. Ed taps his watch suggestively as Wilma runs up,
D: just in the nick of time. He blows his whistle.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Three lines, girls. Eleanor, run
D:           ‘em through the warm up.
D: Eleanor leads them through exercises: high knees, butt kicks,
D: lunges. Wilma and Barbara focus on each other, competing even
D: in the warm-up.

N: Wilma’s feet dig into the starting blocks. Sweat pours from
N: her face. Barbara and Billie flank her on each side. BANG!
N: They take off. Suddenly, Ed emphatically waves his arms and
N: BLOWS his whistle bringing the Girls to a halt.
N: Ed marches to Wilma and positions her back to the blocks.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           You’re not doing a hard post on
D:           your take off.
D: Wilma’s confused. She looks to Barbara and Billie. They don’t
D: have a damn clue what he’s talking about either.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           Get in your starting stance.
D: Ed stands in front of her inspecting her heel-to-toe
D: relationship. Her feet are shoulder width apart.
C:                      COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           Now post up to me to assemble the
D:           hard post.
D: Ed holds his arms out in front of Wilma, bracing for impact.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           Run into my hands like you’re
D:           taking off.
D: She does. His hands halt her shoulders mid-stride.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           Hold the stance.
D: One of Wilma’s legs stays up, holding her hard post position.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           Feel your body in that line? That
D:           there’s a triple extension. You
D:           gotta hold that hard post.
E:               (to the Tigerbelles)
D:           Your position needs to be
D:           perpendicular to the ground at a 90
D:           degree angle.
D: Eleanor takes copious notes. As Wilma strains to hold the
D: position, her butt sticks out causing her stance to falter.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           You’re broken at the waist.
E:               (to the Tigerbelles)
D:           Breaking at the waist gives you
D:           what we call a bubble butt. You
D:           don’t want that.

D: Eleanor shushes her.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           This ain’t about body type, Billie.
D:           It’s about posture.
D: Ed motions for Barbara to hold her hard post position. He
D: nods his approval. Points to Billie. She nails it.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           Always remember that if don’t get
D:           out of those blocks right, you

D:           Yes, Coach.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           And you’re lopsided. Favoring one
D:           leg. It’s breaking your stride.
D: Wilma lowers her gaze, feeling a little picked on.
C:                      COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           Follow me.
E:               (beat)

D:           Nothing you don’t know about, sir.

D:           Well, it looks like you’re still
D:           carrying it. Come here.
D: Ed digs around in his crate of EQUIPMENT. He pulls out an
D: ANKLE WEIGHT and straps it onto Wilma’s left ankle. He snakes
D: the strap around Wilma’s shoulder blades into a figure 8 and
D: then loops it under her armpits. He tightens the strap and
D: she immediately stands up straighter, but is self-conscious.

D:           And they did a good job teaching
D:           you to walk. But I’m gonna teach
D:           you to run. Until you straighten
D:           out, you’ll need to wear this 24-7.
D: He motions for her to head back to the track. Wilma tightens
D: her face to hide embarrassment. Eleanor takes notice of
D: Wilma’s dismay with Ed’s solution.
C:                     WILMA
D:           How’m I supposed to run in this?

D: INT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - GIRLS’ LOCKER ROOM - LATER
D: Billie, Eleanor, and Barbara peel off her sweaty track

D:           Keep on and you really will have a
D:           bubble butt.
D: In her underwear, Barbara monitors her svelte figure.
D: Everything is taut and in place. Wilma turns away and tucks
D: herself into a corner to hide her body. With her back to the
D: Girls, she takes off her top. A C-SECTION SCAR is present on
D: her stomach. She quickly slides on a shirt to hide it.
C:                     ELEANOR (CONT’D)

D:           Barbara can’t find out about

D:           One bite can’t hurt. I promise I

D:           today is the day I skim the cream.
D: Proven correct, Eleanor self-righteously raises her brows to
D: Billie, Barbara, and Wilma. Wilma stiffly stands wearing the
D: brace contraption, hoping this is all worth it. The
D: Tigerbelles all look at one another. Who’s it gonna be?

N: MONTAGE - SKIMMING THE PACK:
N: Ed BLOWS the whistle and the Girls run. He takes notes. As
N: Eleanor takes off with urgency...
C: A CLUNKY RUNNER
D: ...takes to the track, but her stride has no cadence and she
D: weaves in between the lines. Ed motions for her to leave the
D: track. Saddened, she does.
D: Ed lines the Girls up for another run. Barbara digs deep as
D: she hustles around the track.
C: A STIFF RUNNER
D: ...makes the turn on the track with her upper body rigid. Ed
D: blows the whistle and points for her to leave. Down goes
D: another runner.
D: The Girls line up for another run. Billie passes the others
D: with ease, looking like a winner.
C: A HEEL-HIKER
D: ...can’t avoid over-striding. It makes her foot land too far
D: in front of her knee. Ed adjust his glasses. He waves his
D: hand for her to stop running. She let’s the tears flow.
D: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - LATER
D: Another run. Wilma’s fingers press into the track, awaiting
D: Ed’s whistle. Ed BLOWS it and they’re off. He immediately
D: notices Wilma’s posture is off.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
E:               (mumbling to himself)
D:           Damnit. Just listen.
D: This faux-pas puts Billie in the lead. Barbara and Eleanor
D: are close behind. Wilma kicks into another gear to catch up.
D: Ed zeros in her, and only her.
D: -- WILMA’S LEGS running, her FEET STRIKING the track.
D: -- Ed is one with his STOPWATCH. His eyes widens as he looks
D: between his stopwatch and Wilma.
D: -- Wilma breathes rhythmically, running in stride. She passes
D: Eleanor and closes in on Barbara with cheetah like speed.
D: -- Ed stops staring at the stopwatch. Seeing something
D: special, the whistle drops from his mouth.
D: -- WILMA’S ARMS PUMPING. Her face suddenly contorts into a
D: strained look. She’s flies by Barbara.

N: Billie crosses the finish line with Wilma only inches behind
N: her. Wilma almost caught up, but failed. Ed shakes his head

D:           Best second place!
D: Wilma’s frustrated with herself as Ed addresses the Girls.

D: INT. TSU - COACH TEMPLE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
D: Ed’s makeshift office is nothing more than a desk in the
D: middle of an equipment storage shed. Wilma follows Ed.
C:                     WILMA
D:           Sir, I know what you’re gonna say.
D:           I was awful out there.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Your biggest mistake today was that
D:           you thought you knew better than
D:           me. I already told you. Bad posture
D:           cannot win.
D: Wilma tugs at the brace.
C:                     WILMA
D:           I woulda caught Billie if I ain’t
D:           have this on. It slows me down.
E:               (finally)
D:           This thing makes me feel like I’m a
D:           dang cripple.
C:                      COACH TEMPLE
D:           It’s your broken spirit that’s
D:           slowing you down. Your past doesn’t
D:           have to be a cinderblock. It
D:           doesn’t have to define you. You
D:           need to work to move past it.
E:               (beat)
D:           Did you know you were on pace for a
D:           record-setting run with the brace?

C:                      COACH TEMPLE

D: INT. TSU - JUST OUTSIDE COACH TEMPLE'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
D: Wilma scans the area, she’s alone. She pumps her fist in the
D: air and lets out a SHRIEK of joy.
D: INT. TSU - COACH TEMPLE’S OFFICE - SAME TIME
D: Ed can’t help but to smile as the excited SOUNDS of WILMA’S
D: SHRIEKING comes into his office. As the sounds die out, Ed’s
D: eyes fall on an OLD BOX sitting behind his desk. His worried
D: look shows that this box haunts him.
D: He slowly approaches the box. He exhales as he opens it. It’s
D: full of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, MEDAL RIBBONS, and OLD RACE
D: NUMBER RUNNING BIBS. He rifles through each item.
D: INSERT: A headline reads: MARVIN JOHNSON, TENNESSEE STATE
D: UNIVERSITY TRACK AND FOOTBALL STAR SWEEPS HBCU NATIONALS.
D: Ed scans the write up.
D: INSERT: ED’S NAME is toward the bottom. He’s listed as an
D: ALSO RAN. The PHOTO shows Marvin Johnson crossing the finish
D: line with Ed far off in the background, forgotten.

S: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - LATER
N: Ed walks toward the infield where COACH MARVIN JOHNSON, 38,
N: YELLS from the sidelines at the FOOTBALL TEAM. Dressed in his
N: pristine TSU sweatsuit, it’s clear his BMOC (Big Man on
N: Campus) status never died.
N: But Ed has his gaze and step locked in on the man chit
N: chatting with Marvin Johnson... Tennessee State University’s
N: President, WALTER DAVIS, 60. Just as Ed is about to speak to
N: Davis... CLACK!!! Both Ed and Davis’ attention is drawn to
N: the clashing of shoulder pads from the massive HIT on the
N: field. Jesse (Wilma’s classmate) has made the impressive
N: tackle. Marvin proudly looks on.
C:                     MARVIN
D:           Know you not used to it, but that’s
D:           the sound of winning, Temple.
D: He nudges Ed in fun and belts out an annoying laugh. Jesus,
D: Ed can’t stand this guy and we can see why. He tries to be
D: the bigger man.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Team’s looking good, Marvin.

D: Ed moves closer to Walter.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Walter, a word?
D: Davis tries to contain his irritation. Ed has a history of
D: pestering him. They move away from Marvin.
C:                     PRESIDENT DAVIS
D:           Sure, Ed. What is it?

D:           Yes, I’m sure that’ll be, uh, very
D:           exciting time.
C:                      COACH TEMPLE

C:                     PRESIDENT DAVIS
D:           Marvin’s already our men’s coach.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           I know, but Marvin’s never brought
D:           you a title. I can do that with
D:           these girls.
D: Ed has Davis’ ear; he adds to his pitch.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           And when I do, it’s worth thinking
D:           about a restructure. If I could get
D:           my hands on the men’s team, I could
D:           really make a mark for the school.
D: Davis considers it and dangles a carrot.

D:           Let’s see what you can do in
D:           Tuskegee first and then we’ll talk.

N: Billie looks to Eleanor for backup, but she’s wandered off to
N: a STOIC and PROPER COUPLE. They give a tight and polite wave
N: to Eleanor. These devout church goers are Eleanor’s parents.
C:                     WILMA
D:           I’ll be back for warmups.
D: As Wilma runs over to her family, Billie can’t help but to
D: notice she has no family in attendance. Her eyes dart from
D: Barbara, to Eleanor, and finally to Wilma. All surrounded by
D: their blood. Billie quickly refocuses her attention the
D: ALABAMA STATE TRACK ASSISTANT COACH who’s smiling at her.
D: Billie switches toward the young coach. Meanwhile, Wilma
D: gathers with her family.
C:                     WILMA (CONT’D)
D:           What y’all doing here?
D: Charlene points to Barbara’s Family fawning over Barbara
D: doing her best poses. They’re celebrating absolutely nothing.
C:                     CHARLENE
D:           That... but much better.

C:                     BLANCHE
D:           I told Mrs. Roberts I’d come in
D:           tomorrow. Wasn’t no way I was
D:           missing my college girl’s big day!
D: Wilma takes in her Family staring at her... expectations
D: high. She takes a deep breath.
D: Ed spots President Davis in the CROWD making small talk. Ed
D: gets serious, feeling stakes of his own.
D: MONTAGE - TUSKEGEE TRACK MEET:
D: ATHLETES from Tuskegee University, Alabama State, Prairie
D: View A&M, and Florida A&M mill about.
D: -- Line up for the 100. Wilma and Barbara get in the blocks.
D: Wilma fidgets. The RUNNER next to her gives a tough gaze.
C:                     TUSKEGEE RUNNER
D:           Shoulda spent more time training
D:           and less on your hair.
D: The GUN FIRES! Wilma wins easily. Barbara struggles for
D: SECOND PLACE. She looks to her family, downcast.
D: -- Line up for the 200: Barbara, Billie, and Wilma walk to
D: their lanes and shake out their muscles. Eleanor looks at the
D: Tigerbelles and then at Ed. He’s glowering.

D:           No bubble, Skeeter! Longer strides,
D:           Billie! Barbara, focus! Eleanor,

D: -- The race ends with Billie placing first, Wilma second, and

D: glances up at President Davis, who claps, very pleased.
D: -- The 4x100 relay: The Tigerbelles huddle.
C:                     ELEANOR
D:           Okay, the Tuskegee lead off is fast
D:           off the blocks, so nail the first

D: shade in warm-ups.

D:           Let’s see what your hair looks like
D:           when I whoop your ass.
D: BANG! Billie takes off with spring in her step and passes the
D: baton to Eleanor. Eleanor runs hard then passes perfectly to
D: Barbara. Barbara catches her Family CHEERING from the corner
D: of her eye and turns on the gas. The handoff with Barbara and
D: Wilma is not clean! Ed cringes at this error, but Wilma
D: easily cruises with her long strides. She takes FIRST PLACE!
C:                     BILLIE (CONT’D)
D:           That's how it’s done! Everybody
D:           better get hep!
D: Each of the Tigerbelles celebrate separately with their
D: families and clicks. To his dismay, Ed witnesses this.
D: President Davis CLAPS with fervor and beckons Ed over.

D: The FANS suddenly stop their chatter. The other TEAMS whisper

D: Ed lugs his bags from Tuskegee inside. Then, he spots his
D: portly mother-in-law, MAMA GRACE, 60, on the couch
D: crocheting. She delivers a judgmental glance over the top of
D: her glasses as he walks in the door.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Oh! Hi, Mama Grace. I wasn't
D:           expecting you here. Where's C.B.?
C:                     MAMA GRACE
D:           She had her literacy program
D:           meeting at the church. She waited
D:           and waited on you, and then had to
D:           call me to watch the kids.
D: Shit, he forgot. Mama Grace seems to take some joy from this.
D: HEADLIGHTS shine through the window as the sound of TIRES on
D: GRAVEL invade the house. C.B. comes in the front door. She
D: looks at Ed, visibly annoyed.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           C.B., I'm sorry, sweetie. I tried
D:           to make it back in time, but I had
D:           some moves to make and fast.
D:           Eleanor showed me something that--
C:                     C.B.
D:           --That could’ve waited. You know I
D:           have commitments and
D:           responsibilities too.
C:                     MAMA GRACE
D:           To the Lord!
D: Both C.B. and Ed throw Mama Grace a glance.

D: C.B. and Ed turn to one another... not exactly their choice.
D: INT. COACH TEMPLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
D: The bedroom is well-kept with his and hers beds. It’s
D: functionally decorated with practical mid-century decor. Ed
D: walks in and looks at C.B. in bed, reading a CHURCH PAMPHLET
C: about her LITERACY PROGRAM.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Good you’re still awake. Something
D:           I need to show you.
D: He pulls out the Sports Illustrated Magazine. A WHITE TRACK
D: TEAM from Texas is on the cover. C.B. raises a brow.
C:                     C.B.
D:           Women runners on the cover? That's
D:           good for you. For next year at
D:           least.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Look at page eighteen.
D: She turns the page and now we REVEAL...
D: INSERT: CHART OF RUNNING TIMES. The Tigerbelles’ TIMES are
D: written on it by Eleanor for comparison.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           They got the cover with those
D:           times. Their time in the one
D:           hundred is point five below our
D:           slowest runner. Point seven in the
D:           two hundred.
D: C.B. closely examines the page.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           And look at the relay. These Texas
D:           girls aren’t the best runners in
D:           country. My girls are.

C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           I need to put ‘em up against a

C:                     C.B.

D:           Beating each other at practice only

C:           together, C.B.
E:               (beat)
D:           To beat them white girls, they need
D:           an ‘us against the world’
D:           mentality. And they can’t be an
D:           ‘us’ if they’re focused on ‘I.’
D: C.B. nods in agreement as she sits up in bed.
C:                     C.B.
D:           Is President Davis on board with

D:           the girls run up against grown men?
D: His silence is a resounding no, but to clarify:
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           High school boys, not men.
C:                     C.B.

C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           There’ll be hurdles, but I can
D:           clear them. Baby, if we win in New
D:           York there’s no way Walter can keep

D: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - EVENING
D: Wilma trains alone on the track. Determined, she’s wearing
D: the brace Ed gave her. Jesse and his TEAMMATES pack up their
D: gear at the end of football practice. Jesse lingers behind
D: his Teammates to watch Wilma run. She's natural and
D: beautiful. He walks toward her and she slows down to a trot.
C:                     JESSE

C:                     JESSE
D:           It’s just another piece of

D:           before running, right?
D: Ed can’t argue with his own rules.
C:                     WILMA (CONT’D)
D:           Jesse’s helping me study. He can’t
D:           come in the dorms and the library
D:           just closed.
D: Even though they can’t hear the conversation, Barbara,
D: Billie, and Eleanor watch the drama unfold FROM THE DORM
D: WINDOW. They might as well have popcorn.
C:                     WILMA (CONT’D)
D:           That’s why I missed curfew. Am I
D:           off the team?
D: Jesse waits with baited breath.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Goodnight, Jesse.
D: Cue noted. Jesse carefully places several more books into
D: Wilma’s arms before leaving.
D: FROM THE DORM WINDOW: Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor stay
D: focused on Ed and Wilma. He’s very animated. They turn to one
D: another with a knowing look... this can’t be good.
D: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - DAY
D: Ed BLOWS THE WHISTLE to end practice. The Tigerbelles are
D: sweat-soaked and worn.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Not sure what happened, but y’all
D:           really pushed yourselves today.
D:           Good job.

C:                      COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           Since you both like to be running
D:           all around town after curfew, maybe
D:           you’ll like running a few more laps
D:           around the track. Fifteen laps.
E:               (then)
D:           Eleanor, stay and keep their tally.

C:                     COACH TEMPLE

D:           What kinda practice is this?
C:                     BILLIE

D:           Now I don’t mean no harm, but what

D: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - TRACK - LATER
D: 4x200: Winded, Billie PANTS as she runs full speed at the
D: TURN. Her head slightly turns to either side. She’s actually
D: being matched by the HIGH SCHOOL RUNNER and the HBCU RUNNER!
D: Billie is shocked as hell. Ed watches, astounded.
D: Pouring with sweat, Billie pushes harder and harder to find
D: herself LAST. Eleanor anxiously awaits the baton.
C:                     ELEANOR
D:           Hurry up, Billie!
D: Billie finally sticks the handoff. Eleanor concentrates as
D: she breathes RHYTHMICALLY to count her step count. In the
D: turn, her habitual syncopated cadence is thrown off. She
D: can’t turn her burners on. Barbara sighs heavily as she
D: watches Eleanor’s squinted face approach.
C:                     BARBARA
D:           Dig it out, Eleanor!
D: Handoff complete. Barbara’s usual slick glide is enough to
D: catch the HBCU RUNNER, but she’s a step away from the HIGH
C: SCHOOL RUNNER.
D: Wilma keeps her eyes locked forward as Barbara approaches.
D: She holds out her hand. Flat. Palm upwards... waiting to
D: accept. As Barbara goes to deliver the baton with a single
D: swift deliberate smack, they bobble the handoff AGAIN!
C:                     BARBARA (CONT’D)
D:           Damnit!
D: They try to stick it again, but go outside of their

D: EXT. TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY - KEAN HALL - NIGHT
D: The smooth, low rumble of a BARITONE SAX BLOWS while a TRIO
D: OF FEMALES SINGERS snap their fingers to the beat. The R&B
D: MUSIC from the LIVE BAND weaves through the elegantly dressed
D: COLLEGE COUPLES dancing. Hanging sign read: HOMECOMING 1959.
C: AT A PHOTO BACKDROP
D: Wilma and Robert pose for formal portraits. Robert’s suit is
D: a little ill-fitting and unstylish. It’s definitely more of a
D: hand-me-down Sunday suit than a formal one.
D: Barbara and Wendell sit with Eleanor. Naturally, Barbara’s
D: decked out fabulously. Eleanor has done little to transform
D: her look. She still clings to her infamous notebook.

D:           Hey, Billie. Looking good.

D:           --Don’t!
C:                     ROBERT
D:           Oh, that’s right. He don’t know.
C:                     WILMA
D:           Please, Robert. Not here.
C:                     ROBERT
D:           Why don’t you please stop telling
D:           me lies?
C:                     WILMA
D:           I’m not lying to you.
D: Robert isn’t convinced.
C:                     JESSE
D:           Go on home, Robert.
D: When Jesse puts his hand on Wilma’s shoulder, a rage sets
D: across Robert’s face.
C:                     ROBERT
D:           Stay away from my girl!
D: Robert PUNCHES Jesse. The Tigerbelles SCREAM as Jesse hits
D: the floor.
C:                      WILMA
D:           Robert!
D: Jesse collects himself and begins to return the punches. A
D: couple of his FOOTBALL TEAMMATES run over. Wendell and his
D: FRAT BROTHERS rush in to shut this down... they hold back
D: Jesse and his Teammates from Robert.
D: Wilma looks mortified, Barbara and Eleanor are appalled, but
D: Billie is smugly satisfied.
C:                     ELEANOR
D:           This isn’t funny, Billie.
C:                     BILLIE
D:           Oh, I know it ain’t.
D: Wilma looks over at Billie who makes sure to speak loud
D: enough for Wilma to hear.
C:                     BILLIE (CONT’D)
D:           Neither was running all night.

N: Billie’s very pointed with this and Wilma can do nothing, but
N: run out of the room.
C:                      ELEANOR
D:           That was Coach’s call, Billie. Not
D:           Skeeter’s.
D: There’s truth in this and Billie knows it. Pride still bigger
D: than reasoning, Billie shrugs her shoulders and walks off.
D: EXT. PARKING LOT - ROBERT’S PICKUP TRUCK - LATER THAT NIGHT
D: Solemn, Wilma and Robert lean against his truck.
C:                     WILMA
D:           You embarrassed me.
C:                     ROBERT
D:           Embarrassed you? You had me in
D:           there looking like a plum fool!
C:                     WILMA
D:           I told you Jesse’s just a friend.
C:                     ROBERT
D:           I don’t need no college degree to
C:           know what I saw.
D: Robert hops in his truck.
C:                     WILMA
D:           Don’t leave.
D: Robert doesn’t bother to respond. He speeds off leaving Wilma
D: alone in the parking lot.
D: EXT. COACH TEMPLE’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
D: The Tigerbelles load their suitcases into the back of Coach
D: Temple’s station wagon. Ed kneels down in front of Edwina and
D: Lloyd. C.B. stands behind them.
C:                     EDWINA
D:           Will you bring us gifts from New
D:           York, Daddy?
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Depends if y’all are gonna be good
D:           for your mama.
C:                      EDWINA
D:           We will!
D: He gives each of the them a kiss goodbye. When Ed goes to hug
D: C.B., she hands him a box full of BAGGED LUNCHES. Clearly,
D: there won’t be any hugs coming his way. He peers over his
D: shoulder to make sure The Tigerbelles can’t hear.

D:            If I could stay to support your
C:            little event, I would.
D: She’s taken aback by his phrasing.
C:                      C.B.
D:            ‘Little event?’
C:                      COACH TEMPLE
D:            You know what I mean, C.B.
C:                      C.B.
D:            I’m beginning to see that.
D: He checks again to make sure they aren’t being overhead.
C:                      COACH TEMPLE
C:            Baby, I apologized.
C:                      C.B.
D:            You can’t take your team giving
D:            excuses, but you’re quick to give
D:            ‘em yourself, aren’t you?
D: C.B. takes out a few bagged lunches from the box. She puts on
D: a smile and goes over to join The Tigerbelles at the car. She
D: hands each girl a paper bag.
C:                      C.B. (CONT’D)
D:            Lunch bag for the trip, ladies.
D:            Coach wants to limit the stops.
D: Wilma and Billie peer into the paper bag.
D: THEIR POV: There’s a SANDWICH wrapped in wax paper, an APPLE,
D: a COOKIE, and an EMPTY MASON JAR. Wilma and Billie sneak a
D: look at each other in confusion about the empty jar.
C:            WILMA                        BILLIE
D: Thank you, ma'am.            Thanks, Mrs. Temple.
D: Barbara and Eleanor give C.B. a warm smile of appreciation.
C:                      C.B.
D:            You're welcome, girls. But if you
D:            wanna thank me, y’all do your best.
D:            And I know your best is nothing
D:            short of winning.

N: The Tigerbelles beam at C.B.’s support. Ed uses this warm
N: moment as a nice segue into stealing a kiss goodbye. C.B.
N: returns it, but it’s not the warmest moment.
C:                     C.B. (CONT’D)
D:           Be careful, Ed.
D: He watches her put her arms around Edwina and Lloyd. Nearby,
D: Jesse jogs up with his bag. He tosses it in the car. Wilma
D: pulls Jesse to the side for privacy.
C:                     WILMA
D:           Jesse, I’m sorry about what
D:           happened at the dance.
C:                     JESSE
D:           It wasn’t your fault. Beautiful
D:           girls make men do crazy things.
D:           Don’t you worry about it. Barely a

D:           Now let’s get on the road.
D: EXT. NASHVILLE / INT. COACH TEMPLE’S STATION WAGON - DAY
D: Jesse drives while Ed sits shotgun, going over paperwork.
D: Wilma gazes out the window.
D: HER POV: The car passes MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE, where she
D: was treated as a child. An OLDER WOMAN with polio comes out
D: on crutches with the aid of a NURSE.
D: Wilma adjusts the brace that Ed makes her wear... a constant
D: reminder of how her childhood struggles are still with her.
D: I/E. COACH TEMPLE’S STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON
D: They’re deep in countryside now. Jesse flips on the radio.
D: "Baby You've Got What it Takes" by Brook Benton and Dinah
D: Washington. Barbara wiggles uncomfortably in her seat.
C:                     BARBARA
D:           Um... Coach? I need to stop.
C:                     BILLIE
D:           For what? You can't be hungry, you
D:           already ate your sandwich.

D:           Philadelphia.
D: Wilma watches Barbara continue to squirm in her seat.
C:                     WILMA
D:           Well, how far away is that?
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           I don't know. 300 miles or so.
C:                     BARBARA
D:           Coach, I cannot wait that long. I
D:           need to use the ladies’ room now.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           If you have to do your business, do
D:           your business.
D: The Girls are confused. Wilma fishes around her lunch sack
D: and pulls out her empty jar.
C:                     WILMA
E:               (realizing)
D:           Uh...
D: The Tigerbelles looks vary from disgust to disbelief.
C:                     BARBARA
D:           What? I'm not peeing in no jar.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Well, we're not stopping so figure
D:           it out. When I was a runner back in
D:           the day, we used jars when we
D:           traveled. There's a modesty sheet
D:           behind you if you need it.
D: They check the space behind them to see a FOLDED SHEET.
C:                     ELEANOR
D:           Coach, these are young ladies here.
C:                     BARBARA
D:           I will not, I cannot... pee in a
D:           jar.
C:                     JESSE
D:           Coach, it's fine. I can pull over.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           No, you can't. We're a car of
D:           Negroes driving through Virginia.
D:           I don't want any run-ins.

E:               (holds up a Green Book)
D:           Yes, of course I have it! There

D:           Like I said, if you need to do your

D:           Sir, she’s right. The equipment and
D:           mechanics is a little different
D:           from men.
C:                     BILLIE
D:           How would you know?
C:                     BARBARA
E:               (indignantly)
D:           If I tell my Daddy that you took us
D:           on an eight hundred mile road trip
D:           and wouldn't pull over so that we
D:           could relieve ourselves with the
D:           tiniest bit of dignity, that you
D:           had us use mason jars while two men
D:           sat within arms reach in the front
D:           seat... he will blow his top. And
D:           you do not want my Daddy to blow
D:           his top.
D: EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER
D: The Station Wagon pulls over to a wooded area near a dirt
D: driveway that leads down to a property. The Tigerbelles climb
D: out, a little triumphant. Jesse glances after them, Ed throws
D: him the modesty sheet to cover his eyes.
D: WITH THE GIRLS IN THE BUSHES
D: They stride hurriedly into the bushes to pee. Barbara is
D: especially vexed and struggling with her fussy coat and purse
D: to hurry and relieve herself.
C:                     WILMA
D:           BJ, why did you bring your

C:                     BARBARA
D:           I know. Suggesting we pee in a jar?
C:                     WILMA
D:           And he was serious.
C:                     ELEANOR
D:           The idea of treating us no
D:           differently than male athletes
D:           certainly has its limitations.
D: They all squat down to pee.
D: BACK WITH ED AND JESSE
D: They stretch their legs outside of the station wagon. A
D: POLICE CAR approaches. Ed motions to Jesse.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Pretend like you checking the tire.
D: Jesse does as told. A WHITE OFFICER looks out of his window,
D: taking in the scene as he drives slowly. Jesse fiddles with
D: the tire. Ed holds his breath. But the Officer doesn’t stop,
D: he drives off. Ed and Jesse exhale in relief. Then...
C: A FARM TRUCK
D: ...toting a FARM DOG pulls up onto the property. It slows
D: upon seeing Ed and Jesse. They tense up. The Tigerbelles
D: emerge from the bushes jovial and buoyant. The DOG begins to
C: BARK wildly.
D: The driver’s door opens slowly... a SHOTGUN BARREL appears
D: through the crack. The door swings open to reveal a pimple-
D: faced WHITE BOY, 14, dressed in too-large overalls. The gun’s
D: so heavy it’s awkward in his arms.
C:                     WHITE BOY
D:           What the hell y’all doin’ on my
D:           property?

D:           Young man, sir, I'm sorry. We
D:           didn't realize. We meant no
D:           disrespect, sir.

D: The White Boy, with his gun clumsily and dangerously aimed at
D: the group, steps closer to the station wagon.
C:                     WHITE BOY
D:           I reckon that’s a good idea.

D:           I meant a walk, sir. There are some
D:           important historical landmarks
D:           nearby. And we are students first.
D: Ed is grumpy, but it’s hard to argue with her logic.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Okay, but be back in three hours.
D:           Jesse, you’re bunking with me.
E:               (to the Girls)
D:           Don't make me regret giving you
D:           some slack.
C:                     BILLIE
D:           Come on, Eleanor. Introduce us to
D:           this ‘Apollo’ fella.
D: Before Eleanor has a chance to protest, Billie and Barbara
D: hook her arm and whisk her away. Only Jesse and Wilma remain.
C:                     JESSE
D:           I was thinking I'd find a bite to
D:           eat. Wanna join me?
D: EXT. HARLEM - STRIVER’S ROW - LATER THAT NIGHT
D: The LIGHTS sparkle. Romantic. Idyllic. Wilma and Jesse walk.
C:                     WILMA
D:           My mama told me I could take on
D:           anything in the whole world. Didn’t
D:           ever think it’d take me here.
D: Jesse takes this in.
C:                     JESSE
D:           Sounds like a wise woman.
D: Wilma’s mind wanders...
C:                     WILMA
D:           I was a really sick child.
C:                     JESSE
E:               (somewhat certain)
D:           Polio?
C:                      WILMA
D:           Yeah. Doctors said I’d never walk
D:           again. My mother said I would.
E:               (beat)
D:           I believed my mother.

N: Jesse looks at her anew; taking her in with awe.
C:                     JESSE
D:           Never supposed to walk and now here
D:           you are... a college track star.
D:           Well, you've certainly made a
D:           recovery. In every way.
D: He sweetly compliments her figure. Wilma blushes and
D: deflects, embarrassed by the attention.
C:                     WILMA
D:           Well, what's your story?
C:                     JESSE
D:           My people are from North Carolina.
D:           It's just me and my older brother
D:           as far as kids go. He sorta fell
D:           into the family business. Farming.
D:           He didn't finish high school and I
D:           decided I didn't want that life. I
D:           knew that college was gonna be the
D:           only way to get outta there.
C:                     WILMA
D:           So, was it football that brought
C:           you to TSU?
C:                      JESSE
D:           Yep. I’m trying to go pro.
E:               (beat)
D:           So, uh, after all this, you’re just
D:           gonna go right back home? To
D:           Robert?
C:                     WILMA
D:           Not back to him,   but my family. I
D:           mean, where else   am I supposed to
D:           go? I wish there   was something like
D:           football for us,   but there’s not.
D:           So, I’ll go back   home and teach.
C:                     JESSE
D:           You’ve faced so many limitations in
D:           life, why limit your dreams?
C:                     WILMA
D:           I ain’t think I was. Being a
D:           teacher is dreaming too low?
C:                     JESSE
D:           Not at all. Thinking track has to
D:           stop at graduation is.

D: Jesse folds his arms, disagreeing.
C:                     JESSE
D:           You built it up to an A-.

N: Damn, he’s too sweet. Wilma meets his eyes. Jesse takes her
N: hand. Wilma’s hesitant as hell, her uncertain eyes meeting
N: Jesse’s as he takes a step closer to her. The romantic energy
N: is palpable. He leans in and the romantic moment overtakes
N: Wilma’s initial resistance. They kiss with the lights of the
N: big city twinkling all around them.
N: E/I. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - MORNING
N: CIRCUS TRUCKS pack up outside with ANIMALS, JUGGLERS,
N: ACROBATS, CARNIES, the whole nine yards. Ed leads The
N: Tigerbelles past the spectacle.
N: Ahead of them lies the track. In the middle of the field are
N: a sea of WHITE TRACK TEAMS warming up. Bodies buzz around in
N: every direction. The Tigerbelles take in the scope of the
N: event. The stakes could not be more visual: They are the only
N: Black runners here.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Ok, girls. We have everything to
D:           prove today. Doing well here will
D:           change how TSU thinks about women’s
D:           track. That means better equipment,

D:           We have to prove that we have the

D:           through the warm up.
D: Ed gets in the TEAM CHECK-IN LINE. It’s long and

N: does some small talk.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           I thought this meet would be a
D:           little more organized. I mean, when
D:           a circus prevents you from a proper
D:           warm up.
D: Coach Abernathy finally looks at Ed. He doesn’t seem to be
D: impressed, rather Abernathy’s amused.
C:                     COACH ABERNATHY
E:               (matter of fact)
D:           You’re out of your element, boy.
D: Ed eyes Coach Abernathy from head to toe. Ed isn’t impressed
D: by him either.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           The name is Temple. See you on the
D:           track... Abernathy.
D: Abernathy’s surprised by this and takes a sudden interest in
D: Ed, watching him closely as he walks away.
C: A FEW YARDS AWAY
D: The Tigerbelles begin to unload near the TEXAS TRACK TEAM.
D: Barbara leans toward Wilma, Billie, and Eleanor.
C:                     BARBARA
E:               (whispers)
D:           Look. It's them. The ‘cover girls.’
D: The Texas Team stare at The Tigerbelles who stare back...
D: each sizing each other up. We recognize JANICE, the Sports
D: Illustrated cover girl; a tall, immaculately groomed blonde.
C:                      WILMA
D:           How can they run with their hair
D:           that high?
C:                     BILLIE
D:           A foot tall bee hive, but no ‘bee-
D:           hinds.’
D: Eleanor stares at them as they warm-up. They’ve got a
D: military-like precision to their training.
C:                     ELEANOR
D:           Maybe it’ll slow them down.

D:           Eleanor’s two weeks away from being
D:           asked to join the Mother Board.
D: Meanwhile, Janice whispers to her own Team. They glance over
D: to The Tigerbelles and laugh, talking shit of their own.
C:                     BILLIE (CONT’D)
D:           You got something to say to me?
D: Ed walks up, flipping through paperwork.

D:           If we struggle and lose to these
D:           white girls...
D: Wilma, Barbara, Billie, and Eleanor know the stakes. It
D: weighs heavily on them. Ed squats down, making sure all eyes
D: are on them.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Blacks folks have struggle tattooed

D: Eleanor, confused, scans her notebook.
C:                     ELEANOR
D:           Why is she in lane seven? Her times

D: Encouraged, the Tigerbelles nod in agreement.
D: ON THE TRACK - MINUTES LATER
D: Janice is in lane five, the best lane, shaking herself loose.
D: Billie passes directly over her blocks to mess with her.
D: Janice tries to seem unfazed.
D: THE STARTER readies himself on the sidelines. All RUNNERS
D: settle themselves into the blocks.
C:                     BILLIE
D:           Hey, Blondie.
D: Janice slightly looks over at Billie.
C:                     BILLIE (CONT’D)
D:           You're in my lane.
D: BAM! The Starter FIRES the starting pistol. Janice falters
D: getting out of the blocks. Billie’s off like a dart. The
D: other Runners struggle to keep stride with her. Billie
D: crosses the finish line FIRST and with panache.
D: The Tigerbelles all CHEER. Ed remains stoic.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Barbara, you're up next!

D:           Hey, show this city what you got.
D: Barbara nods   and struts her way up to her starting block.
D: BAM! Barbara   WINS her heat without once even looking at her
D: competition.   As she crosses the finish line, her eyes are
D: caught up in   all of the SPECTATORS in the stands.
D: Coach Abernathy YELLS at his Team. He glares at Ed, not happy
D: about how his team is doing. Ed pulls Wilma aside.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)

D:           Mr. Temple, I'm going to need to

C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Why's that?
C:                     OFFICIAL
D:           We need to ensure that your spikes

D:           Alright, then. Cleats off, girls,
D:           so we can get back to work.
D: Ed hands the cleats over to the Official, never taking his
D: eyes off Abernathy. The Tigerbelles stand huddled together,
D: feeling very small in this large arena.
C:                     ELEANOR
D:           They're just trying to throw us off
D:           our game.

D:           And y’all are too, for damn sure.

D: They put on their cleats and line up for their relay.
D: Eleanor is the lead off. Barbara’s 2nd, Billie’s 3rd and
D: Wilma’s the anchor.
D: Wilma looks into the Crowd, slightly nervous. Jesse catches
D: her eye, and motions for her to peacock. She does a few large

D: watch. She is ready.
C: AT THE STARTING BLOCK
D: Eleanor takes her place at the starting block. BAM! The
D: pistol fires.
D: ELEANOR takes off, neck and neck with the Texans. There’s a

D: keeps pace with the Texans and passes to Billie who...
D: SLIPS as she takes off. Not a huge fall but enough of a
D: stumble to lose ground to the Texans, who begin to gain. She
D: hands the baton to Wilma, who is now behind.
D: ED watches Wilma as she digs deep, and makes up all the
D: ground that Billie just lost. Through pure determination, she
D: crosses the line FIRST!!! It's an amazing performance. An

N: MONTAGE - JUNK YARD TRAINING UNDER A DRUM LINE BEAT:
N: -- The Girls struggle to push the car. Half of the wheels are
N: flat and barely turn.
N: -- The Girls are out of sync in their pushing of the car.
N: Frustrated, they BARK OUT instructions at one another.
N: -- The car begins to move more quickly. The Girls now more in
N: step with one another, but now the car needs steering.
N: -- Ed recruits a SKINNY MARCHING BAND MEMBER from a LINEUP of
N: STUDENTS that range from a RAIL-THIN WOODWIND PLAYER to a
C: GIGANTIC TUBA PLAYER.
D: -- The Skinny Marching Band Member steers the clunker as the
D: Tigerbelles pull it around the track.
D: -- More MARCHING BAND MEMBERS are inside the car as the Girls
D: continue to pull it around the track.
D: POV FROM INSIDE THE CAR: The Marching Band Members excitedly
D: check out the Girls’ butts as they pull the clunker around
D: the track. Billie turns around, catching them. She hikes her
D: shorts up a little higher to really give them a show.
D: -- President Davis watches skeptically from the sidelines.
D: -- Ed brings over the GIGANTIC TUBA PLAYER.
C:                     BARBARA
D:           Oh no, I'm not pushing Tubby.
C:                     WILMA
D:           C’mon, y’all. Let's just do it.
D: -- The Tigerbelles pull the packed car, complete with the
D: Tuba Player. It's slow going. A CROWD, including Jesse, have
D: gathered to watch. The Tuba Player plays his instrument out
D: the top of the car; the SLOW TOOTS match the pace of the car
D: being pulled.
D: -- As the car gains speed, Ed sends more BAND MEMBERS to jump
D: on the car. The Tigerbelles continue to gain speed as TUBA
D: BEAT QUICKENS. They complete their lap! They jump on the hood
D: as the CROWD CHEERS them on.
D: Ed’s proud, but tries to hide it. President Davis approaches
D: with intense heat.
C:                     PRESIDENT DAVIS
D:           Ed, this training... it’s just not
D:           appropriate for young ladies!

D:           Exactly. And that’s why I need to

D: Ed stares at his watch, waiting as Barbara, Billie, and

D:           Yes. The Italians have been
D:           following Olympic hopefuls from
D:           around the world very closely. ‘La

D: Eleanor swallows hard with her teammates’ eyes on her.
C:                     ELEANOR
D:           The curlers, yes. But I didn’t know
D:           Billie and BJ were going to throw
D:           the race.

D:           You might not be in their game,
D:           Eleanor, but you’re on the

D:           most of Nashville.
C:                     WILMA
D:           And that sweat shoulda took us on
D:           to victory, but you let it drown us

D:           who doesn’t even know me? For so-
D:           called teammates to stab me in the
D:           back? I call myself doing what I

D:           We’re all helping Mama with the
D:           laundry anyway.

D:           Skeeter, what you doing with this

D:           be good at something. But no team
D:           means no Olympics.
E:               (then)
D:           It ain’t like I can make a living
D:           from running no way. Even Jesse

D: Wilma scoffs at the lunacy of this fact.
C:                     WILMA (CONT’D)
D:           Sad part is to even get that kind

C:                     CHARLENE
D:           But men ain’t mothers. Mothers are
D:           strong, Skeeter.
C:                      WILMA
D:           Yeah and mothers know how to
D:           sacrifice, which I haven’t been
D:           doing. Mama toted me around for
D:           years when I was sick. And it took
D:           me two days to get home to my
D:           child. Just think how I would’ve

D:           Well, thank you, Walter.
C:                     PRESIDENT DAVIS
D:           It pains me a little to say it, but

D:           of people all around this country.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           The girls worked really hard. You

D:           I know. And you’re the reason for

D: Wilma stares out into the open field ahead of her. One step
D: in front of the other... until she picks up speed.
D: EXT. FIELDS - SAME TIME
D: Wilma runs slowly at first, then she melds into the green
D: scenery behind her as she pumps her arms faster and her legs
D: carry her away. She is revived. She was born to do this!
D: She stops to catch her breath. She finds a familiar STATION
D: WAGON parked up ahead. Ed sits on the hood.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           We really got that stride evened
D:           out, didn’t we?
D: Surprised, Wilma self-consciously pats her hair into place
D: and straightens her clothes.
C:                     WILMA
D:           Hey, Coach. I wasn’t expecting--

D:           --I was in the mood for a drive and
D:           this is where I ended up.
D: Wilma smiles at his excuse. They look out onto the fields.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE (CONT’D)
D:           You know, I ran for TSU. Not as
D:           good as you girls, but I was good.
D:           I never really made my mark there,
D:           so I thought I could make it
D:           coaching. If I’m being honest, I
D:           wasn’t happy when they stuck me
D:           with the girls’ team.
C:                     WILMA
D:           Yeah, you already told us you
D:           didn’t want us.
D: Ed holds up his hand, he’s not finished.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Like I said, I was wrong ‘bout
D:           that. Up until this season, that’s
D:           how it felt.
C:                     WILMA
D:           What changed?
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           I’m starting to realize that
D:           sometimes what we think we want
D:           shouts so loud that it drowns out
D:           what we are made to do.
D: Wilma thinks over his words. She becomes fully aware of why
D: he’s there.
C:                     WILMA
D:           I was made to be my baby’s mother.
D:           There’s no changing that.
C:                     COACH TEMPLE
D:           Listen, Skeeter, I’m not
D:           downplaying your responsibilities
D:           here. Believe me, I’m not. But
D:           you’re made to do something
D:           remarkable in this lifetime. Every
D:           time the world has tried to topple
D:           you over, your destiny sets you
D:           back upright. Don’t underestimate
D:           the importance of what you girls
D:           are doing out there on that track.
D:           I know I’m not going to.
D: Wilma takes this in.

D: EXT. DOWNTOWN NASHVILLE - DAY
D: The BLACK LABOR DAY PARADE is in full effect. The TENNESSEE

D: An ornate TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY FLOAT rolls by with
D: Jesse and the rest of the FOOTBALL TEAM as the main event.
D: President Davis’s also aboard waving to the Crowd.
D: Meanwhile, a modest CONVERTIBLE carrying a PATHETIC BANNER
D: that simply reads, TIGERBELLES, is transporting Eleanor. Yet,
D: she’s the only Tigerbelle in attendance.
C: IN THE CROWD
D: Barbara stands with the AKAs. She can’t help but to see the
D: TIGERBELLES FLOAT. Eleanor looks downright miserable. A few
D: AKAs snicker about the poor sight. Suddenly, Barbara sprints
D: for the convertible.
C: AT THE CONVERTIBLE
D: Barbara leaps into the slow creeping car. Eleanor’s shocked.
C:                     ELEANOR

E:               (joking)
D:           They expect some showmanship.

D: Wilma points to a bunch of cheering, enthusiastic YOUNG
D: GIRLS. They’re part of C.B.’s literacy group. Ed and C.B. are

D: Eleanor and Barbara stand in awe reading the HANDWRITTEN

D:           We let you down, Skeeter.
C:                     BARBARA
D:           We didn’t know about your baby, but
D:           that still doesn’t make what we did
D:           right. Baby or not, we had no
D:           business acting how we did.

E:               (then)

D:           lead by Wilma Rudolph. This is one
D:           of the three events she is running
D:           at this Olympics. She stands a good
D:           chance to set an Olympic record by
D:           taking gold in all three.
D: Ed tightly holds his notebook in his hands. He’s got some

D:              Barbara Jones will not advance,
