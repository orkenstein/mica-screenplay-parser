S: EXT. AERIAL - ESTABLISHING
0: 
N: A bird's eye view: A VILLAGE set in a clearing in the middle
N: of impenetrable forest that stretches as far as we can see.
0: 
N: We move closer, gaining details-- the surrounding patchwork
N: of farmland. The high wooden fence, stark and foreboding.
0: 
N: And into the town itself. Spare, spartan. Rows of simple
N: houses leading into a central marketplace and the innermost
N: hub-- the church. Like the nucleus of a cell.
0: 
N: A tiny microcosm of civilization forged through sheer force
N: of will out of unforgiving, untamed wilderness.
0: 
N: In this world, heat and light come from fire. Water comes
N: from a well. Food comes from the ground and the forest. And
N: survival is a gift from God.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. TOWN - SUNRISE
0: 
N: We float, disembodied, through the empty town toward the
N: church. It looms over us, ominous and imposing. A
N: puritanical, frontier vibe.
0: 
N: We come to a stop in front of the church, at the town's
N: centerpiece:
0: 
N: A giant leafless TREE made out of twisted metal. Where a
N: WOMAN stands on a platform with a noose around her neck.
0: 
N: She stands silent and still in a heavy shroud. Her head
N: bowed. Neck bent unnaturally. Long hair hanging down,
N: obscuring her face.
0: 
N: We move closer... closer...
0: 
N: And now we see-- BLOOD dripping from the Woman's hands.
N: Dropping into puddles on the ground on either side of her.

S: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
0: 
N: TIERNEY JAMES (16) jolts awake, gasping for breath. Her
N: night dress damp with sweat. Her plaited hair in disarray.

C:                          PENNY
D:               Tierney?

0: 
0: 
N: Tierney looks across the homespun quilt to her two younger
N: sisters sharing the bed-- CLARA (14) and PENNY (12)-- both
N: in identical night dresses and white-ribboned braids,
N: sharing the same look of concern.
0: 
C:                          CLARA
D:              Are you alright? Was it...
E:                    (low, scandalous)
D:              A dream?
0: 
C:                          PENNY
D:              Maybe your magic is coming in!
0: 
N: Tierney tenses. Shivers. Magic... But she shakes it off.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              It was nothing. I'm fine.
0: 
N: She slides out of bed, feet on the bare wooden floor. Pulls
N: on her dress, starts to do up the buttons-- but her sisters
N: are staring. Did she miss a button?
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              ...What?
0: 
N: Penny and Clara giggle.
0: 
C:                          PENNY
D:              Did you forget?
0: 
C:                          CLARA
D:              Because Aunt Linny didn't.
0: 
N: (O.S.) A door SLAMS. A sharp VOICE echos in.
0: 
C:                          AUNT LINNY (O.S.)
D:              Oh Giiiiiiirrrrrrls!

S: INT. SEWING ROOM - DAY
0: 
N: CORSET STRINGS tighten against Tierney's back as Clara YANKS
N: them with all her might. Tierney sucks in her breath,
N: holding onto the sewing table for support.
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY
D:              Ow...
0: 
N: Penny SCRUBS Tierney's calloused feet. We see the scar of a
N: BRAND on the sole of one foot: three slashes in a rectangle.
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              Careful--
0: 0:                                                              4.
0: 
0: 
N: AUNT LINNY (severe and ruthless) DIGS the dirt out from
N: under Tierney's fingernails with a file.
0: 
C:                             TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:                 Hey!
0: 
C:                             AUNT LINNY
D:                 It's your own fault. Running wild
D:                 like a dog...
0: 
N: Aunt Linny picks up a deep-blue raw-silk dress with river-
N: clam pearls along the neckline.
0: 
C:                             AUNT LINNY (cont'd)
D:                 Come on. Arms up.
0: 
N: Tierney looks at the dress the way a convict eyes a noose.
N: But she obediently raises her arms overhead...
0: 
0: 
N: MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: Aunt Linny surveys her handiwork. She just looks resigned, as
N: if this is the latest in a long series of disappointments.
0: 
C:                             AUNT LINNY
D:                 It will have to do. One last thing.
0: 
N: She goes to the sewing box for A LONG, RED RIBBON.
0: 
N: Vibrant. Daring. Almost vulgar compared to the girls' muted
N: and modest clothing. A color of danger and sin and blood.
0: 
N: Aunt Linny gently undoes the white ribbon from Tierney's
N: braid and lets it fall to the floor. She takes her time
N: tying the red ribbon in its place. A rite of passage.
0: 
N: And as she works, we may notice-- half of her thumb is
N: missing. An old, ugly wound.
0: 
C:                             AUNT LINNY (cont'd)
D:                 Today, my dear, you leave childhood
D:                 behind. Today you become a woman.
0: 
N: Penny leans in to Clara.
0: 
C:                             PENNY
D:                 She looks like a stuffed turkey.
0: 
N: Tierney studies herself in a full-length mirror. Pink
N: cheeks, freshly scrubbed. Dark hair, perfectly coiffed. Pale
N: skin, offset by the deep blue of the dress. Heaving chest,
N: constricted by the corset.
0: 0:                                                              5.
0: 
0: 
N: A reflection she doesn't recognize. She frowns, not sure
N: what to make of this stranger in the mirror.
0: 
C:                          ABE (O.S.)
D:              My little Tierney. Look at you.
0: 
N: The girls straighten up as-- their FATHER (ABE) walks in. He
N: has a kind face, a strong frame, and a twinkle in his eye.
N: He carries a heavy medical bag and a weary expression.
0: 
N: Aunt Linny stands to the side. Eyes downcast, deferential.
N: Penny and Clara sit with their legs tucked under them and
N: their hands in their laps, prim and obedient.
0: 
C:                          AUNT LINNY
D:              I did my best. Even if a veil is out
D:              of the question...
E:                    (sighs)
D:              She'll at least look the part.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I don't need a veil. There's nothing
D:              wrong with the labor houses.
0: 
C:                          AUNT LINNY
D:              Working your fingers to the bone,
D:              struggling for scraps, sharing a room
D:              with ten other girls...
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
E:                    (sharp)
D:              Better than being someone's wife.
0: 
N: It's like the air goes out of the room. Everyone freezes.
N: Aunt Linny looks like she's been slapped.
0: 
C:                          AUNT LINNY
D:              How dare you show such disrespect--?
0: 
N: But Abe waves it off. He gives Tierney a wink.
0: 
C:                          ABE
D:              Tierney's right. There is no shame in
D:              hard work. The dairy and the mill are
D:              both entirely respectable. And she's
D:              always been a free spirit.
0: 
N: Aunt Linny just huffs.
0: 
C:                          AUNT LINNY
D:              And you've indulged her. Far be it
D:              for me to tell you how to raise your
D:              daughters, Abe, but--
0: 0:                                                              6.
0: 
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Can I go now?
0: 
C:                            ABE / AUNT LINNY
D:              Yes. / No.
0: 
N: Tierney can't leave fast enough. But as she reaches the door:
0: 
C:                          ABE
D:              And while you're out, pick up some
D:              berries from the market.
0: 
N: Tierney stops short. Penny and Clara giggle.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Like this?! But-- it's Veiling Day!
D:              Everyone will be there!
0: 
N: Abe holds Tierney's gaze. Aunt Linny gives a slight smirk,
N: as if she's won some battle.
0: 
C:                          ABE
D:              That's the point. And Tierney, today
D:              of all days-- mind your dress.
0: 
0: 
N: ON TIERNEY
0: 
N: Storming out of the sewing room as Aunt Linny's voice echoes:
0: 
C:                          AUNT LINNY (O.S.)
D:              Alright, girls-- morning scriptures.
0: 
N: Striding through the modest house-- past stockings drying on
N: the mantle... a basket full of unfinished knitting... herbs
N: hanging in the windowsill...
0: 
N: She grabs a cloak and bursts out the front door--
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: --toward the market and the looming steeple of the church.
0: 
N: She passes women hanging laundry... Men loading a wagon...
N: Little boys playing with sticks... Little girls cuddling
N: corncob dolls. She feels all their eyes on her--
0: 
N: Her exposed chest and collarbone. Her bare calves and knees.
N: The bright red ribbon in her hair.
0: 
N: Tierney wraps the cloak around her, hiding her body. She
N: quickens her pace, hurrying toward the crowded--
0: 0:                                                           7.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. MARKET - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: The heart of the town: a maze of open air stalls, and a
N: cacophony of people. Bartering and gossiping. Hurrying
N: through a list of chores.
0: 
N: And now we notice-- so many women in this town are
N: DISFIGURED in different ways. A faded scar... A hobbled
N: walk... A patch over one eye... A missing ear...
0: 
N: They all walk with stooped shoulders, bowed heads, eyes
N: downcast. And they're all modestly dressed in muted colors,
N: their hair braided back. With a few exceptions:
0: 
N: We spot other red ribbons in the crowd. Teenage girls freshly
N: primped in fancy dresses, escorted about like show cattle.
N: The flashes of skin, vibrant colors, and adornments feel
N: daring and extravagant, and even lewd.
0: 
N: Tierney is so busy people watching that she forgets her own
N: discomfort and lets her cloak fall open as she goes to the
N: fruit stall to fetch a basket of berries.
0: 
C:                          BEHIND HER
D:              My, my, Tierney.
0: 
N: Tierney turns to see KIERSTEN (16), a porcelain beauty in a
N: silk dress with strands of gold woven in her hair. Her full
N: lips are as red as her ribbon. Her eyes are cold and cruel.
0: 
N: She stands with two other girls, JENNA and JESSICA, planets
N: orbiting the sun.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              So you do have a figure under there.
D:              Who ever would have guessed? Pity it
D:              will only go to waste.
0: 
N: Jessica and Jenna giggle. Tierney can feel her cheeks flush.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              If you see Michael, say hello for me.
0: 
N: And with that, Kiersten and her sycophants move on. Tierney
N: trades a few coins for a basket of berries as the FRUIT
N: VENDOR grins at her chest. He was clearly eavesdropping.
0: 
C:                          FRUIT VENDOR
D:              I'd give you a veil and then some.
0: 
N: Tierney just grits her teeth. She starts to turn away when--
0: 0:                                                              8.
0: 
0: 
N: A DOG growls at her feet. Scrawny and dirty and heavily
N: muzzled. An animal that's had meanness beaten into it. And
N: the Young Man holding the leash is TOMMY PEARSON.
0: 
C:                              TOMMY
D:                Nice dress.
0: 
N: Tommy reaches out and runs a finger over the the tiny pearls
N: near Tierney's collarbone. Enjoying her rage when she SMACKS
N: his hand away.
0: 
C:                            TIERNEY
D:                Touch me again, you'll lose a finger.
0: 
C:                            TOMMY
D:                Such a temper for a lady. Someone
D:                needs to teach you the manners your
D:                father never could.
0: 
N: Tierney goes to smack him again, but people are watching. So
N: she reigns in her temper, smooths her dress, glares.
0: 
N: He leans in. Invading her space. Close enough to whisper:
0: 
C:                            TOMMY (cont'd)
D:                I've got a new muzzle that needs
D:                breaking in and a veil to match. And
D:                I don't care who your mother was.
0: 
N: That's enough. Tierney's eyes flash. She pushes past him--
0: 
N: The crowded market no longer feels like a place she can
N: hide. Everyone seems to be looking at her. Women frowning.
N: Children whispering. Old men leering. Young boys laughing.
0: 
N: She hurries away... through narrow alleys and back
N: streets... until she reaches
0: 
0: 
N: AN OLD MILL.
0: 
N: Abandoned and falling apart. Singed and charred from some
N: long-ago fire. Nothing but farmers' fields beyond it and--
N: in the distance-- the high wooden FENCE that separates the
N: town from the surrounding forest.
0: 
N: Tierney looks around to make sure no one is watching...
0: 
0: 
S: INT. MILL - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: Tierney slips inside--
0: 0:                                                              9.
0: 
0: 
N: All shadows and cobwebs and broken bits of machinery. The
N: floorboards groan and creak beneath her feet. And suddenly--
0: 
N: A FIGURE grabs her from behind! Tierney WHIRLS around--
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
E:                    (furious)
D:              Michael!
0: 
N: MICHAEL-- 16, grins at her, teasing. But when he takes in
N: the full sight of her, all dressed up, his eyes go wide.
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              Wow. You look--
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Don't. Start.
0: 
N: Tierney sets down her berries and makes her way to a rotting
N: ladder. She climbs up to a--
0: 
0: 
N: LOFT - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: A musty, cramped space made cozy with rugs and cushions and
N: candles and a bolt of tattered cloth covering the broken
N: window. A secret hideaway.
0: 
N: Michael pulls aside a rug to reveal-- a crude checkerboard
N: pattern carved into the floor.
0: 
N: Tierney pulls up a loose floorboard to retrieve a small box
N: with little trinkets inside: a thimble, a spool, a button,
N: a bullet etc.
0: 
N: They position the trinkets on the board and we realize--
N: they're GAME PIECES.
0: 
N: Michael moves his first piece on the board. Tierney moves
N: next. Soon they're both deep in concentration...
0: 
N: Or are they? Michael keeps stealing glances at her.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Stop it.
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              What?
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              You're looking at me.
0: 0:                                                             10.
0: 
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              You're... hard not to look at. Like
D:              that.
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY
D:              You should see some of the other
D:              girls.
E:                     (smirks)
D:              Kiersten sends her regards. She says
D:              she looks forward to bringing you
D:              many sons.
0: 
C:                           MICHAEL
D:              Not funny.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I'm sure your Fathers already have
D:              names picked out.
0: 
N: Tierney moves a piece, removing one of Michael's. Michael
N: studies the board, his expression inscrutable.
0: 
C:                           MICHAEL
D:              And what about you? What does your

C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Actually, that might depend on you.
0: 
N: Michael pauses. He was about to make a move, but now his
N: hand freezes on a game piece...
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              What do you mean?
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I was thinking, if I make it back
D:              from the Grace Year--
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              When you make it back.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              --I want to tend the fields. And I
D:              was hoping you could ask your Father
D:              to pull some strings for me.
0: 
N: Michael's paralysis breaks. He captures one of Tierney's
N: pieces and swats it aside, surprisingly hostile.
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              The fields? That's the lowest work
D:              available.
E:                          (MORE)

0: 
C:                           MICHAEL (cont'd)
D:              You'd be alone, open to the elements,
D:              with no protection. And so close to
D:              the forest--
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I can take care of myself.
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              Against a ghost?!
E:                    (before she can reply)
D:              The point is-- You deserve a real
D:              home. A real life.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Where my every thought and action can
D:              be dictated by my husband's whims?
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              Maybe, with the right husband--
0: 
N: But Tierney shoots him a look.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              No man in his right mind will ever
D:              take me for a wife. I am stained with
D:              my mother's sins. And even if I
D:              wasn't... You know how I feel.
0: 
N: Michael sits quietly. Thinking. He knows.
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              Is this because of... you know. Your
D:              dreams?
0: 
N: Tierney tenses. This is dangerous territory.
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL (cont'd)
D:              Have you had any more?
0: 
N: Tierney makes another move on the game board. Evasive.
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY
D:              I told you, I'm done with all that. I
D:              just...
E:                    (from her soul)
D:              I want to be able to stare up at the
D:              sky anytime I want. And feel the sun
D:              on my back. And dig my fingers into
D:              the earth. And help things grow. I
D:              want to feel useful and untethered
D:              and... Free.

C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              Please. Say you'll do this for me.
0: 
N: Michael looks at her. Serious, sincere.

C:                          MICHAEL
D:              I would do anything for you...

N: He wants to say more, but-- the CHURCH BELL begins to clang.
N: Michael and Tierney trade a look. Their time is up.

0: 
N: ON TIERNEY AND MICHAEL
0: 
N: Walking back to the center of town. Tierney clutching the
N: basket of berries in her arms.

C:                          MICHAEL
D:              I can't believe I'm not going to see

0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              You'll be so busy you won't even
D:              notice. What with training for the
D:              Council, and preparing your new home
D:              for your future bride...
0: 
N: Michael looks around, ensuring they're alone.

C:                          MICHAEL
D:              What do you think it'll be like?
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Hmm. I'm imagining lots of lace. And
D:              Kiersten seems partial to blue...

C:                          MICHAEL
D:              No-- you know... The Grace Year.

E:                    (feigning horror)
D:              Michael Welk! You know we don't speak
D:              of such things!
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              Come on. How long do you think it
D:              takes for your magic to come in?
0: 
N: Tierney tenses. He's struck a nerve.

0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              Do you think it will happen to all
D:              the girls at once? Like with your...
0: 
N: She shoves him, but it's half-hearted. Her mind is suddenly
N: elsewhere...
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL (cont'd)
D:              I wonder how it will manifest. I
D:              overheard my mother and her sister
D:              once. Something about reading minds...
0: 
N: Tierney's gaze is up ahead. Sound falls away as she fixates
N: on the monstrosity in the center of town square:
0: 
N: THE PUNISHMENT TREE.
0: 
N: The very tree we saw the Woman hanging from in our opening.
0: 
N: Its twisted metal branches adorned with BODY PARTS. Fingers.
N: Toes. Ears. Braids of hair. Hanging like ornaments.
0: 
N: Tierney stares at it-- transfixed. Remembering her dream.
0: 
C:                            MICHAEL (cont'd)
D:              Tierney...?
0: 
N: Tierney snaps out of it. She looks down to see--
0: 
N: Her hands are stained bright red. Just like the Woman in her
N: dream.
0: 
N: It takes her a moment to realize-- it's the berries. She was
N: squeezing them. And now her dress is stained as well.
0: 
N: Up ahead, women and girls are filing into the church. And
N: here comes Aunt Linny, looking frantic.
0: 
C:                          AUNT LINNY
D:              There you are! What were you-- Your

C:                          MICHAEL
D:              Hey. Whatever happens... It's going
D:              to be okay. I promise.
0: 
N: And now Aunt Linny is dragging her toward the church.

S: INT. CHURCH - DAY
0: 
N: All the women and girls of the town mill about the church.
N: Knitting. Laughing. Gossiping. Complimenting dresses and
N: admiring babies and comparing the length of their braids.
0: 
N: Tierney stands among them, but apart. Alone in a crowd. When
N: people look at her it's with pity or judgment, never a smile.
0: 
N: She watches Kiersten, Jenna, and Jessica approach an awkward
N: girl keeping to herself near the back wall. GERTRUDE.
0: 
N: Kiersten toys with Gertrude's sleeve.
0: 
C:                           KIERSTEN
D:              Such fine detail with the lace. And
D:              the gloves are a nice touch, aren't
D:              they, girls?
0: 
N: Right on cue, Jessica and Jenna move in. Mocking her.
0: 
C:                          JESSICA
D:              As if everyone's forgotten what
D:              they're covering.
0: 
C:                          JENNA
D:              Poor thing thinks she actually has a
D:              chance. But who would want to marry
D:              Dirty Gertie?
0: 
N: Gertrude flushes. Cornered. Desperate to escape...
0: 
N: Tierney looks away. Not her problem. And then--
0: 
N: A middle-aged woman comes rushing down from the bell tower.
0: 
C:                          WOMAN
D:              The veils are coming!
0: 
N: The women and girls rush to take their seats in the
N: congregation. Tierney and the other red-ribboned girls form
N: a line in the front of the church.
0: 
N: A woman in the front pew stands, reading from a Bible as--
0: 
C:                          BIBLE READER
D:              "An excellent wife, who can find? For
D:              her worth is far above jewels..."

N: The doors OPEN...

0: 
0: 
N: And KIERSTEN'S FATHER steps inside with a delicate veil in
N: his hands. He walks up the aisle and places the veil on
N: Kiersten's head like he is crowning a queen.
0: 
N: Kiersten smiles angelically. The first veil. An honor.
0: 
C:                          BIBLE READER (cont'd)
D:              "Her husband trusts his heart in her."

D:              "She does him good and not evil all
D:              the days of her life..."
0: 
N: Tierney TUNES OUT the bible reader, watching the other
N: girls. They light up with joy and relief as their fathers
N: approach. Some cry. Some squeal. One girl almost faints.
0: 
N: Eight veils given... Nine... Only five left to go. The other
N: girls in line are getting restless. Nervous.
0: 
N: Murmurs of surprise ripple through the crowd as Gertrude's
N: Father approaches with a veil. Gertrude looks STUNNED as he
N: places it on her head. And some of the girls near her look
N: like they'd like to rip it off.
0: 
N: Tierney's eyes wander over the other girls. Faces twisted in
N: anger and jealousy. Tears streaming, dreams dashed, hearts
N: broken. But she's so busy watching that she doesn't see--
0: 
C:                           ABE
D:              Tierney...
0: 
N: Tierney looks. She blinks. There must be some mistake...
0: 
N: Her Father is standing before her holding a veil.
0: 
N: Before she can react, he places the veil on her head,
N: lowering the lace over her face...
0: 
N: Like she's looking through the bars of a cage.
0: 
C:                          ABE (PRE-LAP)

S: INT. TIERNEY'S HOME - NIGHT
0: 
N: Tierney confronts her Father in the privacy of their home,
N: where she can actually speak her mind.
0: 
N: But Tierney is seeing red. Wild with fury. Pacing the floor.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Who is it? Tommy Pearson? He's cruel
D:              and stupid and arrogant! Did you even
D:              try to stand up for me? Did Michael?
0: 
N: Her sisters watch her fury from the stairs. Abe grimaces.
0: 
C:                          ABE
D:              There were plenty of protests all
D:              around, believe me. But your suitor's
D:              mind was set.
0: 
N: And now Tierney stops. She meets her Father's gaze. And it's
N: not just fury in her eyes-- it's pain. It feels like her
N: Father betrayed her.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              How could you do this to me?
0: 
C:                          ABE
D:              I just want what's best for you. You
D:              have to believe that.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              What about what I want?

N: Abe reaches out to touch her, to comfort her-- but Tierney
N: smacks his hand away.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              Don't touch me!

S: INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

0: 
0: 
N: She can see his shadow under the door crack. Lingering. As
N: if he wants to come in, but doesn't dare.
0: 
N: Then the heavy footsteps recede. And yet-- the SHADOW
N: remains. What's this?
0: 
N: Tierney creeps out of bed and opens the door to see--
0: 
N: His MEDICAL BAG. He left it here for her. An invitation.

S: INT. STUDY - MOMENT LATER

0: 
C:                          ABE
D:              If I knew, I would tell you. I swear
D:              it. But no man is privy to that
D:              sacred rite. And your mother never...
0: 
N: But he trails off, unable to continue.
0: 
N: Tierney looks up sharply at the mention of her mother. A
N: subject they rarely speak of. But since he brought it up...
0: 
N: There's another question weighing on her. One she's never
N: dared to voice before.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Was she really harboring her magic?

N: answer.

E:                    (beat)
D:              And we can discuss it further when
D:              you're back where you belong.
0: 
N: But Tierney's voice trembles as she reveals her true fear:
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              But what if the same thing happens to
D:              me? What if-- I return from the Grace
D:              Year... and my magic hasn't run out?
0: 
N: At that, Abe softens.
0: 
C:                          ABE
D:              You just make sure you return at all.
D:              Whatever it takes, you hear me?
D:              Everything I taught you-- use it. And
D:              we'll sort the rest out together.

N: Tierney nods. Though she's not exactly reassured.
0: 
C:                          ABE (cont'd)
D:              Now. The bag.

N: Tierney opens the medical bag. She reaches in... and removes
N: a glass vial. She pulls out the cork, gives a small sniff.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Camphor. Distilled from the bark of
D:              the tree. Applied topically to
D:              relieve pain and itching. Inhaled to
D:              reduce a cough.
0: 
N: Abe grunts his approval. Tierney reaches in for another

D:              If the ghosts get you, will you come

D:              The ghosts stay in the forest. Their
D:              magic binds them to the place where
D:              they died. Everyone knows that.

C:                          TIERNEY
D:              But I will make a point to haunt you
D:              personally if you touch my things.

N: Clara rolls her eyes, but Penny looks nervous as--
0: 
N: The bedroom door opens, and in comes Abe, carrying a tray
N: laden with enough food for the entire family.
0: 
N: He sets the tray on the bed. Penny and Clara eagerly reach--
0: 
C:                          ABE
D:              This is for Tierney. All of it.
0: 
N: Tierney dutifully begins to eat as she pulls on her clothes.
N: No finery today-- thick wool stockings, heavy leather boots,
N: a cotton chemise and linen smock. Traveling clothes.
0: 
N: She slips a biscuit to Penny and Clara as--
0: 
N: Abe presents her with a hand-crafted HEAVY CLOAK.
0: 
C:                          ABE (cont'd)
D:              And so is this. It was your mother's.
D:              Warm enough for winter, and you can
D:              take off the sleeves for a vest come
D:              spring. Just-- mind the lining.
0: 
N: Tierney pulls it on, ignoring him.
0: 
C:                          ABE (cont'd)
D:              Tierney.

D:              Spring. The lining. I heard you.
0: 
N: Tierney hugs the coat tightly around her. Her mother's...
N: This really means something to her.
0: 
N: Outside, the church bell CLANGS. Tierney freezes. But Abe
N: picks up her veil.
0: 
C:                          ABE
D:              Come on, then. It's time.

S: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY
0: 
N: The church bell keeps CLANGING as Tierney and the other
N: thirty-three girls stand in a line. Thirteen in veils. All
N: with red ribbons in their hair.
0: 
N: Tierney stands between Kiersten and Gertrude.
0: 
N: The rest of the town gathers to watch the ceremony. When the
N: bell stops, all eyes turn to the church. The doors open...
0: 
N: A DRUM begins to beat. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. And the first of
N: this year's eligible men exits the church:
0: 
N: GEEZER FALLOW. A stooped old man in mourning attire, though
N: he doesn't even try to hide his smile as he makes his way to
N: the square to claim a new bride.
0: 
N: Tierney tenses. Is it just her imagination, or is Geezer
N: Fallow smiling at her?
0: 
N: BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. Geezer Fallow gets closer... Oh god. He's
N: heading right for her. His smile widens as he stops--
0: 
N: --in front of Gertrude.
0: 
N: Murmurs of surprise ripple through the crowd. Gertrude looks
N: stunned and horrified as he lifts her veil.
0: 
N: BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The next boy arrives, nervous and sweaty.
0: 
N: BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. More boys follow. Lifting veils. Claiming
N: their brides...
0: 
N: BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. Here comes Tommy Pearson. He catches her
N: eye and smiles cruelly. Heading right for her.
0: 
N: BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. Tierney looks out into the crowd-- to her
N: Father. Silently pleading with him: Do something!!
0: 
N: BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. Tommy Pearson comes to a stop--
0: 
N: --in front of Kiersten.
0: 
N: Murmurs ripple through the crowd. Kiersten GASPS-- shocked,
N: confused-- as Tommy lifts her veil.
0: 
N: Tierney frowns. Not understanding what she's seeing...
0: 
N: BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. And then a pair of freshly shined boots
N: stop in front of her. Fingers lift the veil--
0: 
N: And it's Michael standing before her.

D:              Michael? What are you doing?
0: 
N: Next to her, Tommy Pearson is pawing all over Kiersten.
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              You didn't really think I'd let you

0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              Father... will come around. But it
D:              doesn't matter. This is my choice.
E:                    (he takes her hands)
D:              You must know. You have to know. I've
D:              wanted to tell you for so long.
D:              Tierney-- I love you.
0: 
N: Up ahead, Mr. Welk raises his hands to the crowd. We
N: recognize him; the man who sentenced Tierney's mother to
N: die. Everyone quiets, attentive.
0: 
C:                          MR. WELK
D:              The original sin was Eve's. The
D:              Serpent preyed upon her vanity, her
D:              curiosity, her ambition. He tricked
D:              her, and cursed her with the gift of
D:              power. A dark magic that seduced Adam
D:              and brought about the downfall of all
D:              mankind. A curse that is passed down
D:              to every member of the female sex as
D:              they come into their womanhood.
0: 
N: Tierney quietly pleads with Michael...
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Please. You're my best friend. But I
D:              don't...
0: 
C:                          MR. WELK
D:              The power to turn a man's head. To
D:              prey on man's weakness. To inspire
D:              lust and incite jealousy. To sow
D:              chaos and discord. To destroy
D:              families and from within and tear
D:              entire communities apart.
D:              Such wickedness is an affront to the
D:              Lord. And it is coursing through your
D:              blood. Threatening to destroy us all.

0: 
N: Tierney is frantic. Desperate. How to get through to him...?
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I will never be the wife you need--

C:                          MICHAEL
D:              I don't want a wife. I want you. Just
D:              as you are. That's all I've ever
D:              wanted.
0: 
N: He leans in and kisses Tierney's cheek. And whispers:
0: 
C:                           MICHAEL (cont'd)
D:              You can keep your dreams. But I dream
D:              only of you.
0: 
C:                          MR. WELK
D:              But there is hope. With faith, and
D:              perseverance, and penitence you can
D:              renounce the magic inside of you. You
D:              can cast the darkness out and be born
D:              anew. Righteous, humble, meek and
D:              mild. Ready to serve the Lord.
0: 
N: Up ahead, the gates LURCH open, revealing the impenetrable
N: forest beyond. The crowd murmurs with mounting excitement.
0: 
C:                          MR. WELK (cont'd)
D:              And so, as Eve was banished from the
D:              Garden, now must we cast you out. Go
D:              with grace, and know that our hearts
D:              go with you. Burn through your magic
D:              and return to us as purified women.
D:              Or do not return to us at all.
0: 
N: Michael, Tommy Pearson, and the other boys step back. For
N: just a moment, Tierney locks eyes with Kiersten-- her face
N: seething with silent hatred. But then--
0: 
N: Guards approach, flanking them, and the girls begin to walk.
0: 
N: Tierney keeps her eyes on her family for as long as she
N: can... Then she stares up at the high, pointed walls of the
N: fence... And then she sees--
0: 
N: Last year's Grace Year girls returning.
0: 
N: They stagger past slowly, single-file. Bone weary,
N: emaciated, reeking with rot and disease. Their eyes glazed
N: over. Hair matted, haphazardly shorn, red ribbons in
N: tatters. Some with egregious wounds-- a dislocated shoulder,
N: a festering wound, missing teeth.
0: 0:                                                          23.
0: 
0: 
N: Up ahead, one of the girls in Tierney's line breaks ranks.
0: 
C:                          GIRL
D:              Lisbeth? Sister, is that you?
0: 
N: She reaches out, but the returning girl turns her head,
N: exposing a blood-crusted scab where her ear used to be, and
N: just keeps walking. Oblivious.
0: 
N: Another girl GRABS Tierney as she staggers past--
0: 
C:                          STAGGERING GIRL
D:              The ghosts are watching... Don't
D:              stray from the path--
0: 
N: But the girl behind her shoves her forward.
0: 
N: Family members rush to greet the other returning girls.
N: Hugging them, examining them, fussing over them. Shouts of
N: joy, cries of relief. Until--
0: 
N: A frantic mother's voice rises over the commotion:
0: 
C:                          FRANTIC MOTHER
D:              Ada...? Ada...?! Where is Ada?!
0: 
N: The last of the returning girls passes Tierney, and behind
N: her-- a Guard marches solemnly with half a dozen RED RIBBONS
N: draped across his arm. Like the medals of fallen war heroes.
0: 
N: The tenor of the crowd changes. Shouts of anguish, wails of
N: grief. Tierney shivers. The danger of the forest is suddenly
N: all too real...
0: 
N: OOF! Kiersten YANKS Tierney's braid from behind, snapping
N: her head back. She leans in, whispering in Tierney's ear--
0: 
C:                             KIERSTEN
D:              You're dead.
0: 
N: Then she strides past, making her way to the head of the
N: line. Jessica and Jenna follow, SHOVING Tierney as they pass.
0: 
N: Tierney rubs her neck. Staring up at the trees whose
N: branches snake overhead. Wondering what awaits her...
0: 
0: 
S: INT. FOREST - DAY
0: 
N: The girls march. Single-file. Guards ahead of them and a
N: wagon full of supplies behind. Following a narrow, worn path
N: through the trees.
0: 0:                                                             24.
0: 
0: 
N: The sounds of the forest echo around them. Branches reach
N: for them like gnarled claws. And every now and then, they
N: pass signs of violence--
0: 
N: Blood smeared against a tree trunk...
0: 
N: A bird pecking at a severed finger discarded on the path...
0: 
N: A bird pecking at something just off the path. Curious,
N: Tierney takes a few steps off the path into the brush--
0: 
N: The bird flies off, revealing-- A SEVERED FINGER.
0: 
N: Just then-- BRANCHES SNAP in the brush just ahead. Something
N: watching her?
0: 
N: Tierney HURRIES back to her place in line.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
0: 
N: The girls huddle around a fire as the guards prowl around
N: them in an uneasy perimeter. Already a hierarchy is forming--
0: 
N: Kiersten, Jenna, and Jessica hold court around the flames.
N: The other veiled girls sit with them, enjoying the fire,
N: while the unveiled girls shiver together behind them.
0: 
N: Only one other girl sits apart, isolated and alone. Her veil
N: only making her more of an outcast: Gertrude.
0: 
N: Tierney perches on a stump, keeping one eye on the forest.
N: And she's not the only one. They're all on edge, watching
N: the woods, jumping at shadows.
0: 
C:                          MEG
D:              How many are there, do you think?
0: 
N: Tierney perks. Listening in. Absorbing as much as she can...
0: 
C:                          MARTHA
D:              Think of all the girls who never
D:              return from their Grace Year every
D:              year. If even a fraction of that was
D:              the girls consumed by their own
D:              magic... It would be more than enough
D:              to overpower us-- if they wanted to.

D:              I heard they follow us from the

D:              strike at any moment.

E:                      (about to cry)
D:              Stop!
0: 
N: Now Kiersten speaks up. Her voice calm and assured.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              Then you'd better hope your magic
D:              comes in soon. So you have the power
D:              to fight them off.
0: 
N: The other girls consider this. Jessica looks around to make
N: sure the guards aren't listening. Then she leans in,
N: speaking low, testing the waters.
0: 
C:                          JESSICA
D:              I know it's a sin, and it's forbidden
D:              to even talk about, but... I keep
D:              wondering what my magic will be.
0: 
N: The other girls brighten, an illicit thrill rippling through
N: them. Many of them are curious, even excited. But they've
N: had to keep that to themselves-- until now.
0: 
N: A wiry girl, DENA, grins conspiratorially:
0: 
C:                          DENA
D:              Speaking to animals runs in my family.
0: 
N: Another girl, HELEN, spreads her arms wide.

C:                          HELEN
D:              Maybe I'll command the wind.

0: 
C:                          TAMMY

C:                           TIERNEY
D:              I didn't--
0: 
N: But Kiersten just laughs. Calm and cool.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              Please. She didn't steal him from me.
D:              I wanted Tommy all along. A real man
D:              who can give me sons.
0: 
N: The girls all titter at that. And Kiersten's minions quickly
N: change the subject.

0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              It's not about hope. My magic is
D:              already coming in. I can feel it
D:              tingling deep inside me... Here.
0: 
N: She presses her hands into her abdomen just below her navel.
N: The other girls murmur, intrigued.
0: 
N: Behind them, a Guard COUGHS uncomfortably. Eavesdropping.
0:

D:              Tell us! / Please? / What is it?
0: 
N: Kiersten considers. Playing up the drama. So the other girls
N: are hanging on every word. Then, almost casually:
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              I can control people with my
D:              thoughts.
0: 
N: Someone SNORTS. It's Gertrude.
0: 
N: Kiersten looks up sharply. But rather than confront Gertrude
N: directly... She turns to the girl next to her-- BETSY,
N: plain, and slight, and fragile.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              And what magic are you hoping for,
D:              Betsy? The power to turn back time?
0: 
N: Betsy shrinks in the sudden spotlight.

C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              So you might think twice about
D:              meeting Owen Gains in the meadow.

N: Betsy looks stricken. The other girls laugh openly. Her eyes
N: fill with tears. She gets up and BOLTS for the woods...
0: 
N: The Guards react--
0: 
C:                          GUARDS
D:              Hey! / Get back here! / Where do you
D:              think you're going?!
0: 
N: --but they make no move to follow. She's on her own.
0: 
N: Kiersten looks at Tierney across the fire. Still smiling.
N: Another kind of fire burning in her eyes.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              See what I made her do?
0: 
N: Tierney looks away. No one speaks. They stare out into the
N: forest with baited breath. Even the Guards.
0: 
N: A GUTTURAL ROAR cuts through the night. Everyone flinches.
0: 
N: Then another ROAR sounds out. And another. And another.
N: Coming from all directions. A call and response, like a pack
N: of wild dogs. The Ghosts.
0: 
N: And then comes the SCREAMING. Screams of terror. And pain.
0: 
N: The Guards tense. Closing their ranks around the fire.
0: 
C:                          SHORT GUARD
D:              Anyone else feel like running?
0: 0:                                                            28.
0: 
0: 
N: No one's laughing now. Even Kiersten's smile is gone. Some
N: girls start to cry. They all wince with every new scream.
0: 
C:                          RACHEL
D:              I told you. They're watching us.

S: EXT. FOREST - DAY
0: 
N: The girls walk. Veils leading the pack, the unveiled
N: following behind. Tierney observes them quietly:
0: 
N: HANNAH uses a walking stick, hobbling painfully.
0: 
N: VIVIAN picks berries from nearby bushes.
0: 
N: Laura stops now and then to pick up large rocks. She slips
N: them into her pockets and continues on.
0: 
N: Gertrude walks alone, as usual. Also observing.
0: 
N: And Kiersten moves from one cluster of girls to another,
N: whispering. The girls all turn back abruptly, looking at
N: Tierney. Are they talking about her??
0: 
N: Gertrude notices it, too. She falls back to Tierney.
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              You need to be careful.
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY
E:                    (bristles)
D:              Of Kiersten?
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              You saw what she did to Betsy.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              You think her magic has come in?
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              It doesn't matter. Magic or not, it
D:              was her doing.
0: 
N: Tierney regards Gertrude. The gloves hiding her hands.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Didn't you two used to be friends?
0: 
N: Gertrude looks at her. Eyes haunted. About to answer...
0: 
N: Suddenly, Gertrude TRIPS on a root. She stumbles, almost
N: falls, but Tierney catches her. And when they look up--
0: 0:                                                             29.
0: 
0: 
N: Up ahead, Kiersten is LOOKING AT THEM. A little smile on her
N: face. As if she made it happen.
0: 
N: Gertrude clams up. She moves ahead, leaving Tierney alone.
0: 
0: 
N: LATER
0: 
N: The girls and their guards reach a lake. Four canoes waiting
N: on the shore. The girls climb in, squeezing together, as the
N: Guards unload the supply wagon.
0: 
N: Laura stops to dig a large, heavy stone out of the wet
N: earth. She hides it under her cloak, already sagging and
N: heavy with rocks.
0: 
N: Tierney watches. Curious. What is she doing...?
0: 
N: The Guards begin to paddle.
0: 
N: Kiersten reaches over the side of the adjacent boat and
N: skims her fingers along the water...
0: 
N: Tierney keeps her eyes on Laura-- two rows in front, staring
N: straight ahead.
0: 
N: The canoes reach the middle of the lake. Laura slowly turns
N: her head...
0: 
N: For a brief moment, she looks at Tierney.
0: 
N: And then she drops over the side of the canoe.
0: 
N: The other girls scream. The Guards scramble. The Tall Guard
N: DIVES into the water after her--
0: 
C:                          SHORT GUARD
D:              She was just-- Out of nowhere-- I
D:              didn't...
0: 
N: The Tall Guard comes up sputtering. Empty-handed.
0: 
N: The Short Guard helps him back into the boat. They both look
N: spooked. The Tall Guard shivers, soaked to the bone.
0: 
N: In the next boat, Kiersten pulls her hand from the water.
N: The other girls gape. Did she do that??
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. FOREST - DAY
0: 
N: The girls walk, a new wagon carting their supplies behind
N: them. The lake is just a distant glimmer.
0: 0:                                                             30.
0: 
0: 
N: Tierney stares out into the forest, mind wandering...
N: Suddenly, in the distance she sees--
0: 
N: A FIGURE, vaguely human, cloaked in a dark shroud. Standing
N: perfectly still. Watching them.
0: 
N: Tierney stops short. The girl behind her KNOCKS into her--
0: 
C:                          GIRL BEHIND HER
D:              Hey!
0: 
N: When Tierney looks up again-- the Figure is gone.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Sorry... sorry...
0: 
N: She starts walking again. Puzzled. Scanning the woods... but
N: whatever it was, it's gone. If it was ever there at all.
0: 
N: Up ahead, the guards stop. The girls gather behind them.
N: Tierney approaches to see--
0: 
N: A TOWERING WOODEN GATE
0: 
N: Adorned with hundreds of red ribbons. Some tattered and
N: faded. Some a crisp, deep crimson.
0: 
N: A tribute to the many girls who didn't survive their Grace
N: Year. And a warning-- that the hardest part is yet to come.
0: 
N: The guards pull open the gate.
0: 
C:                          TALL GUARD
D:              Go on. Inside.
0: 
N: The girls just look at them. Scared and unsure. Finally--
0: 
N: Kiersten strides in, ready to take charge. Tierney and the
N: other girls trickle in after her...
0: 
0: 
S: INT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: A massive open plot of land. A primitive lodge house at one
N: end. Two small shacks at the other end. An old stone well in
N: the center and one lone tree. A pile of smoldering ashes
N: scattered beneath it. An axe resting against the fence.
0: 
N: The girls gape in shock. Disbelief. Horror. For the next
N: year, this is home.
0: 
C:                          VIVIAN
D:              This can't be it... For a whole year?
0: 0:                                                             31.
0: 
0: 
N: One girl, HANNAH, nudges the pile of ashes with her foot.
0: 
C:                          HANNAH
D:              I heard they did this. But I didn't
D:              believe it. It's the remaining
D:              supplies. Everything they built...
D:              everything they used to get through
D:              the year.
0: 
C:                          JENNA
D:              But-- why would they burn it?
0: 
N: Hannah looks at the lone tree. Forty-six notches carved into
N: its trunk. One of them fresh.
0: 
C:                          HANNAH
D:              Because it was done to them. Year
D:              after year...
0: 
N: But Tierney has noticed something else. Something RED in the
N: dirt. Little drops-- of blood.
0: 
N: Another drop splashes down, staining the dirt. It's just
N: like her dream...
0: 
N: Helen suddenly GASPS. She points up at the gnarled limbs of
N: the tree. The other girls follow her gaze. And now we see:
0: 
N: The tree branches are adorned with BODY PARTS.
0: 
N: The other girls back away, but Kiersten steps forward.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              It's a Punishment Tree. Just like the
D:              one in the square.
0: 
C:                          HANNAH
D:              But... who's going to do the
D:              punishing? At home the judges are the
D:              men of the Council, chosen by God.
0: 
N: The other girls murmur in agreement. They've never been
N: alone like this before...
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              What do they say about the Grace
D:              Year? What's said here... what
D:              happens here... remains here forever.
D:              That is our most sacred vow. We are
D:              the only gods here.
0: 
N: And we can see it in her face-- the rush of power.
0: 0:                                                             32.
0: 
0: 
N: Something SLAMS behind them. The girls all whirl around to
N: see-- the GATE is closed. The Guards are gone.
0: 
N: They're on their own.
0: 
0: 
T: QUICK CUTS OF THE ENCAMPMENT
0: 
N: --THE PRIVY, smeared with festering filth and buzzing flies.
0: 
N: --THE LARDER, dank and empty save for a small sack of
N: spoiled grain.
0: 
N: --THE WELL, slimy green algae clinging to the stones, the
N: rope, the bucket.
0: 
N: --THE LODGE HOUSE, dark and ominous...
0: 
0: 
S: INT. LODGE HOUSE - DAY
0: 
N: The doors creak open to reveal-- twenty iron beds set up
N: with putrid mattresses. The rest piled up in a corner. The
N: room reeks of rot and decay.
0: 
C:                          HELEN
D:              There aren't enough mattresses.
0: 
N: Vivian pokes at one of the mattresses in disgust.
0: 
C:                          VIVIAN
D:              And this one is... wet.
0: 
C:                          DENA
D:              Do we really have to sleep here?
0: 
C:                           JENNA
D:              You don't.
0: 
N: Tierney looks around-- waiting for someone to propose a
N: solution. But the other girls just look lost and helpless.
0: 
N: Kiersten struts over to the side with the mattressed beds
N: and sits down on the center bed like it's a throne.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              Veiled girls on this side.
0: 
N: The veiled girls quickly scramble to join her. Only Tierney
N: and Gertrude stand back with the others. They're used to
N: being outcasts.
0: 
N: It's a test. Battle lines being drawn.
0: 0:                                                            33.
0: 
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              Everyone needs a place to sleep.
0: 
N: Kiersten and the veiled girls watch from across the room...
0: 
N: ...as Tierney, Gertrude, and the unveiled girls work
N: together to take down the stack of bed frames.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
0: 
N: The girls all sit around a fire. Kiersten holds court over
N: the veiled girls. The others have separated into smaller
N: groups. Suddenly--
0: 
N: A high-pitched SHRIEK pierces the night air. From somewhere
N: out in the forest. The girls all freeze. Shaken. Thrilled.
0: 
C:                             JENNA
D:              Ghost.
0: 
N: Tierney looks like she wants to say something... but she
N: holds her tongue.
0: 
N: Jessica nods sagely.
0: 
C:                          JESSICA
D:              Poor girls. Clinging to their magic,
D:              even in death. Even though it
D:              tortures them.
0: 
C:                          HELEN
E:                    (nervous)
D:              But... they can't come in here, can
D:              they? Into the Encampment?
0: 
N: Now Meg pipes up, eager to contribute.
0: 
C:                          MEG
D:              No. The Encampment is sacred ground.
D:              That's why they're so angry. And why
D:              they're so eager to kill us the
D:              second we leave.
0: 
N: Another SHRIEK echoes out. Some girls jolt, others tremble,
N: one of them starts to cry. They're terrified.
0: 
N: And Tierney can't keep quiet any longer.
0: 
C:                             TIERNEY
D:              It's an elk.
0: 
N: All eyes turn to her.
0: 0:                                                             34.

C:                          JENNA
D:              How would you know?
0: 
N: Hannah pipes up timidly.
0: 
C:                          HANNAH
D:              Is that your magic, Tierney? Knowing
D:              things...?
0: 
N: Tierney shrugs. Uncomfortable in the spotlight.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I used to go into the northern
D:              forests with my Father this time of
D:              year to check on the trappers. That's
D:              the sound they make when they're
D:              looking for a mate. The elk, I mean.
D:              Not the trappers.
0: 
N: The girls smile. But Kiersten just sneers.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              See? Not magic. Just her Father
D:              treating her as a son all her life.
0: 
N: The other girls giggle, but there's a moment of tension.
N: Tierney can feel them eyeing her.
0: 
N: Another SHRIEK-- but the girls don't seem to mind. They're
N: talking, settling in, enjoying this taste of freedom...
0: 
N: Until Kiersten suddenly pulls the red ribbon out of her hair
N: and shakes her braids free. Her long hair spills down over
N: her shoulders in waves, glowing in the firelight.
0: 
N: The other girls gasp. Scandalized. Thrilled.
0: 
C:                           GIRLS
D:              What are you doing?! / Your ribbon--!
D:              / Your hair!
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              Who's going to stop me?
0: 
N: The other girls look at each other. She has a point.
0: 
N: Rachel eagerly reaches for her own ribbon... but Kiersten
N: GRABS her wrist. Hard.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              No. Only girls who have claimed their
D:              magic can remove their braid.
E:                          (MORE)
0: 0:                                                          35.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              We all know I have. Can anyone else
D:              claim the same?
0: 
N: The other girls titter with excitement and Kiersten basks in
N: the attention. Pleased to have the spotlight back.
0: 
N: Tierney touches her own braid wistfully.
0: 
C:                          BEHIND HER
D:              This is how it starts.
0: 
N: Tierney turns; it was Gertrude who spoke, talking to herself.
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY
D:              What?
0: 
N: Gertrude just stares into the fire.
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              This is how we turn against each
D:              other.
0: 
N: Tierney watches the other girls. Unsettled...

0: 
S: EXT. TOWN - SUNRISE (DREAM)
0: 
N: We float toward the church, the Punishment Tree, where the
N: HANGED WOMAN is waiting.
0: 
N: She stands on the platform with the noose around her broken
N: neck. Head bowed. Hair hanging in her face. Shroud billowing
N: around her.
0: 
N: Blood drips from her hands, pooling on the ground below. And
N: then suddenly--
0: 
N: Her head JERKS UP. Her mouth twists into a SNARL.
0: 
N: And she LUNGES off the platform right at us--
0: 
0: 
S: INT. LODGE HOUSE - DAWN
0: 
N: Tierney gasps awake. She looks around-- did anyone notice?
0: 
N: No. Everyone seems to be sleeping. But the gray light of dawn
N: is seeping through the cracks in the rough-hewn walls...
0: 
N: She shivers. Her breath PUFFS in little clouds in front of
N: her face. It's cold.
0: 0:                                                            36.

N: Tierney slips out of bed, pulls on her mother's heavy coat.
N: Time to work.

0: 
S: EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAWN
0: 
N: THWACK! Tierney heaves the axe to split a tree branch. A
N: stack of logs piled nearby.
0: 
N: She's alone, isolated, at the far end of the Encampment. The
N: white noise of the forest a deafening buzz all around her.
0: 
N: She pauses to wipe her brow, when--
0: 
N: Something CRUNCHES on the other side of the high fence that
N: separates the camp from the outside world.
0: 
N: Tierney freezes. All her senses attuned.
0: 
N: She tightens her grip on the axe and slinks forward...
N: careful to make no sound... toward a KNOTHOLE in the fence.
0: 
N: Slowly... cautiously... she presses her eye to the hole...
0: 
N: MOVEMENT FLASHES BY--

C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Gah--!
0: 
N: Tierney stumbles backwards. She clutches the axe to her.
N: Adrenaline pumping... Ready to strike...
0: 
N: But all she hears are the sounds of the forest.
0: 
N: Was that a ghost??
0: 
0: 
N: LATER
0: 
N: Tierney carries firewood toward the center of camp.

D:              Get back. Veiled girls first!
0: 
N: She comes around the privy to see Jessica and Jenna pushing
N: their way through a line of girls to the front of the well,
N: grabbing the algae-covered bucket from Martha.
0: 
N: That's when-- Gertrude comes storming out of the lodge
N: house. Trembling with anger and humiliation.

0: 
N: For the first time, we see Gertrude's BARE HANDS-- the
N: thick, rope-like scars across her knuckles. The result of a
N: brutal beating.
0: 
N: The girls snicker. Murmurs of Dirty Gertie ripple through
N: the crowd. Jenna and Jessica just smirk.
0: 
C:                          JESSICA
D:              Must have been a ghost.

D:              Try not to touch anyone. You don't
D:              want to make them dirty, too.
0: 
N: Jessica and Jenna drink their fill, shove the bucket back to
N: Martha, and stride off to find Kiersten.
0: 
N: Martha sips some water, makes a face.

D:              Ugh. Is this all there is to drink?
0:

0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              We could make rain barrels.

E:                    (impressed)

D:              It's a lot of work. But if we can
D:              find the right tools...
0: 
N: Gertrude approaches as well. Desperate to be included, to
N: put this latest humiliation behind her.
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              ...I'd like to help.
0: 
N: The other girls look at Tierney-- is she really going to
N: include this outcast? But Tierney just nods.

N: exhausted and dirty from a hard day's work, to find:
0: 
N: The other girls are holding hands in a circle around--
0: 
N: DENA, standing naked, with Kiersten at her side.
0: 
C:                          HELEN
D:              What are they doing?
0: 
N: Dena shivers. Cold, nervous. Feeling everyone's eyes on her.
N: She squirms as Kiersten presses a palm into her abdomen.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              You should feel it here. A warmth, a
D:              tingling. Like your blood is reaching
D:              for the surface, wanting to scream.
D:              Do you feel it?
0:

0:

N: Dena looks the most surprised of all.

D:              Answer.
0: 
N: Tierney watches, spellbound. Is this what it's like? Coming
N: into your magic?
0: 
N: Dena digs her fingernails into the earth and HOWLS back.
N: Stretching her neck. Straining for the magic within her.
0: 
N: She keeps howling until her cheeks are flushed and streaked
N: with tears. Finally-- Kiersten PULLS the red ribbon from her
N: braid, letting her hair fall wild and loose around her.

D:              I knew you could do it.
0: 
N: Dena stands up, rising like a woman reborn. She takes
N: Kiersten's hand. The circle parts to let them through and
N: they walk toward the lodge house together.
0: 
N: The other girls watch. Awed and envious...

D:              Whatever it is... it sure makes them

0: 
N: Tierney looks up at the trees, wondering what had Helen so
N: entranced. For a moment, the leaves seem to RIPPLE and
N: PULSE. But then she blinks, and the effect is gone.

N: Just an illusion... or something more?

N: Blistered, sweaty, exhausted. Meanwhile:

D:              I can hear the wind whispering!

0: 
C:                          HANNAH
D:              I made it wilt just by looking at it!
0: 
N: With great ceremony, Kiersten unties the red ribbons from
N: Tammy and Hannah's braids. They shake their hair loose as
N: the other girls rejoice around them.
0: 
N: Suddenly, Meg swipes her hand through the flames.
0: 
C:                          MEG
D:              I... I can't feel it!
0: 
N: Meg looks at Kiersten for approval. The other girls buzz.
0: 
N: Meg tries again. This time she HOLDS her hand in the flames.
N: That gets Tierney's attention.

N: ANTS crawling over her arm. She FLINGS the covers off--
0: 
N: Her entire body is covered with ants.
0: 
N: She flails. Scratching at her skin. She LEAPS out of bed--
0: 
N: And suddenly the ants are gone. She turns to inspect her
N: bed-- Nothing there.
0: 
N: She tries to calm down, catch her breath. What was that?
0: 
N: Then a thought occurs to her. She peers through the dim
N: light over to KIERSTEN'S BED... It's empty.

D:              Depravity?
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
C:              It's... complicated. I helped
D:              Kiersten steal something from her
D:              home. And when we got caught with
D:              it-- I took the blame. I thought it
D:              would be easier that way, that I was
D:              helping her...
0:

0: 
C:                           GERTRUDE
D:              It was her father's. A lithograph. He
D:              has a whole collection, from long ago.
E:                    (beat)
D:              It was a picture of a woman. She was

D:              That's why Kiersten calls you Dirty
D:              Gertie? But-- you were friends! How
D:              could she let you take the blame--
D:              and then ostracize you for it? How
D:              could you let her get away with it?
0: 
N: Gertrude shrugs sadly. As if she's asked herself the same
N: thing many times. She looks at Tierney; open, vulnerable.

D:              would go back to how they used to be.
D:              I know how that sounds, but... Have
D:              you ever been with someone who makes

D:              nothing you can do to fight it, and
D:              when you touch, it's like-- there was
D:              a piece of you you never knew was
D:              missing, but finally you're... whole?
0: 
N: Off Tierney: realizing Gertrude feels that way about
N: Kiersten. And then realizing-- she has never felt that way
N: about anyone. Yet another thing that's wrong with her.
0: 
N: And Gertrude can see it on her face; Tierney doesn't
N: understand. So she puts her guard back up.

C:                          GERTRUDE (cont'd)

C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              Believe it or not, I want to help you.

D:              I know what your problem is. Your
D:              magic hasn't come in. And you're
D:              wondering why, what's wrong with you.
D:              Are you doomed to repeat your
D:              mother's fate?
0: 
N: Tierney winces. That's exactly what she's been wondering.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              When really the explanation is
D:              obvious.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              It is?
0: 
N: Kiersten moves toward her. Gentle and calm, like a friend.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              Completely. At least, to me. See, I
D:              think you actually have the opposite
D:              problem. I think you've been burning
D:              through your magic for years, right
D:              under all our noses. Maybe without
D:              even realizing it yourself.
0: 
N: Tierney reacts, shaken. Could that be true?
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              That's how you got your Father to
D:              teach you all those things.
0: 
N: Kiersten leans in close. And now all trace of her gentle
N: sweetness is gone. Replaced with cold, cruel contempt.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              That's how you stole Michael from me.
D:              And now... you're all. Used. Up.
0: 
N: And Tierney recoils. The spell is broken.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I didn't steal Michael. I don't even
D:              want Michael! I don't know why he
D:              chose me but it wasn't my doing.
0: 
N: The trees seem to PULSE with energy. She squeezes her eyes
N: shut. But when she opens them again, they're still PULSING.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              Regardless. All this work? It's a
D:              distraction for the rest of us.

0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              We don't need to be comfortable and
D:              well fed. We need to focus on the
D:              only thing that matters. Our magic.
0: 
N: OFF TIERNEY: The trees are pressing in on her. Bending,
N: pulsing to the beat of her heart. Her head is spinning...
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              If we aren't prepared when winter
D:              comes, girls are going to die.
0: 
N: But Kiersten just laughs.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              It's the Grace Year, Tierney! Of
D:              course girls are going to die! The
D:              point is how we live while we're
D:              here-- in the one place, at the one
D:              time in our lives, when we can truly
D:              be free. No tempering our feelings or
D:              swallowing our pride. Everything
D:              that's inside us, we can just let it
D:              all out... until it's gone. And then
D:              we won’t have to feel anything at all.
0: 
N: Suddenly Kiersten looks lost. Sad. Intensely vulnerable.
0: 
N: Tierney closes her eyes. And when she opens them, finally,
N: mercifully, the vision is gone. The trees are just trees.
N: She sighs. Exasperated... and exhausted.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              What do you want me to say? The other
D:              girls can do what they like. I don't
D:              know why my magic hasn't come in, but
D:              until it does... I can't just sit
D:              around and do nothing.
0: 
N: Kiersten shrugs. Suit yourself.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              Then I can't help you after all. You
D:              win, Tierney. You're on your own.
D:              Just the way you like it.
0: 
N: She picks up the axe and walks away. In the distance,
N: thunder RUMBLES in gathering storm clouds. A warning...

N: cornering Gertrude against the larder.

D:              What was that about?

0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              She apologized. She wants to be

0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              After everything she did to you? You
D:              can't possibly believe her.
0: 
N: Gertrude looks away, toward the larger group of girls.
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              You don't know what it's like. I
D:              just... I don't want to be Dirty
D:              Gertie. And she can make it stop.
0: 
N: And now Tierney connects the dots. Realizing...
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              And what did you promise her in

0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              I think it's best... if we don't

S: EXT. ENCAMPMENT - LATER
0: 
N: Tierney is alone in the trees at the back of the Encampment.
N: Down on all fours, naked this time, her hands and knees
N: pressed into the cold ground.
0: 
N: Gritting her teeth. Squeezing her eyes. Clenching every
N: muscle in her body. Willing her magic to come...
0: 
N: She feels a pinch. And another. She opens her eyes-- SPIDERS
N: are crawling all over her!
0: 
N: She shrieks-- leaps up-- smacking them off her--
0: 
N: And just as suddenly, the spiders are gone.
0: 
N: Tierney sinks to the ground. What is happening to her??

0: 
N: Heavy storm clouds block out the sun as Tierney returns to
N: the center of camp with an armful of firewood...
0: 
N: To find all the girls huddled around the front fence.
N: Kiersten is speaking to someone near the gate, impossible to
N: see who from the back of the crowd.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              All you have to do is run to the cove
D:              and back. Then I'll take out your
D:              braid, and you'll be one of us.
0: 
N: Tierney pushes her way to the front-- it's Helen. Looking
N: timid and unsure as Kiersten strokes her hair like a child.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              She can't leave the Encampment!

D:              The ghosts can't see me if I'm

0: 
N: The other girls push Tierney back. Physically blocking her
N: from the front. Tierney scans the crowd for an ally.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              I'll even let you wear my veil.
D:              That's how much I believe in you.

N: gate. The forest stretches out before them, wild and dark.
0: 
N: The other girls step back. Kiersten nudges Helen forward.

N: way forward-- through the crowd-- through the gate-- into
0: 
0: 
N: THE FOREST.
0: 
N: She stops, realizing what she's done. The trees loom over
N: her. The wind whips her. The noises of the forest echo...
0: 
N: For a moment, Tierney is frozen in fear. But she gathers her
N: courage and races down the path...
0: 
N: She spots Helen up ahead, the veil trailing behind her.

D:               You can see me?
0: 
N: A LIGHTNING STRIKE blinds them. When their vision clears--
0: 
N: A FIGURE emerges from the thicket of trees behind Helen.
N: Wrapped in a dark, gauzy shroud. A GHOST.
0: 
N: At first Tierney is too stunned to react. Totally paralyzed.
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY
D:               Helen...
0: 
N: Helen frowns. With growing dread she turns around--
0: 
N: The Ghost's shroud-covered arms SNAP HER NECK like a twig.
0: 
N: Helen crumples to the ground. Dead. And the Ghost lets out a
N: ROAR that echoes into the trees...
0: 
N: Then another ROAR bellows out of the brush. And another. And
N: another. Coming from all directions. They're everywhere.
0: 
N: That breaks Tierney's paralysis. She turns and flees, but--
N: THE GIRLS ARE CLOSING THE GATE.
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:               NO--!
0: 
N: But the gate SLAMS shut. She POUNDS on the gate as her
N: heartbeat POUNDS in her ears. But it's no use.
0: 0:                                                             51.
0: 
0: 
N: Behind her, the Ghost is fast approaching-- Tierney LEAPS up
N: onto the gate--
0: 
N: Grabbing the dead girls' ribbons, PULLING her way up...
N: DIGGING her fingernails into the splintery wood... CLAWING
N: and KICKING until she TOPPLES over the edge--

C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              Why did you do that?

C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              Don't you see what she's doing? She
D:              wants you to deny your magic. She
D:              wants you to die out here! Or worse--
D:              to hold on to it so when we return to
D:              the county you'll be sent to the
D:              gallows. Just like her mother.
0:

D:              we're meant to do. But I say it's
D:              time we turn our backs on her. From
D:              this moment on, anyone who associates
D:              with this heretic will be punished.

N: Tierney watches, helpless, as the girls react. Averting

0: 
N: The door creaks open. Footsteps coming near.
0: 
N: Tierney TENSES. Like an animal playing dead. Waiting...
0: 
N: There's a soft TAP on the floor behind her back. And then
N: the footsteps quickly retreat. When the door creaks closed,
N: Tierney rolls over to find--
0: 
N: A POTATO. Smaller than her fist.
0: 
N: She sinks her teeth into it... Desperate for sustenance...

0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              I gave her the potato. Look at her.
D:              She's starving.
0: 
N: But Kiersten is looking at Gertrude. Her face inscrutable.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              Is this how you repay me? After
D:              everything I did for you? I gave you
D:              a second chance, I forgave you... And
D:              that still wasn't enough, was it? We
D:              both know what you really want.
0: 
N: Gertrude shirks back, eyes pleading.

C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              She tried to kiss me. She wanted me
D:              to do the dirty things she found in a
D:              dirty picture. To sin against God.
0: 
N: The crowd of girls reacts-- horrified, outraged, gleeful.
0: 
N: Gertrude grabs Tierney's arm. Trying to lead her away.
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              Come on. Let's go--
0: 
N: But suddenly Gertrude's head JERKS back. She cries out.
N: Falls to her knees. Blood pooling down her back as--
0: 
N: Kiersten clenches Gertrude's braid in her fist. A bloody
N: patch of scalp at one end, the red ribbon at the other. In
N: her other hand she holds the axe.
0: 
N: The other girls are stunned. Even Kiersten looks shocked.
N: But we watch her expression change as she decides to own
N: it-- to embrace it. She raises the bloody braid with glee.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              I warned you, didn't I? Those who

0: 
N: Tierney is horrified. She can barely whisper--

C:                          TIERNEY
D:              What did you do?
0: 
N: Kiersten ignores her. Drunk with power. Manic with energy.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              We thought shunning her would be
D:              enough. But we must expel this poison
D:              from our system. Open the gates.
0: 
N: Tierney backs away.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              No. No, I'll... I'll put my hand in

D:              Give her to the ghosts and be done.
0: 
N: Tierney staggers back. But the girls are surrounding her...
N: The trees pressing down from above... the high walls of the
N: fence closing in...
0: 
N: There is nowhere to run.
0: 
N: Dozens of hands are PUSHING her, SHOVING her, HERDING her
N: toward the gate. Dozens of faces SMILING and SCOWLING.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              Wait. I want her coat.
0: 
N: The hands RIP at her, TEARING at her clothes, trying to PRY
N: the coat away. Tierney clings to it desperately--
0: 
N: But then Kiersten is blocking her path, raising the axe.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              I said GIVE IT TO ME--
0: 
N: A HUSH falls over the girls. They drop their hands. Step
N: back. Their black eyes wide with surprise and fear.
0: 
N: Even Kiersten falls back. She looks at Tierney with a low,
N: nervous laugh...
0: 
N: And then they're all laughing. Tierney follows their gaze...
0: 
N: TO THE AXE EMBEDDED BETWEEN HER SHOULDER AND HER CHEST.
0: 
N: Her hands tremble as they reach for the handle. She YANKS--
0: 
N: The girls laugh harder. Tierney tugs and tugs until
N: finally-- she pulls the axe out. And a TORRENT OF BLOOD
N: comes gushing with it.
0: 
N: The girls laugh harder. Doubling over. Tears streaming.
N: Birds start to caw, a mocking sound. The trees seem to
N: shake, as if they're laughing, too.
0: 
N: And Tierney-- RUNS. Still gripping the axe.
0: 
N: Past the girls. Out the gates. Into the forest.
0: 
N: The laughter echoing behind her...
0: 
0: 
N: ON TIERNEY
0: 
N: Staggering through the woods, a trail of blood behind her.

0: 
0: 
N: The ground sways under her feet. The trees seem to reach for
N: her. Shadows dancing all around...
0: 
N: Her vision blurs around the edges. The axe sags in her arms.
N: She's ready to collapse. When--
0: 
N: One of the shadows STEPS into the path behind her. A FIGURE
N: hidden by a shroud. A Ghost.
0: 
N: But Tierney keeps going. Lumbering toward--
0: 
0: 
N: THE LAKE.
0: 
N: Frozen over with ice. The moon shines down, creating a
N: perfect reflection on its surface.
0: 
N: Tierney pauses at the bank. Unsure. But THE GHOST is coming
N: toward her. A faceless angel of death.
0: 
N: Tierney steps out onto the ice. Testing the weight... It
N: holds! She takes another step. Another. Another...
0: 
N: CRAAAAAACK. She freezes. Slowly, she turns to the shore...
0: 
N: THE GHOST has followed her onto the ice. Reaching for her...
0: 
N: The wind whips her. The moonlight glints off the deep black
N: of her eyes. She looks completely unhinged.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Stay away from me!
0: 
N: With the last of her strength she raises the axe. Blood
N: trickles down the handle, pooling on the ice at her feet...
0: 
N: Tierney heaves the axe down into the ice.
0: 
N: The CRAAAAAAACK echoes all around her, and then suddenly
0: 
N: She PLUNGES down into the frigid water--
0: 
N: And everything goes
0: 
N:                                                   DARK.
0: 
0: 
N: A FRANTIC GASP OF BREATH AS--
0: 
N: IMAGES flash across the screen:
0: 
N: --A bonfire climbing into the night.

0: 
0: 
N: --A serrated blade tearing through Tierney's clothes.
0: 
N: --A circle of women, dancing with arms outstretched.
0: 
N: --Strips of cloth tying down Tierney's arms and legs.
0: 
N: --Smiling, laughing, faces in the firelight.
0: 
N: --A hot iron searing into Tierney's shoulder flesh.
0: 
N: --The Woman, hanging from the Punishment Tree. But it's not
N: blood dripping from her hands. It's tiny RED FLOWER PETALS.
0: 
N: They spill onto the ground where twin patches of red flowers
N: are growing...
0: 
0: 
N: A ROOM
0: 
N: Gradually comes into focus:
0: 
N: Long strips of sinewy meat hanging from hooks. Tanned hides
N: drying on a rack. An assortment of knives and tools on a
N: rough table. A fire crackling in a hearth.
0: 
N: Tierney tries to sit up, only to find--
0: 
N: Her arms and legs are restrained. She starts to panic--
0: 
N: MOVEMENT in the corner as-- the SHROUDED FIGURE approaches.
0: 
N: Tierney reacts. Twisting and writhing in vain--
0: 
N: The Figure grabs her face. Squeezes her cheeks to open her
N: mouth. Tilts a cup to her lips. And now Tierney sees--
0: 
N: EYES staring down at her from a gap in the shroud. Dark and
N: piercing. As if they are staring into her very soul.
0: 
N: Tierney is so surprised that she chokes on the liquid. She
N: coughs and sputters--
0: 
N: But her vision blurs, and her eyes flutter closed...
0: 
0: 
S: INT. ROOM - LATER
0: 
N: Tierney wakes. The room is quiet and still. The fire has
N: gone out. She turns her head, looking around. No sign of The
N: Figure with the dark eyes. Suddenly--
0: 
N: A ROAR sounds in the distance. Followed by a chorus of ROARS
N: answering it, echoing from all directions. The Ghosts.
0: 0:                                                             60.
0: 
0: 
N: She struggles against the restraint holding her good arm
N: down. Twisting, yanking, rubbing her skin raw. Bleeding onto
N: the bed. Gritting her teeth. Blinking back tears. But the
N: more she struggles, the tighter the restraint pulls. No use.
0: 
N: She thinks... looks around. There's a table on the other
N: side of her, but she can't see what's on it.
0: 
N: Her fingers are just close enough they might be able to
N: grasp the table leg-- but it's her bad arm. Can she do it?
0: 
N: She wiggles her fingers. They barely graze the table leg.
0: 
N: She stretches her arm out... pushing through the pain...
N: Until she has a firm grip on the table leg.
0: 
N: She takes a few quick, deep breaths. Steeling herself...
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              One... two... THREE--
0: 
N: She YANKS. The wound in her shoulder RIPS-- she CRIES OUT--
N: her arm goes LIMP-- but the table TIPS toward her, its
N: contents sliding onto her bed...
0: 
N: A glass vial of liquid. A roll of gauze. And-- A BLADE.
0: 
N: She twists her torso and pulls the pelts covering her with
N: her teeth, maneuvering the blade over to the other side of
N: the bed. The fingers of her good hand reach... stretch...
0: 
N: Got it. She positions the blade to slice through the hide.
N: Sawing... Sweating... Eyes on the door...
0: 
N: Until finally-- the hide tears enough that her hand slips
N: free. Success!
0: 
N: She rolls over and cuts through the restraint binding her
N: bad arm, still limp and useless at her side.
0: 
N: No matter. She sits up, pulls back the pelts, and cuts
N: through the strips binding her legs. She's free--!
0: 
N: SOUNDS come from outside the room. Oh shit. The Figure is
N: returning. And the table is overturned and there's blood on
N: the bed and severed restraints. What to do...?
0: 
N: Tierney acts fast. She THROWS HERSELF off the bed, landing
N: in a contorted heap on the floor. Face hidden. Perfectly
N: still. Playing dead.
0: 
N: TIERNEY'S POV:   We HEAR the Figure coming toward her.
0: 0:                                                             61.
0: 
0: 
N: The Figure grabs her by the shoulders. Rolls her over...
0: 
N: NOW.
0: 
N: Tierney PLUNGES the blade into the shroud--
0: 
N: And it STICKS. Sliding into thick, solid flesh. Tierney
N: reacts, stunned--
0: 
N: The Figure cries out-- staggers back--
0: 
N: And Tierney sees her chance. She SCRAMBLES to her feet...
0: 
N: Her weak legs buckle under her. But she picks herself up.
N: Her left arm hanging limply, dead weight.
0: 
N: She scrambles for the doorway-- a thick hide, sunlight
N: shining behind it.
0: 
N: Behind her, The Figure calls out--
0: 
C:                          FIGURE
D:              Stop--!
0: 
N: And to our surprise, the Figure's voice is low, guttural.
N: It's the voice of a YOUNG MAN.
0: 
N: But Tierney ignores his warning. She LUNGES through--
0: 
N: INTO NOTHING BUT AIR. Oh shit. This room is in a--
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. TREE - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: She loses her balance. Teetering toward the ground--
0: 
N: The Young Man GRABS her by her bad arm, JOLTING her to a
N: stop. She SCREAMS in agony--
0: 
C:                          YOUNG MAN
D:              Give me-- your other-- hand!
0: 
N: Tierney dangles over the edge. A forty foot drop to the
N: snow-covered ground. Wind biting into her bare skin.
0: 
C:                          YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
D:              Tierney!
0: 
N: The Young Man grips her from above, leaning over the edge of
N: the narrow platform on which this room-- A HUNTING BLIND --
N: has been built.

N: Tierney reaches up. The Young Man grasps her good wrist and
N: pulls her up. Back into the--
0: 
0: 
S: INT. HUNTING BLIND - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: They lay gasping on the floor. Tierney curled in the fetal
N: position. The Young Man clutching the wound in his abdomen.
N: Both of them reeling, for different reasons:
0: 
C:                          YOUNG MAN
D:              You... stabbed me...
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              You're not... a ghost...?
0: 
N: Suddenly her face contorts as something trickles down her
N: arm. A thick, oozing pus tinged with blood--
0: 
N: She looks down at the WOUND in her shoulder-- gaping open,
N: maggots squirming in rotted, gangrenous flesh.
0: 
N: The room seems to LURCH. Tierney's eyes roll back...
0: 
0: 
S: INT. HUNTING BLIND - LATER
0: 
N: She wakes up, back in bed. Her shoulder freshly bandaged.
N: The Young Man is sitting at her side. She RECOILS as he
N: presses his wrist to her forehead.

N: The Young Man lifts a cup to her lips. She drinks greedily--

D:              Who are you?

N: He doesn't answer. Suddenly-- Tierney lurches over and
N: VOMITS over the side of the bed. Her vision blurs.

D:              I don't know.
0: 
N: His voice as flat and cold. As if to say, I don't care.
N: Tierney's eyelids start to flutter.

D:              How do you... know my name...?

S: INT. HUNTING BLIND - LATER
0: 
N: A chorus of echoing ROARS startles Tierney awake. She sits
N: up... winces. Her shoulder is throbbing. Across the room,
N: the Young Man stirring a pot over the fire.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I need medicine. Poppy... or valerian

D:              At this point, it will do more harm

E:                    (beat; reluctant)
D:              Are you hungry?
0: 
N: Tierney considers. Eyeing whatever's cooking in that pot.

C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Yes.
0: 
N: But he tosses a sack of walnuts onto her bed instead.
N: Tierney picks one up. The nut rattles inside the shell.

D:              Then you won't eat.
0: 
N: Tierney fumes. Famished and frustrated. But she keeps
N: trying... And finally-- the nut cracks open. She scoops out
N: the meat and wolfs it down. Then onto the next nut...

N: Tierney blinks awake from a fitful sleep to see The Young
N: Man tending the fire, his back to her. And for the first
N: time, we're really SEEING him:
0: 
N: His shroud is off, his body illuminated in the firelight--
0: 0:                                                            65.
0: 
0: 
N: Lean muscle coiling under bare skin etched with scars. His
N: hair is dark and thick. His face sharp, angular.
0: 
N: Tierney watches. Motionless beneath the fur pelts. Taking in
N: the sight of him with quiet awe. Absolutely riveted.
0: 
N: He turns abruptly. She sees a FLASH of dark eyes-- but she
N: squeezes her eyes shut, feigning sleep. Did he see her...?!
0: 
N: When she finally dares to look again...
0: 
N: He's back to tending the fire. But now his shroud is on.

N: Hidden beneath his shroud, the Young Man dresses Tierney's
N: wound. His movements are gruff, cursory.

D:              What's your name?
E:                    (no answer)
D:              How do you know my name? Have we met?
0: 
N: Still no answer. Not a conversationalist, this guy.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              Are there others like you? Out here
D:              in the forest?
0: 
N: Oops; he drops the cloth. Tierney reaches for it--
0: 
C:                            TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              Here--
0: 
N: --but her sudden movement startles him. He jolts away.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              Are you afraid of me?

C:                          YOUNG MAN
D:              You stabbed me.
0: 
N: She holds the cloth out to him. He eyes her warily. But
N: finally, he yanks the cloth out of her grasp--
0: 
N: And as he does, she GRABS his shroud with her good hand,
N: getting a fistful of fabric.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I want answers. Or I swear I will rip

N: But he digs his fingers into her wound. She HOWLS with pain,
N: releasing her grip. Writhing on the table.
0: 
N: And by the time she can see past the pain, he's gone.

N: practicing with the nutcracker, sitting by a fire.

E:                    (surprised)

0: 
C:                          YOUNG MAN
D:              I think, if I were in your position,

0:

D:              You want answers.
0: 
N: OFF TIERNEY: both relieved to be talking and terrified of
N: what he might say. But the not-knowing is worse, so:

C:                          TIERNEY
D:              ...Yes.
0:

D:              I'm a Poacher. I patrol the forest to

0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              By killing innocent girls?

D:              They're hardly innocent if they break

0: 
N: Tierney reels. Trying to process. Her voice trembling:

D:              She was running toward the lake. A
D:              ghost-- someone snapped her neck.
0: 
C:                          YOUNG MAN
D:              No. That wasn't me.
0: 
N: As they go, Tierney's fear turns into anger, and their
N: conversation takes on a RAPID FIRE feel:
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              So there are more of you?
0:

D:              Yes. Many more. Maybe a dozen.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I've lived in the County all my life
D:              and I've never heard of Poachers.
0: 
C:                          YOUNG MAN
D:              No, you hear stories about ghosts who
D:              haunt the woods and kill any girl who
D:              strays from the path. You hear what
D:              they want you to hear, whatever they
D:              think will keep you in line and in
D:              the Encampment where you belong. And
D:              when that doesn't work... we take
D:              matters into our own hands.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              But-- why would they lie to us?
0: 
C:                          YOUNG MAN
D:              For the same reason they banish you
D:              from your homes and lock you away in
D:              a cage for a year. Because they're
D:              afraid of you. And your magic.
0:

D:              Do you think if I had even an ounce

D:              here in this... this... tree house
D:              butcher shop?

D:              seem terribly happy about it.

D:              What should I call you then? Boy?
0: 
N: Under the shroud, she can see his body tense. She's gotten
N: under his skin. And there's a part of her that feels smug.

D:              Ryker. That's your name.
0: 
N: Ryker raises his hands. A gesture of surrender. But Tierney
N: doesn't move. She grips the blade.
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              Just... take it easy...

D:              You'd rather we leave them to unleash
D:              their magic on anyone in their path?
0: 
N: There's another blade on the table next to him, but he
N: doesn't go for it. He keeps his hands raised.

0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              No. I wouldn't let that happen.

D:              What aren't you telling me?

0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              I made a promise. To keep you safe.

C:                          TIERNEY
D:              To who?
0: 
N: And now he does look at her. Steady and unwavering.
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              Your Father.
0: 
N: It feels like a punch in the gut. Like the air has been
N: ripped from her lungs. The blade trembles in her hand.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              How... do you know my Father?

C:                          RYKER
D:              When you're ready-- when you're
D:              strong enough-- I'll show you.
0: 
N: She looks at him-- standing there, open and honest, with all
N: his secrets laid bare. Without his shroud he seems exposed,
N: vulnerable. And the way he makes her feel is undeniable.
0: 
N: Tierney considers. Can she really trust him...?
0: 
N: And finally-- she makes a decision. She puts the blade down,
N: slides it across the floor.

S: EXT. FOREST - DAY
0: 
N: Birds chirping. Trees budding with flowers. New growth on
N: the forest floor. And TWO FIGURES in heavy shrouds tramp
N: through the undergrowth, cresting a high ridge.
0: 
N: Only their eyes are visible, and we recognize them instantly:
N: Ryker... and Tierney. She's traded her veil for a shroud.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              This is a terrible idea.
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              You're doing fine. Just relax. Act
D:              confident.
0: 
N: His hand brushes the small of her back. An intimate gesture,
N: but casual. A sign of their new comfort around each other.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              If anyone catches me--

D:              You're welcome to go back to the
D:              blind. But look-- we're here.
0: 
N: He crouches down low at the top of the ridge. Leaning over
N: the edge to see what's below. Tierney follows suit, peering
N: over the edge to see what's below--
0: 
N: THE OUTSKIRTS VILLAGE.
0: 
N: Thatched cottages nestled in a clearing. Strings of herbs
N: and freshly tanned hides and simple linen garments hanging
N: to dry in the sun. Children running wild between the trees.
0: 
N: And women. Chopping wood, doing wash, tending gardens, using
N: tools. So many women... and not a man in sight.
0: 
N: And Tierney is in awe. She's never seen anything like it.

C:                          TIERNEY
D:              What is this place?
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              My home. This is why I do what I do.
D:              To protect my people. To keep them
D:              safe.

C:                          RYKER
D:              It's not.
0: 
N: But Tierney doesn't notice. She's focused on something else:
0: 
N: The clearing is dotted with tiny RED FLOWERS. And there's
N: something about them that seems so familiar...
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Those flowers...
0: 
N: But suddenly-- below them, a young woman comes into view.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              I know her! She used to work in the
D:              mill, but then-- she was banished...
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              Many of the women here were. The
D:              older wives, they don't tend to last
D:              very long. But the younger ones can
D:              earn a living.
0: 
N: There's something biting in his voice.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              But-- where are the men?
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              They visit from time to time. Just
D:              long enough to satisfy their urges.
D:              Then it's back to town, to their
D:              pious wives and respectable families.
D:              But at least they pay for the
D:              pleasure-- just enough to keep their
D:              bastard children from starving.
0: 
N: As if on cue, a middle-aged man emerges from one of the
N: houses, buckling his belt and adjusting his coat.

C:                          TIERNEY

D:              laborer... You can always be a whore.
D:              Their sons are raised to be trappers
D:              or poachers and their daughters age
D:              into the family trade. It's a hard
D:              life, but it could be worse. At least
D:              out here... we're free.

D:              Your Father, he's one of the good
D:              ones. He comes here to heal, lends
D:              his services out of the goodness of
D:              his heart. My youngest sister, she
D:              was stricken with pox this time last
D:              year. He saved her life, refused any
D:              payment in return.
E:                    (beat)
D:              But he did ask a favor.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              That you would protect me.

C:                            RYKER
D:              If I could.
0: 
N: But it's too much for Tierney. Her stomach lurches.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I'm going to--
0: 
N: She staggers to her feet and hurries down the hill. Tearing
N: off her shroud moments before--
0: 
N: She vomits into the underbrush. She needs... water...
0: 
N: Ryker's footsteps crunch behind her.

C:                          RYKER
D:              Are you alright--?
0: 
N: But the RUSH of a stream echoes out from somewhere nearby.
N: She follows the sound...
0: 
N: ...and kneels down at a small brook. She cups her hands in
N: the water and lifts them to her lips to drink--
0: 
N: When Ryker suddenly SMACKS her hands away.
0: 
C:                            TIERNEY

D:              What are you doing?! That's hemlock
D:              silt!
0: 
N: He points-- the rocks in the stream are covered with ALGAE,
N: a green so bright it almost seems to glow.

N: He's holding her shroud in his hands, and now he thrusts it
N: at her. Looking around, anxious.

C:                            RYKER (cont'd)
D:                Put this on before someone sees you.
0: 
N: But Tierney picks up one of the algae-covered rocks.
N: Studying it up close. Something so familiar about it...
0: 
C:                            TIERNEY

C:                            RYKER
D:                It's-- I don't know, a fungus.
D:                Poisonous. It seeps into your mind.
D:                Even a drop on your tongue can
D:                incapacitate you for hours.
0: 
N: Off Tierney:   a dawning, dreadful realization...
0: 
C:                            TIERNEY
D:                And if you were drinking it by the

D:                The well in the Encampment is covered
D:                in this algae! It's the only water we
D:                have to drink! That's why the girls
D:                were acting crazy-- hallucinating and
D:                communing with nature and impervious
D:                to pain. I was, too. Seeing things,
D:                hearing things, that weren't really
D:                there. But it wasn't magic, it was

D:              with ghosts. We thought banishment
D:              from the County meant certain death.
E:                    (overcome)
D:              They let us think that we were

C:                          RYKER

0: 
C:                           TIERNEY
D:              To break us. To make us meek and

D:              themselves in power and keep us where
D:              we belong. And when they can't...

N: Her entire world has been dismantled. She is alone and in
N: shock. Feeling helpless and foolish and furious. She's
N: reached her lowest point. And then--
0: 
N: Slowly, deliberately, her hand goes to her hair. She pulls
N: the red ribbon from her braid and shakes her hair loose...
0: 
N: Letting it fall down her back... Running her fingers through

0: 
N: An act of defiance. An act of freedom.

N: Tierney rises. The pelts slip off her, revealing her BARE
N: SKIN underneath. She goes to him-- eyes locked on his.
N: Entirely naked and entirely unashamed.
0: 
N: She moves toward him-- like some invisible force is drawing
N: them together, and there's nothing they can do to fight it.
0: 
N: She lifts his shroud the way Michael once lifted her veil.
N: Claiming him.
0: 
C:                           RYKER (cont'd)
D:              Tierney...
0: 
N: Tierney runs her hands over the scar she gave him, up his
N: torso, across his chest...
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              This is my body. And my life. And I
D:              will do with it what I please.
0: 
N: She leans into him, cupping his jaw, pulling his face to
N: hers... They kiss. Long and deep and tender.
0: 
N: His arms wrap around her. Skimming over her back. Tangling
N: in her hair.
0: 
N: They melt into each other like they've spent their entire
N: lives missing a piece and now finally-- they are whole.
0: 0:                                                             82.
0: 
0: 
N: But it's more than just desire that's driving them. This is
N: an act of rebellion. Of revolution.
0: 
N: They sink down into the pelts, and the rest of the world
N: disappears. For this precious moment in time, there is
N: nothing but the HEAT of their breath and the RUSH of their
N: blood and the BEATING of their hearts...
0: 
0: 
N: LATER
0: 
N: Tierney and Ryker lie together under the pelts.
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              The moment I first saw you-- out on
D:              the ice... Wild and bleeding and half
D:              dead already. You looked so...
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Helpless?
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              Defiant. When you struck the ice with
D:              that axe... it was one of the bravest
D:              things I've ever seen. Everything you
D:              do is on your own terms. Even dying.
0: 
N: He looks at her now with a new expression. Admiration. Awe.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I think... this may be the first time
D:              I've ever seen you smile.
0: 
N: And just like that, his smile fades.
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              What are we doing? I'm a Poacher and
D:              you have a husband waiting for you--
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              As if I would ever go back there.
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              Won't you? You have a life, a family.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Will you? Can you stay a Poacher, now
D:              that you know the truth?
0: 
N: Ryker frowns. He can't. He is just as unmoored as she is.
0: 0:                                                             83.

0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              I could just stay here. Where things
D:              are simple. And I don't have to
D:              answer to anyone.
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              As long as you stay in hiding.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Then-- I'll leave. See what's out
D:              there beyond the forest. I can take
D:              care of myself.
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              I am well aware.
0: 
N: Ryker traces the long, jagged scar across her clavicle.
0: 
C:                          RYKER (cont'd)
D:              Last year a trapper brought us a
D:              message from a family we knew. They
D:              made it beyond the forest, over the
D:              mountains, to a settlement where men
D:              and women live side by side as
D:              equals. Where they're free.
0: 
N: Tierney considers. A future entirely of her own making...
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY
D:              Then that's it. That's what I'll do.
E:                    (beat)
D:              But there's something else I need to
D:              do first.
0: 
N: Ryker waits for her to elaborate. And then he realizes...
0: 
C:                           RYKER
D:              You're not serious. The Encampment?
D:              You can't go back there. They tried
D:              to kill you!
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              They didn't know what they were
D:              doing. They were out of their minds,
D:              just like I was.
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              You don't owe them anything.
0: 
N: But Tierney won't be swayed. She's made up her mind.
0: 0:                                                             84.
0: 
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              It's not about me. They deserve to
D:              know the truth.
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              You'll be alone in there against all
D:              of them. If they turn on you again...
0: 
N: Tierney gets up and takes a blade from a nearby table.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Then I'll be ready.

S: INT. FOREST - DAY
0: 
N: Tierney wears a Poacher's shroud as she navigates through
N: the trees, alone. Making her way to--
0: 
N: The high walls of the Grace Year Encampment. Looming over
N: her like some eerie fortress. No telling what awaits inside.
0: 
N: She tests the walls for weaknesses, making her way around to
N: the back... There. One of the fence posts is rotted. Tierney
N: gives it a KICK-- her foot goes right through. An opening.
0: 
N: With a little grunt work, she pries away just enough of the
N: fence to squeeze through...
0: 
N: She hesitates. Glancing back toward Ryker's hunting blind.
N: It's not too late. She could just turn back, walk away, wash
N: her hands of the whole thing. It would be so easy...
0: 
N: But instead, she slips inside...
0: 
0: 
S: INT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: Hiding among the trees, Tierney removes her shroud, folds it
N: up, and stuffs it in her dress.
0: 
N: She looks around. Takes a deep breath. And clutches Ryker's
N: blade, discreetly in one hand. Here goes nothing...
0: 
0: 
N: ON TIERNEY
0: 
N: She strides into the heart of the camp. Tense. Alert. Ready
N: for a fight. But completely unprepared for what she finds...
0: 
N: Now that she's clear-headed and healthy, whatever magical
N: veneer we once saw this place through is gone:
0: 0:                                                             85.
0: 
0: 
N: The place is a wreck. Pots and kettles piled next to the
N: fire, rotting food curdling at the bottom. Empty jars and
N: cans strewn about. Rats and roaches scuttling underfoot.
0: 
N: The limbs of the Punishment Tree hang heavy with new body
N: parts and braids. One girl stands next to a branch stroking
N: the long braid that used to be attached to her head.
0: 
N: Most girls pass her by without a second glance, looking
N: right through her with glassy eyes.
0: 
N: Like zombies lurching through some post-apocalyptic
N: wasteland.
0: 
N: Dena staggers over to her, covered in dirt and grime.
0: 
C:                          DENA
D:              I know you...
0: 
N: Dena reaches up...
0: 
N: --Tierney's grip tightens around her blade--
0: 
N: ...Dena simply scratches her head, pulling out a clump of
N: hair in the process. Then she simply staggers away.
0: 
N: Tierney shudders. She moves on. Walking slowly,
N: deliberately. Trying not to draw attention.
0: 
N: She opens the door to the--
0: 
0: 
S: INT. LODGE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: --and the STENCH of decay and disease knocks her back.
0: 
N: Girls like on cots, filthy and emaciated, barely breathing.
N: Some babble, eyes open, lost in a world of their own making.
0: 
N: Tierney searches their faces...
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY
D:              Gertie...?
0: 
N: Suddenly a HAND GRABS her ankle from under a bed.
0: 
N: Tierney SCREAMS-- SLASHING at the air with the blade--
0: 
N: But the girl peeks out from under the bed. It's HANNAH, with
N: a puckered SCAR where one eye used to be.
0: 
C:                          HANNAH
D:              Shhhh... you'll wake the ghosts.

0: 
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Hannah? What happened to you?
0: 
N: Hannah grins maniacally.
0: 
C:                          HANNAH
D:              I see them now. They're everywhere.
D:              All around us. I had to take out my
D:              eye to make it stop. But Gertie...
D:              they took her to the larder.
0: 
C:                            TIERNEY
D:              What? Why?
0: 
C:                          HANNAH
D:              Gertie was too dirty.
0: 
N: Hannah's body shakes. Is she laughing or crying? Maybe both.
0: 
N: Tierney backs away, uneasy. Feeling an increasing sense of
N: urgency and dread...
0: 
N: She hurries out of the lodge house--
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: --heading for the larder. Moving fast, no concern for who
N: might see her. She pries the door open...
0: 
N: And a SWARM OF FLIES comes pouring out. But she pushes
N: through them to find--

0: 
S: INT. LARDER - CONTINUOUS
0: 
C:                            TIERNEY
D:              Gertie?!
0: 
N: Gertrude is laying on a cot piled high with ratty blankets.
N: A bucket of bile on the floor beside her.
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
E:                    (faint; weak)
D:              ...Tierney? Is that you...?
0: 
N: Tierney rushes to her. Lifting her up.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              It's me. I'm here. There's so much I
D:              need to tell you--
0: 0:                                                            87.
0: 
0: 
N: But Gertrude RETCHES into the bucket on the floor. She's
N: bone thin, her skin gray. The WOUND where Kiersten scalped
N: her is gooey and festering. It's a miracle she's even alive.
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              I can't... keep anything down...
0: 
N: Tierney gently presses the swollen flesh around the wound.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Does this hurt?
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              No, but... I think I lost my braid.
0: 
N: Tierney grimaces. She doesn't remember.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Don't worry. You're going to be
D:              alright--
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (O.S.)
D:              Where is she?
0: 
N: Tierney stiffens. She pulls a blanket over Gertrude and
N: stands up. Gertrude whimpers, but reassures her.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              It's okay. I'll be right back.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: Tierney emerges from the larder. Every muscle tensed. Blade
N: bared for all to see. And there she is:
0: 
N: Kiersten. Her skin sallow, her cheeks sunken, her hair
N: matted, her eyes completely black. Clutching the rusty axe.
N: Girls buzzing around her like flies.
0: 
N: Not some all-powerful mage, but still-- no less of a threat.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              We need firewood.
0: 
N: And yet, she has lost her spark, her fire. Her tone is flat,
N: emotionless; her gaze unfocused. She doesn't even seem to
N: notice Tierney's blade. The effects of prolonged poisoning.
0: 
N: And Tierney realizes-- Kiersten doesn't remember either.
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY
D:              Alright...

0: 
0: 
N: Tierney reaches for the axe... But Kiersten pulls back.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              Hold on. You're not allowed to take
D:              out your braid unless you've embraced
D:              your magic.
0: 
N: Other girls close in. Sensing a confrontation. Tierney
N: thinks on her feet... How to diffuse this...?
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              But I have. You helped me. Remember?
0: 
N: Kiersten's eyes narrow. Suspicious.
0: 
N: Tierney looks at these girls. Starving, sick, completely
N: untethered from reality. No idea what they're capable of.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              You dared me to go into the woods. I
D:              was lost-- for a long time...
0: 
N: There are so many of them. She is overpowered, surrounded.
N: Her paltry blade looks ridiculous. No way she can win this
N: fight. What was she thinking? This was such a mistake--
0: 
N: But that's when one of the other girls pipes up:
0: 
C:                          RACHEL
D:              You survived the woods? The ghosts?
0: 
N: That's it. Tierney starts to form a new plan... Maybe she
N: can't outmatch them, but she can still outwit them.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Yes. The ghosts-- they spoke to me...
D:              saved me... They led me to a spring
D:              in the woods. Full of special water.
D:              I was sick, but the water healed me.
0: 
N: The girls murmur among themselves. Looking to Kiersten for
N: guidance. Kiersten herself seems to be plotting. Finally--
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              Prove it.

S: EXT. FOREST - DAY
0: 
N: Tierney, wearing her shroud, carries a bucket of water
N: toward the Encampment. She's about to reach the main gate--
0: 
N: When ANOTHER POACHER emerges from the trees up ahead.
0: 0:                                                            89.
0: 
0: 
C:                           POACHER
D:              Hey!
0: 
N: We recognize his voice. It's the Poacher who came to check
N: on Ryker that day. Anders.
0: 
N: Tierney freezes. Heart pounding in her ears. Using every
N: ounce of willpower not to break into a run.
0: 
C:                          ANDERS
D:              What are you doing?
0: 
N: He's coming toward her now. What is she going to do??
N: Tierney thinks fast...
0: 
N: She raises a finger to her lips. Shhh. And she points down
N: at the ground--
0: 
N: Tracks. Footprints leading from the Encampment down to the
N: lake. Fresh. Because they're hers.
0: 
N: Anders perks. He pulls out a blade.
0: 
N: Tierney gestures:   Around the side.
0: 
N: Anders nods. He slinks back into the trees, following the
N: tracks. Tierney stays frozen, listening to the sound of his
N: footsteps receding...
0: 
N: CRUNCH... CRUNCH... CRUNCH...
0: 
N: And when the sound fades out, she RUNS for the gate.
0: 
0: 
S: EXT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: She stays there for a moment. Leaning against the gate until
N: her heart stops racing, her hands stop shaking.
0: 
N: That was close.
0: 
N: She takes off the shroud, folds it up, and knocks on the
N: gate...
0: 
0: 
S: INT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: The girls let her in, wide-eyed. Kiersten inspects the water.
0: 
C:                           KIERSTEN
D:              You first.
0: 
N: Tierney dutifully takes a sip of water.
0: 0:                                                             90.

C:                          TIERNEY
D:              See? It's good.
0: 
N: Kiersten glares; but she doesn't push back. The girls CLOSE
N: IN, eager to drink-- but Tierney stops them.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              The ghosts gave me this. They said
D:              you can have one sip each, for now.
D:              The rest is for supper.
0: 
N: The girls quickly form a line, eager to please the ghosts.
0: 
N: Tierney helps them each take a sip. But she also keeps a
N: close eye on Kiersten-- who is watching from the sidelines,
N: pacing like a tiger in a cage...

C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              I never told you the truth... about
D:              what really happened with Kiersten...
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              You don't owe me an explanation--
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              No, I-- I want to. I need to.
0: 
N: Gertrude takes a deep breath. As if this is something she
N: has been holding in for a long time.

C:                          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
D:              When she showed me the lithograph, I
D:              thought she was trying to tell me
D:              something, give me some kind of sign.
D:              So-- I kissed her. Like we'd done a
D:              dozen times before. I wasn't asking her
D:              to do those things in the lithograph.
D:              It wasn't dirty. I'm not dirty. I was
D:              just trying to tell her...
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              That you loved her.
0: 
N: Gertrude relaxes. She can sense it; this time, Tierney truly
N: does understand.
0: 
N: Gertrude starts drifting off to sleep...

D:              It can wait. Get some rest.

N: Tierney gets up, tucks the blankets tightly around Gertrude.
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              Tierney... it's like you're back from

N: She pulls off the shroud and Ryker is waiting with open
N: arms. She sinks into him. Physically and emotionally
N: exhausted. Letting the horrors of the day wash over her.

C:                          TIERNEY
D:              There's no getting through to them
D:              like this. They need time to get the
D:              poison out. To heal. So they can
D:              really understand.

C:                          RYKER

N: SERIES OF SHOTS
0: 
N: As Tierney takes control of the Encampment...
0: 
N: --Near the Punishment Tree, Tierney doles out stew. She
N: gestures for the girls to form a line, and they meekly obey.
0: 
N: --At the well, Tierney cuts the rope and drops the bucket
N: down into the well. No more poison water. The other girls
N: watch, murmuring angrily. But they don't try to stop her.
0: 
N: --In the larder, Tierney organizes the food that hasn't
N: spoiled. Two other girls enter, volunteering to help.
0: 
N: --In the lodge house, Tierney supervises a dozen girls as
N: they beat mattresses, sweep away the filth, and rearrange
N: the beds into uniform rows.
0: 
N: --Around the campfire, the other girls settle around
N: Tierney, orbiting her like the sun. Only Kiersten continues
N: to keep her distance. Watching, waiting to strike.
0: 
N: --By the gates, Tierney brings fresh berries from the
N: forest. The girls flock to her, excited. Kiersten approaches
N: and pops a berry into her mouth with a little smirk. Now
N: that she's getting healthy, her spark is back. Which makes
N: her more dangerous than ever.

N: --And back in the hunting blind, Tierney stretches out in
N: front of the fire with Ryker as night settles in...

D:              ...leaving soon.

D:              Tomorrow, when the sun sets, go down
D:              to the lake, take one of the canoes.
D:              I'll cover you.
0: 
N: Tierney nods. Energized and overwhelmed... and guilty.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Do you think they'll be alright?
0: 
N: Ryker hears the tension in her voice, and the unspoken
N: question beneath her words: Will you be alright?
0: 
N: He goes to her, wraps her in his arms.
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              That's up to them. Either way, it's
D:              not your problem anymore.
0: 
N: Tierney leans into him. Feeling safe and secure and loved.
N: And here in this moment-- she makes a decision.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Come with me.

D:              You're sure...?
0:

N: she's not afraid to ask for it.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I'm sure.
0: 
N: Ryker reaches under the bed and pulls out-- his own pack and
N: bedroll. Ready to go.

N: Tierney cleans and dresses Gertrude's wound. The infection
N: is almost gone. She keeps one eye on the open door--
N: outside, the sun is just beginning to set.
0: 
C:                          GERTRUDE
D:              You're different today.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              There's something... I need to ask
D:              you. A favor.
0: 
N: Her hands are trembling. Gertrude notices. This is serious.
0: 
C:                            GERTRUDE
D:              Anything.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Will you tell Michael... I'm sorry.
0: 
N: Gertrude looks surprised... and then solemn. She understands.
0: 
C:                           GERTRUDE
D:              You have my word.

D:              You're leaving?
0: 
N: Tierney nods. Fighting tears. And to her surprise--
0: 
N: Gertrude HUGS her. And Tierney hugs her right back. They
N: stay that way, locked in an embrace.

N: The sky is a brilliant orange as the girls sit around the
N: campfire eating their evening meal. The girls are noticeably
N: different. Stronger, clear-eyed.
0: 
N: They perk at A RUSTLING in the forest beyond the fence.
N: Hannah tilts her empty eye socket toward the sound.

C:                          HANNAH

0: 
0: 
N: But Tierney is distant, distracted. Gertrude gently nudges
N: her-- and she realizes everyone is waiting for her to answer.
0: 
C:                             TIERNEY
D:              ...What?

D:              The ghosts.

D:              Oh. I don't know...
0: 
N: But that's when Jenna pipes up.
0: 
C:                          JENNA
D:              I do. They talk to me now. Ever since
D:              I started drinking the ghost water.
0: 
N: Tierney frowns.
0: 
C:                             TIERNEY
D:              That's not--
0: 
C:                          RACHEL
D:              Me too. I hear them.
0: 
C:                          DENA
D:              So do I! It's part of my magic--
0: 
N: Finally Tierney has had enough.
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY
D:              Nobody hears them. Not even me.
E:                    (beat)
D:              Look, there's something I need to
D:              tell you. Something I need you to
D:              really hear. It's important. And--
D:              it's the truth.
0: 
N: She has them rapt. She takes a deep breath. This is it:
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              The ghosts aren't real. And neither
D:              is magic.
0: 
N: The other girls give a collective gasp. What Tierney's
N: saying is blasphemy. But she keeps going. She pulls an
N: algae-covered rock from her coat pocket and tosses it into
N: the center of the circle for all to see.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              It's the well water. The algae-- it's
D:              hemlock silt.

0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              That's what's been making you see
D:              things and hear things and feel
D:              things that aren't real. It's poison.
0: 
N: The girls begin to murmur with unease.
0: 
C:                             JESSICA
D:              But--
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              And it's deliberate. We're made to
D:              think we have this power inside us to
D:              make us easier to control. We're made
D:              to think there are ghosts haunting
D:              these woods when really it's just
D:              men. Men our own County have bought
D:              and paid to slaughter us if we step
D:              out of line. I know because I met
D:              one-- out there in the forest. He
D:              found me, took care of me. He's the
D:              reason I stayed alive.
0: 
N: And now Tierney reveals-- the SHROUD she carries with her.
0: 
N: Gertrude's face twists with revulsion. Shock. Horror. And
N: she's not alone. Tierney's words are hitting home. Until--
0: 
N: Kiersten stands up. No more lying in wait. She's finally
N: making her move.
0: 
C:                             KIERSTEN
D:              She's lying.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              No, I'm not--
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              Men or ghosts, it doesn't matter. The
D:              magic is real. We've all felt it. And
D:              I'm going to prove it. And when I do,
D:              we will cut out your heretic tongue
D:              once and for all.
0: 
N: Kiersten gets up and strides toward the gate. The other
N: girls quickly follow. She yanks open the gate and steps over
N: the threshold into the forest.
0: 
C:                          JENNA
D:              What are you doing?!
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              It's fine. No harm will come to me.
D:              Watch.

0: 
0: 
N: Kiersten keeps going. Gaining confidence with every stride.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              Nothing can touch me. My magic
D:              forbids it. Join me and you'll see.
0: 
N: Jenna and Jessica tentatively step over the threshold...
0: 
N: When a FIGURE appears steps out of the brush up ahead.
0: 
N: A POACHER. Anders.
0: 
N: The other girls freeze. They rush back into the Encampment.
N: But Kiersten just laughs.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              Don't worry. If it's just a man under
D:              that shroud as Tierney claims, he'll
D:              be powerless to act against my will.
0: 
N: Kiersten takes another step forward. As if taunting him.
0: 
N: Anders stands there, considering. Then he draws a knife. And
N: strides toward her.
0: 
N: Tierney pushes her way to the front.
0: 
C:                             TIERNEY
D:              Kiersten...
0: 
N: Kiersten's smile begins to waver, but she stands her ground.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              That's as close as my magic will
D:              allow. Watch.
0: 
N: But Anders keeps coming. And TWO MORE POACHERS emerge from
N: the brush, flanking him.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              Stop. I command you.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              Kiersten-- run!
0: 
N: Kiersten turns to look back at the Encampment-- a glimmer of
N: real FEAR in her eyes. But--
0: 
N: Other girls SHRIEK as TWO MORE POACHERS emerge from around
N: the sides of the Encampment. Forming a circle. Knives drawn.
0: 
C:                             KIERSTEN
D:              I said stop!

0: 
0: 
N: But they keep closing in. And we watch Kiersten's face as--
0: 
N: Realization finally washes over her. And with it... terror.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              We need to help her! We need to-- do
D:              something!
0: 
N: But the other girls are frozen in fear. Tierney spies THE
N: AXE near the door. She grabs it and CHARGES out SWINGING--
0: 
N: The Poachers hesitate. Giving her a wide berth. Allowing her
N: to catch up with Kiersten--
0: 
N: Before they close ranks again. Now Tierney is trapped in the
N: middle too. Kiersten looks at her, trembling.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              I don't understand...
0: 
N: Tierney raises the axe. Bracing for a fight.
0: 
N: For a moment, she LOCKS EYES with one of the Poachers in the
N: circle. It's Ryker-- looking frantic and terrified. What are
N: they supposed to do now??
0: 
N: Slowly, calmly, Ryker steps into the circle.
0: 
C:                          ANDERS
D:              What are you doing?!
0: 
C:                          RYKER
D:              Listen to me. There is no magic. It's
D:              all a lie. They're just girls.
D:              They're sick and they're scared, but
D:              they aren't dangerous. I promise.
0: 
N: The Poachers pause. Taking this in. For a moment, it seems
N: like they might actually stand down...
0: 
N: And then ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
0: 
N: A Poacher LUNGES at Tierney-- his blade slices into
N: Tierney's heavy COAT and--
0: 
N: THWACK! Ryker strikes-- burying his blade in the Poacher's
N: back. The Poacher stumbles forward, gurgling blood.
0: 
N: Anders and the others gape at Ryker with shock.
0: 
N: Ryker turns to Tierney-- a hundred emotions stirring in
N: those dark eyes.

C:                          TIERNEY
D:              No--!
0: 
N: Too late. Anders and the Poachers turn on Ryker. Swarming
N: him. He draws a pair of blades to meet their attack...
0: 
N: But the odds are against him. The Poachers' blades flash and
N: Ryker disappears from view. Swallowed up by their shrouds.
0: 
N: Kiersten cowers behind Tierney and her axe as Tierney howls--
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              Stop it!!
0: 
N: But they don't stop. Not until it's over.
0: 
N: The Poachers step away. There's blood on their blades, blood
N: on their shrouds, and Ryker's body broken on the ground.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              You killed him. How could you?! He
D:              was one of you!
0: 
N: The Poachers stagger back. Dazed. One of them pulls off his
N: shroud and VOMITS on the ground. And with his face revealed
N: we see-- he's just a boy.
0: 
N: Then they all remove their shrouds. Facing the terrible
N: truth of what they've done...
0: 
N: But then Anders's face twists into a SNEER. Pointing his
N: bloody blade at Tierney and Kiersten.
0: 
C:                          ANDERS
D:              No. No-- you did this.
0: 
N: Kiersten huddles against Tierney, who stares back at Anders
N: defiantly. Clearly just two scared, defenseless girls.
0: 
N: And finally-- one of the other Poachers forces his arm down.
0: 
C:                          ANDERS
D:              It's not our fault! They made us do it.
D:              With their magic. We had no choice!
0: 
N: But the other Poachers lead him away. Slinking back into the
N: forest in shame.
0: 
N: And Tierney leads Kiersten back to...
0: 0:                                                           101.

D:              It was all... a lie...?
0: 
N: Tierney is in shock. Her ears RING, her vision BLURS.
N: Everything is a haze...
0: 
N: She drops the axe. Feeling lost and alone and utterly
N: hopeless. Everything has gone so terribly wrong...
0: 
N: The other girls stand there in stunned silence. Their entire
N: worldview has just been shattered. Ghosts aren't real. Magic
N: isn't real. Everything they've been taught is a lie. Where
N: can they possibly go from here...?

N: coat. A blow that surely would have killed her. She touches
N: the hole-- and frowns. Feeling something unexpected...
0: 
N: A SEED. She rolls it between her fingers. A memory forming--

D:              Tierney. What are we supposed to do?
0: 
N: And that's when Tierney realizes-- ALL THE GIRLS are looking
N: at her. Desperate for guidance. For a leader.
0: 
N: And we see the shifting expression on Tierney's face:
0: 
N: Resignation. That she will never escape and start over with
N: a new life. And then... Resolve.
0: 
N: Tierney sloughs off her coat. She grabs the torn fabric in
N: the side and RIPS--
0: 
N: DOZENS OF SEEDS spill out onto the earth.
0:

0: 
0: 
S: EXT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: And it is a world transformed.
0: 
N: An elaborate IRRIGATION SYSTEM of tree bark pipes channels

0:

N: covered area for cooking.
0: 
N: The well has been boarded over, the word POISON scorched
N: into the planks for good measure.
0: 
N: Trees in the back of the camp have been cut and cleared to
N: make room for a massive garden. Pumpkins. Tomatoes. Celery.
N: Carrots. Potatoes. Peas.
0: 
N: In the lodge house, the beds are set in a circle with clean
N: sheets and newly sewn-and-stuffed mattresses.
0: 
N: And THE GIRLS themselves are healthy and strong-- and hard
N: at work. Cleaning the privy. Organizing the larder. Washing
N: clothes and picking vegetables and cooking a feast.

0: 
0: 
N: THWACK!
0:

N: Tree. Then she pries the axe free and turns to--
0: 
N: A line of girls each waiting for their turn.
0: 
N: THWACK! One by one, the girls each take a swing.
0: 
N: THWACK! Channeling all their sadness and rage and guilt.
0: 
N: THWACK! Braids, toes, fingers, teeth rattling until--
0:

N: Happy. Harmonious. Free.
0: 
N: Snug in her coat, Tierney smiles to herself. And for just a

0:

D:              us, together. I want to believe that

0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              You're right. It's about all of us.

N: through the line of Grace Year girls...

0: 
N: And Tierney realizes-- this is it. She's run out of time.
N: Just like Michael, always ruining her plans.
0: 
N: She steps forward. She unbuttons her heavy coat and lets it
N: fall to the ground.
0: 
N: Gasps of shock. Cries of outrage. Michael RECOILS. Because--
0: 
N: Tierney is visibly pregnant.
0: 
N: Her hands are shaking as she raises her chin to face the

C:                           TIERNEY
D:              I wasn't.
0: 
N: His face twists, new anger burning in his eyes. He spits the
N: words out like they're bitter to taste--

C:                          MICHAEL
D:              How could you-- betray me--?
0:

0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              How could I? How could you?! You knew

0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              So you did this, what? Out of spite?
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              No. It wasn't about you at all. It
D:              was about me.
0: 
N: Michael glares.

D:              A what?
0: 
N: Tierney studies his face, but Michael appears genuinely
N: confused. He doesn't know the truth about this place.

N: Tierney looks away.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              It doesn't matter. He's dead.
0: 
N: And at that, Michael finally brightens.
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              Then lie. Tell the Council this man
D:              forced himself on you. Or-- or your
D:              magic made you do it. They'll show
D:              compassion, I know they will--
E:                    (off her reaction)
D:              Tierney, you're going to hang.
0: 
N: Tierney doesn't answer.
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL (cont'd)
D:              What's wrong with you? The Tierney I
D:              know is a fighter, not a martyr.
0: 
N: And at that, Tierney laughs. Bitter and cynical.
0: 
C:                           TIERNEY
D:              The Tierney you know? You have no
D:              idea what I've been through. The
D:              things I've seen... the things I've
D:              done... You don't even know what's
D:              happening in this County, right here
D:              under your nose.
E:                    (cold)
D:              The Tierney you know died out there
D:              in the forest. You don't know me at
D:              all anymore.
0: 
N: Michael wilts. No idea what to say to that.
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              Maybe I don't.
0: 
N: And with that, Michael slinks out.
0: 
N: Tierney slumps back. Leaning her head against the wall. A

D:              I have nothing else to say to you...

D:              understand is how you live with

S: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT - PAST
0: 
N: Tierney stumbles through the trees. Up ahead-- A light.
N: Shifting, stretching, dancing with a fluid grace.
0: 
N: A BONFIRE.
0: 
N: Around it-- movement. Figures forming a circle. Tierney
N: moves into the clearing to find--
0: 
N: Women. Their hair loose and wild, their dresses unbuttoned
N: and unlaced, their feet bare on soft ground that is
N: blanketed with tiny red flowers. And one of them is--
0: 
N: The Woman from her dreams. But there is nothing frightening
N: or sinister about her. She radiates joy and love.

D:              Mommy?
0: 
N: Her Mother spots her. Lifts her up and nuzzles her. And then
N: they see--
0: 
N: A different kind of light shining through the trees. And
N: another. And another. Orbs of light floating in the
N: darkness, completely surrounding them:
0: 
N: Lanterns. They've been caught.

C:                          ABE

D:              if she said she bewitched the others

S: EXT. TOWN - SUNRISE - PAST
0: 
N: We're knee-high in a crowd of people. Scanning faces,
N: desperately searching--
0: 
N: We push through to the front-- to see THE WOMAN standing on
N: a rolling staircase under the Punishment Tree with a noose
N: around her neck. And now we know-- it's TIERNEY'S MOTHER.
0: 
N: A group of men stand at the base of the tree-- THE COUNCIL.
N: Tierney's Father, ten years younger, joins them. The Head of
N: the Council, MR. WELK (Michael's Father) addresses the crowd.
0: 
C:                          MR. WELK
D:              Ruth James. You stand accused of
D:              harboring your magic. Your own husband

0: 
N: But Tierney's Mother doesn't wait. She shocks them all by
N: stepping off the ledge.
0: 
N: The rope pulls taut. Her neck snaps. Her body convulses. And
N: her hands fall open to reveal--
0: 
N: A TINY RED FLOWER in one palm. It falls drops to the ground
N: beneath her feet.

D:              started. And pick up where she left

E:                    (ashamed)
D:              I'm sorry. I'm sorry-- for all of it.

D:              here I am. Just like her in the end.

S: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

N: The town is gathered to watch as Guards lead Tierney to:
0: 
N: THE PUNISHMENT TREE. A noose hangs from its thickest branch,
N: the gallows below.
0: 
N: They force her up the steps, tighten the noose around her
N: neck. She's just like her mother, looking down on the crowd.
0: 
N: The Council in the first row. The Grace Year girls scattered
N: throughout the crowd, standing with their families, or their
N: new husbands, or their respective labor houses.
0: 
N: And there is her Father. He's left Penny and Clara at home.

D:              fornication. What do you have to say
D:              for yourself?
0:

N: that gripped her yesterday.
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY
D:              I only have one thing to say. And
D:              that's-- the truth.
0: 
N: So much for her Father's plea...?
0: 
N: She looks at the other Grace Year girls. At Michael. At her
N: Father. The men of the Council. The faces in the crowd...
0: 
N: And she gives a little GASP of surprise as she notices--
0: 
N: Everywhere, all throughout the crowd, are flashes of red:
0: 
N: A tiny red flower under one woman's apron bib. Beneath the
N: ruffle of a dress. Pinned to a collar. Threaded in a braid.
N: Tucked behind an ear.
0: 
N: It is a red wave. A united front of silent, secret
N: solidarity. And it is proof--
0: 
N: That Tierney is not alone in this fight. Her mother's
N: revolution lives on.
0: 
N: And she's ready to join it. She takes a deep breath:
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
D:              It's Michael's baby.
0: 
N: The crowd murmurs. Her Father nods encouragement. (Aha,
N: she's taking his advice after all.) Michael frowns. Mr. Welk
N: just laughs.

C:                          MR. WELK
D:              Michael hasn't set foot outside the

0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN
D:              I have something to say, if the
D:              Council will allow it.
0: 
N: Tierney's heart sinks. This girl has spent an entire year
N: plotting to destroy her. And now she finally has her chance.
0: 
N: Mr. Welk brightens. He knows Kiersten has more ill-will
N: toward Tierney than anyone. He gestures for her to continue.
0: 
N: Kiersten looks up at Tierney with cold, hard eyes. They both
N: know Tierney's life is in her hands. And then--
0: 
N: She turns to address the crowd.
0: 
C:                          KIERSTEN (cont'd)
D:              What Tierney says is true. We all
D:              witnessed it. The baby is Michael's.
0: 
N: Tierney is stunned. What...? But Kiersten glances back at
N: her-- with that little spark in her eye. They share a common
N: enemy far greater than their own rivalry.
0: 
C:                          MR. WELK
E:                    (incredulous)
D:              You don't expect us to believe that--

N: But then Gertrude steps forward.

D:              She had the strongest magic of all of
D:              us.
0: 
N: The other girls step forward now. All vouching for Tierney.
0: 
N: Tierney now turns her gaze to Michael. Challenging him.
N: Imploring him. He looks up at her-- pain and anger and
N: humiliation etched across his face...
0: 
C:                          MR. WELK
D:              Enough of this. Tierney James, on
D:              behalf of God and the chosen men--
0: 
N: But Michael turns away from his Father, to the crowd--
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL
D:              Yes. The child is mine. I commanded
D:              her to do it.
E:                          (MORE)

C:                          MICHAEL (cont'd)
D:              I didn't want to wait an entire year.
D:              If you need to punish someone, punish
D:              me.
E:                    (to Tierney)
D:              I was selfish. And I'm sorry.
0: 
N: It's a genuine apology. A glimpse of the boy she knew
N: before. And a promise of the man he'll be in the future.
0: 
C:                          MR. WELK
D:              Michael, don't be a fool...

C:                           TIERNEY
D:              Are you calling us liars? All of us?
D:              My magic was powerful, Mr. Welk. Just
D:              like my mother's. And if you don't
D:              believe that, maybe you'd like to
D:              explain why.
0: 
N: There it is. The threat. Let her live; or reveal the truth.
0: 
N: Mr. Welk stares Tierney dead in the eyes. Hatred pouring out
N: of him. But there's a deeper emotion behind it as well.
N: Fear. The fear that he might be losing control.
0: 
N: He's in a no-win situation. And they both know it.
0: 
N: And that makes Mr. Welk FURIOUS. With a ROAR, he CHARGES the
N: gallows-- SHOVING it aside--
0: 
N: Tierney PLUMMETS-- The rope pulls TAUT-- The crowd GASPS--
0: 
C:                           MICHAEL
D:              Tierney--!
0: 
N: And yet...
0: 
N: Tierney lives. As fourteen pairs of hands hold her up.
0: 
N: The Grace Year girls stand together. Supporting her.
N: Protecting her. A show of solidarity unlike anything this
N: town has ever seen. Tierney is an outsider no more.
0: 
N: They remove the noose from her neck; help her to her feet.
0: 
N: Mr. Welk moves toward her-- but Michael intervenes.
0: 
C:                          MICHAEL (cont'd)
D:              Careful, Father. That's my wife.
0: 
N: Michael gives Tierney a nod. A gesture of support. He is
N: here for her, no matter what.

0: 
N: Mr. Welk looks past them all to Tierney. He growls low:
0: 
C:                          MR. WELK
D:              This isn't over.
0: 
N: Tierney holds his gaze, and then bows her head demurely. She
N: will play this game... and she will win.
0: 
N: Tierney moves into the crowd. The other Grace Year girls
N: following behind her. And now we PAN OUT--
0: 
N: Past the town...

C:                          TIERNEY (V.O.)
D:              They're right to fear us.

C:                          TIERNEY (V.O.) (cont'd)
D:              And it has nothing to do with magic.

N: And into the Encampment...

C:                          TIERNEY (V.O.) (cont'd)
D:              Our strength lies in each other.

S: INT. ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: ...where the new group of Grace Year Girls are crowded
N: around the larder, reading the NOTE that Tierney left them:
0: 
C:                          TIERNEY (V.O.)
D:              The Grace Year was meant to break us,
D:              but you can take it back. Let it be
D:              your sanctuary. Your shelter. And
D:              your proving ground. And when you
D:              return-- you too can join the fight.
0: 
N: The girls look at each other. Revolution brewing in their
N: eyes. And just beyond them, at their feet--
