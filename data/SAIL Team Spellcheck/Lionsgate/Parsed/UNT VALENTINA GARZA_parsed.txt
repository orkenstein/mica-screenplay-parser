M: VOICE (O.S.)
M: Please! ...Don‚Äôt!
N: Through a smokey haze we FADE UP ON a pair of eyes, tearful and frightened. They reflect the orange glow of a fire. Slowly, we PULL BACK, REVEALING --
S: 1 EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - DAY (FBD1) 1
N: -- A distraught Latina girl, YOUNG NATALIA (10). Don‚Äôt worry, she‚Äôs not being burned at the stake, but she is horrified. CHYRON: ‚Äú1992‚Äù We continue PULLING BACK to include Natalia‚Äôs mom, CORA NIEVES (40s), clearly manic, on the other side of the smoldering pyre. She tosses a teddy bear into the fire. Natalia‚Äôs face crumples as she watches it melt grotesquely.
C: YOUNG NATALIA
D: Mami, stop!
N: But Cora herself is a consuming fire -- raging as she makes kindling out of Natalia‚Äôs birthday gifts.
C: CORA
D: He thinks he can leave you then buy you back?! No, no, no.
C: YOUNG NATALIA
D: They‚Äôre mine! He brought them for me!
N: Cora tosses a gift box into the flames as Natalia‚Äôs Afro- Cuban half-siblings, ENZO (20) and ADELE (19), walk up. Enzo, kind and loyal, assesses the situation. He drops the cake he‚Äôs holding and runs to Natalia.
C: ENZO
D: Are you okay? What happened?
C: YOUNG NATALIA
D: My dad dropped off some presents, but he and Mom got in a fight and now she‚Äôs burning everything. I hate her! I can‚Äôt wait to grow up and get far away from her!
N: (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 2. 1 CONTINUED: 1 Natalia sobs, but there‚Äôs no time for comfort. Enzo grabs a nearby hose and douses the fire. ANGLE ON Adele, a bit of bulldozer, confronting Cora.
C: ADELE
D: Are you trying to get kicked out again? Think of Natalia for once.
C: CORA
D: Her dad won‚Äôt turn her against me!
C: ADELE
D: No, you‚Äôre doing a great job of that all by yourself.
N: The fire is out now. Enzo walks up, tries to keep the peace.
C: ENZO
D: Calm down, Del.
C: ADELE
D: Calm down?! She is burning shit!
C: ENZO
D: You yelling isn‚Äôt going to help!
C: ADELE
D: Hold up. I am not the problem here. You know what -- whatever. Happy birthday, Nati. I‚Äôm out.
E: to Natalia
N: She storms off. Cora calls after her, furious:
C: CORA
D: Go! You‚Äôre no good to me anyway!
N: As Enzo grabs Cora‚Äôs arm, Natalia pulls a small box from the smoldering embers. She opens it and finds a gold necklace with a heart charm inside. As she takes in the gift, full of unknowable emotions, MATCH TO --
S: 2 INT. PAREDES BATHROOM - PRESENT DAY (D1) 2
N: -- The necklace. NATALIA (38) fiddles with the charm, no longer a child. She‚Äôs a woman in charge. We hear it in her voice as she FaceTimes with her contractor, LUIS (40s).
C: NATALIA
D: No. Two modern farmhouses. Three if we can subdivide the lot further.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
N: Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 3.
S: 3 EXT. EMPTY LOT - DAY (D1) 3
N: Luis, glancing around the lot.
C: LUIS
D: There may be room if you go up.
C: NATALIA
D: Oh, we‚Äôre going up. Those views are money. Call the city and find out about any zoning restrictions.
N: There‚Äôs a knock at the bathroom door. Natalia‚Äôs husband, HUGO (30s), charming and steadfast, enters with their teary-eyed daughter, LUNA (12), an old soul (wearing a choir uniform).
C: NATALIA
D: Just a sec, Luis.
E: CONT'D
N: She mutes the call and turns to Luna.
C: NATALIA
D: What‚Äôs up?
E: CONT'D
C: LUNA
D: ‚ÄòIta Lydia tried to untangle my hair and now the brush is stuck!
N: Luna turns around REVEALING a brush dangling from her matted curls. Natalia‚Äôs mother-in-law, LYDIA PAREDES (50s), appears at the door. She looks contrite.
C: LYDIA
D: Sorry. I raised two boys, I‚Äôm not good with girl curls.
C: NATALIA
D: Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve got it.
E: unruffled
N: Relieved, Hugo exits, closing the door. Natalia sets her phone on the vanity, rifles through a drawer for detangler and a comb, then calmly fixes Luna‚Äôs hair.
C: NATALIA
D: Okay, can you also get a soil report? I want to make sure there‚Äôs no erosion on that hill.
E: CONT'D unmuting call
C: LUIS
D: Yep. Does that mean you‚Äôre ready to pull the trigger?
N: (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 4. 3 CONTINUED: 3
C: NATALIA
D: I don‚Äôt want to be hasty or emotional about this. That‚Äôs how you make bad investments. I‚Äôll check out a few more properties but right now, I‚Äôve got to go.
N: She hangs up and turns Luna to face the mirror.
C: NATALIA
D: There. Nice and tidy.
E: CONT'D
N: Luna looks at her expertly styled hair and smiles but --
S: 4 INT. PAREDES KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER (D1) 4
N: -- her brother, MAX (8), is anything but tidy as he slurps spaghetti beside his ruggedly handsome grandfather, JOAQUIN PAREDES (50s), at the counter. As Lydia clears some dishes:
C: MAX
D: Do I have to eat the salad?
C: LYDIA
D: Yes.
N: Lydia crosses to the sink and quickly Joaquin dumps the contents of Max‚Äôs salad plate onto his own, wink wink. Max smiles but Lydia has eyes in the back of her head.
C: LYDIA
D: And don‚Äôt you dare help him, Joaquin. ...Sebastian, you sure you‚Äôre good?
E: CONT'D
N: Hugo‚Äôs flake of a brother, SEBASTIAN PAREDES (30s), is at the other end of the counter playing a game on his phone.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I had a burger in the car.
C: MAX
D: No fair!
N: Hugo enters straightening his tie and crosses to Sebastian.
C: HUGO
D: Okay, fired off my last email. You‚Äôd think after all these years I would‚Äôve made peace with being a cog in a corporate wheel, but nope.
C: JOAQUIN
D: You don‚Äôt have to be, you know...
N: (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 5. 4 CONTINUED: 4 Hugo reads into the comment. For some reason, it annoys him.
C: HUGO
D: Don‚Äôt start, Dad.
N: Joaquin shrugs, ‚Äújust saying.‚Äù
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Well, if life as a highfalutin architect is too hard you can try teaching English lit to a bunch of horny high schoolers while your eyes water from their cumulative pubescent stench.
C: HUGO
D: Okay, you win the crappy job contest. Is Trixie coming to the concert?
E: then
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I might‚Äôve forgotten to mention it.
C: HUGO
D: Has it been six months already?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You go too long after that, women start getting ‚Äúexpectations.‚Äù
E: pocketing his cell
N: Hugo shakes his head at Sebastian as Natalia and Luna enter.
C: HUGO
D: Well hello, gorgeous!
E: off Luna
N: Luna acts like she doesn‚Äôt love this. She does.
C: NATALIA
D: Max, it looks like you‚Äôre wearing your dinner. Go change your shirt.
N: Max looks at his shirt. Sure enough, it has a giant stain.
C: LYDIA
D: Aiaiai. Anda, vamos.
N: Max follows Lydia out as Natalia fills a water bottle at the sink and ticks off a mental list.
C: NATALIA
D: Okay, Max is changing, we have our water bottle...
E: MORE CONTINUED

D: Did you get the bouquet?
E: 2 CONT'D to Joaquin, sotto
C: JOAQUIN
D: It‚Äôs in the car.
C: NATALIA
D: Perfect. We‚Äôre good to go.
C: HUGO
D: Not so fast, Luna still needs to warm up her voice.
C: LUNA
D: Da-ad.
E: feigning annoyance
C: HUGO
D: Come on, this is the best part.
N: Acquiescing, Luna clears her throat and sings:
C: LUNA
D: Bumble-be-ee, bumble-be-ee...
N: She‚Äôs joined by --
C: HUGO/JOAQUIN/SEBASTIAN
D: Bumble-be-ee, bumble-be-ee...
E: singing
N: It‚Äôs a cacophony, but a joyful one. Everyone but Luna is off key. She tries not to laugh, knows what‚Äôs coming. Hugo creeps toward her, fingers extended, and tickles her silly. Luna squeals and laughs till she cries. Lydia and Max re-enter.
C: NATALIA
D: Alright, everyone in the car.
N: Joaquin, Lydia, Sebastian, and the kids exit as Natalia‚Äôs phone rings. She answers.
C: NATALIA
D: Hello? ...What kind of emergency?
E: CONT'D
N: Hugo stops at the door to wait for Natalia. For the first time, his self-possessed wife looks discomposed.
C: NATALIA
D: I‚Äôll be right there.
E: CONT'D
N: She hangs up, rattled. Off Hugo, concerned. CUT TO: Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 7.
S: 5 EXT. STREET/INT. NATALIA‚ÄôS CAR/EXT. CORA‚ÄôS APARTMENT - DAY 5
N: (D1) FLASHING LIGHTS from a double-parked police car. Natalia frowns at it as she parks and jumps out. She hears --
C: CORA
D: That‚Äôs what they want! To kill us!
E: O.C. shouting, accented English
N: Natalia quickens her pace, dread pooling in her stomach with each step. She turns a corner and stops. Holy shit. Two COPS have guns trained on CORA (69), who brandishes... a knife? No, a letter opener. Natalia reacts instinctively.
C: NATALIA
D: Don‚Äôt shoot!
N: Without thinking, she puts her hands up and runs towards Cora. Startled, the officers swing their guns at Natalia.
C: COP #1
D: Freeze, lady!
N: But she inserts herself between the cops and Cora -- a human shield. And also a target.
C: NATALIA
D: She‚Äôs mentally ill! This isn‚Äôt even a knife, it‚Äôs a letter opener. See?
N: Natalia knocks the letter opener from Cora‚Äôs hand. It clatters on the ground. COP #2 kicks it away.
C: COP #2
D: Get on the ground! Now!
N: Natalia‚Äôs knees obediently buckle beneath her. From NATALIA‚ÄôS POV on the ground, we see the officers rush up. TIME CUT TO:
S: 6 EXT. CORA‚ÄôS APARTMENT - SHORTLY LATER (D1) 6
N: Natalia, shaken, speaks to the cops outside Cora‚Äôs door. Nearby, GUS (40), the ornery superintendent, watches.
C: COP #2
D: It‚Äôs not the first time we‚Äôve been called out here because of her.
C: CORA
D: That‚Äôs a lie!
E: O.C. from inside
N: (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 8. 6 CONTINUED: 6
C: COP #1
D: We won‚Äôt charge her for assault. Just make sure she gets some help.
C: NATALIA
D: I will.
N: Mollified, the cops leave. Natalia takes a girding breath --
S: 7 INT. CORA‚ÄôS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS (D1)
N: -- And enters. The room is... disturbing: A plate of food on a table buzzes with flies; the TV on the floor is covered in blankets; the couch where Cora sits has been stabbed in several places.
C: NATALIA
D: Why‚Äôs the TV on a time out?
C: CORA
D: It was mocking me.
N: Suddenly, Cora looks contrite. She pats the couch beside her.
C: CORA
D: Sit.
E: CONT'D
N: It‚Äôs the last thing Natalia wants. Instead...
C: NATALIA
D: I‚Äôll just clean up a bit.
N: She picks up the plate and crosses to the kitchen when there‚Äôs a knock. She leaves the plate in the sink and crosses to the open door where Gus waits, ruffled.
C: NATALIA
D: Gus, I‚Äôve got my hands full here...
E: CONT'D
C: GUS
D: So do I. Every day it‚Äôs something; shouting, telling people off. My phone‚Äôs ringing off the hook with complaints. Well, I‚Äôm done. I want her out in thirty days.
C: NATALIA
D: Hold on... I know she can be a handful, but I‚Äôve paid her rent on time every month for years now.
N: Cora storms toward Gus, gets in his face.
C: CORA
D: I have rights! You can‚Äôt do this!
N: (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 9. 7 CONTINUED: 7

N: Gus exits. Cora calls after him.

C: NATALIA
D: -- Mom! Just stop.
N: Off Natalia, feeling like a hell-mouth has opened up around her, MAIN TITLES.
S: 8 INT. PAREDES KITCHEN - NIGHT (N1) 8
N: Luna and Max are in their p.j.s, eating cookies at the counter with Hugo, who pours them each a glass of milk.
C: HUGO
D: ...So when she gets here, I want you both on your best behavior.
C: LUNA
D: We know, Dad.
C: MAX
D: How come we barely see her anyway? We used to visit her more.
C: HUGO
D: Mom visits her. She does her groceries, makes sure she has all she needs...
C: MAX
D: But we don‚Äôt visit. And she doesn‚Äôt come over here. Why?
C: LUNA
D: It‚Äôs obvious. Mom doesn‚Äôt want us spending time with grandma because she basically hates her.
C: HUGO
D: Luna!
N: As luck would have it, Natalia and Cora enter just then. Hugo forces a smile hoping Luna wasn‚Äôt overheard.
C: HUGO
D: Hey! Cora, long time no see!
E: CONT'D
N: He hugs Cora then turns to the kids. (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 10. 8 CONTINUED: 8
C: HUGO
D: Kids, say hi to your grandma.
E: CONT'D
C: LUNA MAX
D: Hola. Hi, abuela.
N: It‚Äôs a half-assed greeting, but Cora hugs them each, overjoyed. She bends to get a closer look at Max.
C: CORA
D: Look at how big you are! And this one‚Äôs a young lady. Has she started menstruating yet?
E: to Natalia, re: Luna
C: LUNA
D: Ew! Gross!
C: MAX
D: Wait, what?
E: confused
C: NATALIA
D: Okay, time to brush your teeth.
N: With a nudge from Natalia, Luna and Max gladly exit.
C: HUGO
D: Go spend a few minutes with them. I‚Äôll take care of Cora.
N: Natalia nods, grateful, and exits. Hugo turns to Cora.
C: HUGO
D: You hungry? I think we‚Äôve got some leftover spaghetti...
E: CONT'D
C: CORA
D: Sure.
N: He opens the fridge and rummages, while Cora grabs the cookie off his plate and polishes it off. Hugo emerges with a Tupperware and clocks his missing cookie, disappointed.
C: HUGO
D: Right then. Make yourself at home.
E: covers

C: LUNA
D: It‚Äôs no big deal.
C: NATALIA
D: It is to me. You know I have serious FOMO.
C: LUNA
D: Please don‚Äôt try to speak kid. Do I have to bunk with Max? I can sleep on the couch.
E: then
C: NATALIA
D: It‚Äôs better if you‚Äôre in here.
C: LUNA
D: ...Cora‚Äôs not one of those old people who needs diapers, is she?
C: NATALIA
D: Trust me, your mattress is the least of our problems.
N: Suddenly, Max runs up and smacks Luna with a pillow.
C: MAX
D: Pillow fight!
C: LUNA
D: You little brat!
N: Luna lunges after Max, but Natalia stops her.
C: NATALIA
D: Hey, hey, settle down. Abuela needs peace and quiet.
C: MAX
D: But I thought Cubans were loud?
C: NATALIA
D: Believe me, she is. But she‚Äôs sick right now, and when she‚Äôs sick she can be...well, mean. She can‚Äôt help it, but I don‚Äôt want her to be mean to you. So, no pillow fights, okay?
N: Luna and Max nod in agreement.
S: 10 INT. PAREDES HALLWAY/LUNA‚ÄôS BEDROOM - NIGHT (N1) 10
N: Cora is getting into bed when Natalia pops her head in. (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 12. 10 CONTINUED: 10

D: Do you need anything?

N: Natalia and Hugo climb into bed.
C: HUGO
D: Are you sure it‚Äôs safe for her to be here with the kids?
C: NATALIA
D: I locked Max‚Äôs door from the inside, just to be safe. I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt want to bring her here but didn‚Äôt know what else to do.
N: Hugo pulls Natalia close, spoons her.
C: HUGO
D: I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs sorry. You shouldn‚Äôt have had to go through that alone.
C: NATALIA
D: Well, I‚Äôll feel a lot better when my manic mother isn‚Äôt under the same roof as my kids. First thing tomorrow, I‚Äôm getting her admitted.
C: HUGO
D: I‚Äôll call Dad and tell him you need time off.
N: Suddenly, Natalia sits up and turns to Hugo, flustered.
C: NATALIA
D: No. My presentation‚Äôs tomorrow. I‚Äôll take Cora to the hospital in the morning then head straight to the office.
C: HUGO
D: Babe, be reasonable...
N: (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 13. 11 CONTINUED: 11
C: NATALIA
D: I‚Äôm not letting her disrupt my life. Joaquin‚Äôs wanted to grow the company from construction to real estate development for years. It means a lot that he‚Äôd consider letting me lead the expansion. So, I‚Äôm finding him the perfect investment property, and tomorrow I‚Äôm showing him and everyone else my vision for the company‚Äôs future.

N: Natalia turns the corner into Luna‚Äôs room and stops at the door when she sees Cora braiding Luna‚Äôs hair.
C: CORA
D: ...Always start at the ends to get out the tangles. See?
N: Cora ties off the braid and holds up a mirror for Luna.
C: LUNA
D: Wow. Usually Mom‚Äôs the only one who knows how to do my hair.
C: CORA
D: Who do you think taught her?
C: LUNA
D: Thanks, ‚Äòuela.

C: MAX
D: More syrup?
N: But Cora doesn‚Äôt hear him. She stares blankly into the distance, mumbling incoherently and snaps her hand back like she‚Äôs shooing a fly near her ear. Max flinches.
C: MAX
D: What‚Äôs wrong with her?
E: CONT'D
N: Hugo and Natalia exchange a look -- time to go. He gets up.
C: HUGO
D: We‚Äôre going to be late. Everyone grab your stuff.
N: The kids go get their backpacks. Hugo and Natalia clear their plates and head to the sink.
C: HUGO

C: LYDIA
D: Shouldn‚Äôt you put a pin in that ‚Äòtil she deals with her mom?

E: CONT'D
C: CORA
D: I don‚Äôt need meds, I‚Äôm healthy as a horse.

C: CORA
D: Is this why you brought me here?! I may be irritable but I‚Äôm not crazy!
E: triggered, in Spanish

C: ENZO
D: I‚Äôll call in sick and be right there. ...Did you tell Adele?
C: NATALIA
D: She‚Äôs way too triggering for Mom. Let‚Äôs deal with one catastrophe at a time.

D: It‚Äôs not gouging, it‚Äôs a nice neighborhood. But if it bothers you so much I can spend the night at your place. Like you said, it‚Äôs been months. Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs time I see it?

C: ENZO
D: We‚Äôll have to trick her into getting admitted through the E.R. But first we have to find her.
C: NATALIA
D: It‚Äôs been hours. She could be anywhere. God only knows what kind of trouble she‚Äôs getting into. And the kids are getting out soon.
E: sighs, frustrated checking her watch
C: ENZO
D: Actually, if the kids can keep her distracted, she might not even notice we‚Äôre heading to the hospital till we get there.
C: NATALIA
D: Okay, I‚Äôm not loving the idea of using my kids as bait.
C: ENZO
D: That‚Äôs not what I meant. Hold on, I think that‚Äôs her.
E: then

N: Luna smiles, flattered. Enzo opens the car door and the kids slide in back with Cora.
C: NATALIA
D: Hey, kiddos.
C: MAX LUNA
D: Hi. Hey Mom, hey Abuela.
N: As the kids buckle their seat belts, Cora takes in Luna‚Äôs outfit as if for the first time, her expression disapproving.
C: CORA
D: Why do you let her out of the house with those ripped jeans? You look like un homeless.
E: to Natalia to Luna

N: Natalia and Enzo sit on either side of Cora, who taps her foot frantically. Luna and Max sit nearby playing on cell phones when a gaunt CHEMO PATIENT is wheeled in. Max sees her and quickly gets up and climbs onto Natalia‚Äôs lap, scared.
C: MAX
D: Can we go? I hate it here. It brings back bad memories.
N: Natalia notices the Chemo Patient and connects the dots. She exchanges a worried look with Enzo, then looks down at Max.
C: NATALIA
D: You don‚Äôt have to worry about Mommy being sick. I‚Äôm fine now, okay?
N: Max nods, but his expression betrays his anxiety. Suddenly, an ADMITTING NURSE with a chart opens a door and calls out:
C: ADMITTING NURSE
D: Corazona Nieves?
N: Max hops off Natalia‚Äôs lap and they all stand up.
C: NATALIA
D: Enzo, why don‚Äôt you take the kids to the park across the street, see if the ice cream guy is there? I‚Äôll deal with Mom.

N: A terrified Cora sits on a bed in a stark room. Natalia, hovering nearby, uncrosses her arms and takes a step toward Cora, wanting to offer her some comfort. But she stops short, unsure of what to do and crosses her arms again. Just then, DR. HARRIS (40s), white, kind-faced, enters with a chart and approaches Cora.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Hi, I‚Äôm Dr. Harris. Corazona?

D: Cora. And my kids think I‚Äôm crazy.
C: NATALIA
D: We‚Äôre just worried.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Do you know why they‚Äôre worried?
E: to Cora
C: CORA
D: I stabbed a couch. That doesn‚Äôt make me crazy.
C: NATALIA
D: I never said you‚Äôre crazy. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was in high school.
E: but, to doctor
N: Dr. Harris nods and writes something on the chart.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Is she on any medication?
C: NATALIA CORA
D: She refuses to take it. I don‚Äôt need medication.
C: NATALIA
D: She was on ziprasidone but I don‚Äôt know the last time she took it.
E: CONT'D
C: DR. HARRIS
D: So, you stabbed the couch? Was it particularly ugly?
E: to Cora
C: CORA
D: I stabbed it because they said to.
C: NATALIA
D: She watches TV and thinks it‚Äôs speaking directly to her. And we‚Äôre not talking a cute Jorge Ramos fantasy, it‚Äôs dangerous. Yesterday, she had an altercation with the police and nearly got herself shot.
E: exasperated

C: DR. HARRIS
D: Well, we can‚Äôt have that. How about you and I hang out a bit, run some tests, and get to the bottom of this? You just need to sign some forms saying it‚Äôs okay to treat you. What do you say?
E: charming, to Cora
N: Off Cora, considering, we PRELAP screaming.
S: 29 EXT. PARK ‚Äì DAY (D2) 29
N: It‚Äôs Max, wailing with delight as Enzo chases him and a giggling Luna around the playground. Enzo pauses to catch his breath as Luna climbs up the jungle gym. He looks at Max.
C: ENZO
D: How is it you have half the legs and go twice as fast?
C: MAX
D: Maybe you‚Äôre just old.
C: ENZO
D: I‚Äôm still going to get you --
N: Enzo lunges for Max who streaks by him.
C: KAREN
D: Hey! Leave that boy alone.
E: O.C.
N: Enzo finds himself face to face with an angry KAREN who pulls her LITTLE BOY (8) out of the play area and away from Enzo.
C: ENZO

D: -- I said get away.
N: Karen grabs Max‚Äôs arm protectively.

C: MAX
D: Let! Go!
N: He ferociously kicks Karen in the shin.
C: KAREN
D: Ow!
C: NATALIA
D: Max! What‚Äôs going on here?
E: shocked
C: KAREN
D: Are these your kids?
C: NATALIA
D: Yes.
N: Karen hangs up her cell phone.
C: KAREN
D: Well, you shouldn‚Äôt leave them alone at the park.
C: NATALIA
D: Obviously. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre with their uncle.
N: Natalia indicates Enzo. Karen realizes her mistake, but she‚Äôs either too proud or too embarrassed to admit it. Instead --
C: KAREN
D: Let‚Äôs go, Jimmy. I‚Äôve told your Dad a thousand times this neighborhood is going to hell.
E: to her son

N: (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 28. 31 CONTINUED: 31
C: LUNA
D: Because she‚Äôs racist.
C: MAX
D: What do you mean?
C: NATALIA
D: Some people assume other people are good or bad depending on the color of their skin. Some people think because Enzo‚Äôs black he must be a bad guy.
E: sighs
C: MAX
D: That‚Äôs stupid. He‚Äôs not even black, he‚Äôs brown.
C: ENZO
D: It is stupid. White people have all the power, but they blame black and brown people for everything wrong in the world even though they‚Äôre in charge. Anyone different than them is the bad guy and they get to stay in power and be heroes. It‚Äôs crap.
E: still seething
C: NATALIA
D: It‚Äôs wrong. It‚Äôs who a person is on the inside that matters. Like they teach you at school, Max, kindness counts. Right?
N: She looks at Max through the rear-view mirror, heartbroken at having to explain racism and steal some of his innocence.
C: MAX
D: Right. ...But I‚Äôm still glad I kicked her.
N: Natalia and Enzo try not to laugh, but it‚Äôs useless.

C: HUGO
D: No, now I‚Äôve ruined it. Come on, time for homework.

D: Enzo, I know you want more -- a family, kids -- I do too. We can‚Äôt have all that right now, but maybe a first step would be moving in together.
E: frowns
C: ENZO
D: You‚Äôd do that?
E: suddenly hopeful
C: XAVIER
D: Yes. I mean, I can‚Äôt apply for a new place with my legal status, and you moving in here isn‚Äôt an option, but I could move in with you.
C: ENZO
D: That‚Äôs not an option either.
C: XAVIER
D: Why not? What is it with you and your place? I know you‚Äôre not running a harem out of there...
C: ENZO
D: ...Trust me, you won‚Äôt like it.

D: I‚Äôll like it if I‚Äôm with you. Just think about it, okay?

D: Speaking of which, I got this random call from a headhunter who wants to put me up for a senior partner position at a new firm.
C: NATALIA
D: Seriously? That‚Äôs great, hon!

D: I thought so. And it makes sense to jump someplace small where I can make more of an impact.

D: ...Of course, you could come and work with me and your dad.

D: You act like he‚Äôs a crook.

C: NATALIA
D: Hugo, he made a mistake a long time ago. Forgive him. Your mom has.
C: HUGO
D: It‚Äôs not about forgiveness, it's about respect. If I can‚Äôt respect him, I can‚Äôt work for him. Frankly, I don‚Äôt get why you do. You could make twice as much elsewhere.

C: NATALIA
D: ...It may not look special, but an influx of tech companies and an excellent school district is driving up demand in this zip code. This neighborhood has older residents who don‚Äôt spend on updates, so it gets overlooked. If we flip a couple of houses here, get some word of mouth, we can build recognition with the younger set moving into the area.

N: Natalia waves off Joaquin, embarrassed, and crosses to Hugo.
C: HUGO
D: What‚Äôs up, dopeness?!
N: She goes in for a peck, but Hugo scoops her up and kisses her in earnest. Luna and Max come running through, followed by Sebastian. Seeing their parents kissing:
C: LUNA
D: Ew! Stop it!
C: MAX
D: Ahhhh! My eyes!
N: Max unloads his Nerf gun on his parents. Luna and Sebastian follow suit.

C: LYDIA
D: Let‚Äôs dance!
E: CONT'D
N: -- Hugo grabs Natalia by the waist and smiles down at her. They move to the beat; he gives her a twirl. Then, Enzo shimmies into the room with his nerf gun, drawn by the music.
C: ENZO
D: Ai! Marc Anthony!
N: He tosses the gun and throws some elbows, his flamboyant moves drawing giggles from the kids. After a beat, the doorbell rings. Natalia extricates herself from Hugo‚Äôs grip and crosses to answer it, winded and smiling. Her face falls at the sight of her sister, Adele, in no playful mood as she asks...

D: So mom‚Äôs in the hospital and you‚Äôre having a party? Classy.
C: NATALIA
D: It isn‚Äôt a party, we just --
C: ADELE
D: -- Whatever. I don‚Äôt care if you exclude me from your little shin- digs. What I do care about is the fact that nobody told me what was happening with my own mother.
C: NATALIA
D: Maybe we don‚Äôt tell you things because you act like this. For God‚Äôs sake, grow up already!
E: getting defensive
C: ENZO
D: No, Adele‚Äôs right. We should‚Äôve called.
C: ADELE
D: Damn straight. Just ‚Äòcause you pay Mom‚Äôs bills doesn‚Äôt mean you get to make unilateral decisions about her. You write a check. That‚Äôs not the same as showing up and caring for someone.
E: then, to Natalia
C: NATALIA
D: Oh, like you‚Äôre everyone‚Äôs emotional rock?! Where were you when I was in high school, struggling with our wreck of a mother?

D: No, this is Dr. Harris. Natalia?
C: NATALIA
D: Yes, hi, doctor.
E: suddenly alert
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Hi. I have an update on Cora. After speaking with her and observing her this week, I think there‚Äôs more going on here than just the bipolar disorder. My diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder.
C: NATALIA
D: As in schizophrenia?
C: DR. HARRIS
D: She‚Äôs exhibiting symptoms of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder. It‚Äôs sort of a combo.

D: Not exactly chips and a Coke.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: No. But, it explains the voices.
C: NATALIA
D: So, it‚Äôs not just the TV she‚Äôs hearing?
C: DR. HARRIS
D: I‚Äôm afraid not. She‚Äôs currently stabilized, but on the whole you can expect her condition to deteriorate with advanced age. And any progress we‚Äôve made will be undone if she doesn‚Äôt remain medication compliant.
N: As Natalia takes this in, overwhelmed, we SMASH TO:
S: 47 INT. PAREDES DINING ROOM ‚Äì NIGHT (N5) 47
N: Natalia sits at the table and downloads Enzo and Adele. She‚Äôs sober, still processing.
C: NATALIA
D: Bottom line is, he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs safe for her to continue living alone.
C: ADELE
D: You‚Äôve got plenty of room in Casa Snootington. Can‚Äôt she move here?
C: NATALIA
D: I don‚Äôt want my kids around that.
C: ENZO
D: It‚Äôs true. She has her family to think about. We don‚Äôt.
C: ADELE
D: Well, I can‚Äôt float her. And I doubt you can.
C: ENZO
D: Not on my salary. And she wouldn‚Äôt want to live with me even if I could support us both.

C: HUGO
D: Wow, drinking alone and fisting chocolate chips? What happened?
C: NATALIA
D: Mom‚Äôs doctor called. She‚Äôs getting out soon.
C: HUGO
D: So, she‚Äôs better?
C: NATALIA
D: Yes and no. He thinks she has schizoaffective disorder.

D: That sounds serious.
E: pouring himself some wine
C: NATALIA
D: He doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs safe for her to live alone anymore.
C: HUGO
D: Shit.
C: NATALIA
D: I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know I should be feeling bad for Cora and not myself, but I feel like this is all on my shoulders. Adele says she wants to be consulted, but I‚Äôm the one who has to make things happen. She and Enzo aren‚Äôt in a position to help financially, and they can‚Äôt help that, but it seems wrong that my reward for succeeding in life is being saddled with this.
N: Hugo reads the anxiety in Natalia‚Äôs face. Concerned, he tips up her chin and makes eye contact. (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 44. 48 CONTINUED: 48
C: HUGO
D: Hey. Stop worrying. If Cora needs to stay here a while, it‚Äôs not ideal, but we‚Äôll figure it out.
N: Natalia nods, unconvinced. She takes a deep breath, tries to shake off the gloom.
C: NATALIA
D: Sorry, how was your day?
C: HUGO
D: Good actually. Madeline called. That new firm wants to make me an offer based on my portfolio alone.
N: Natalia‚Äôs face lights up -- a kid on Christmas morning.
C: NATALIA
D: That‚Äôs amazing! Oh my God!
C: HUGO
D: Don‚Äôt get too excited yet. Let‚Äôs see what they offer.
N: But she plants a kiss on him, thrilled.
C: NATALIA
D: I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll see what you‚Äôre worth. I‚Äôm so proud of you.
C: HUGO
D: Just how proud are you exactly?
E: smiling wryly
N: He presses himself up against her suggestively. They kiss again, sweetly at first, but it quickly smolders into something more. Hugo pulls back, breathless.
C: HUGO
D: Are the kids asleep?
E: CONT'D
N: Natalia nods mischievously. Hugo picks her up and plants her on the counter. They‚Äôre in a heated embrace when Enzo enters with an empty glass. He sees them and stops. Smiling, he backs out of the room, so as not to interrupt the lovers.

C: NATALIA
D: I was thinking... maybe you should move into a nursing home. A place where you can get lots of dedicated attention. They could help you with your medication --
E: CONT'D

D: -- That‚Äôs where gringos send old folks to die. If I‚Äôm going to die, I‚Äôm doing it in my own apartment.
E: shaking her head
C: NATALIA
D: Mami, Gus wasn‚Äôt kidding about kicking you out. Do you know what it took to get you that place with your rental history? I set you up perfectly and you made a mess of everything. You can‚Äôt expect me to keep bailing you out. I did my best to take care of you even during my cancer treatment, but I‚Äôm just getting back on my feet...
C: CORA
D: I get it. It took me a year to recover from chemo.
C: NATALIA
D: Wait -- you had cancer? When? Why didn‚Äôt you tell me?
C: CORA
D: Stage two. In my breast. You were in college and so happy to be out of the house -- I didn‚Äôt want to burden you with my problems. I might have told you after that if you were ever around.
C: NATALIA

C: NATALIA
D: I‚Äôm still trying to figure that out. She might have to stay here a little while, but I would never put you and Max through that long term.
C: LUNA
D: We can handle it, Mom. I know you‚Äôre trying to protect us and that you want everything to be perfect because you feel bad for getting sick. But that wasn‚Äôt your fault, just like it‚Äôs not Cora‚Äôs fault she‚Äôs sick. And when you had cancer, we didn‚Äôt abandon you.
N: Natalia feels rebuked, but proud of Luna all the same. She takes her daughter in, in awe of her compassion and maturity.

C: ENZO
D: They are pretty great.
N: Enzo offers her his beer. She takes a sip and hands it back.
C: NATALIA
D: When I was a kid, all I wanted was to get away from Mom. I blamed her for everything wrong in our lives. I never considered how hard it must‚Äôve been for her raising us on her own.
C: ENZO
D: It didn‚Äôt help that her taste in men was ‚Äúdeadbeat.‚Äù But you were a kid. You can‚Äôt beat yourself up about that.
C: NATALIA
D: And yet... I always thought Mom‚Äôs mental illness was the cause of our evictions, but maybe it‚Äôs the other way around. Maybe the stress of being unable to provide a stable home for us caused her mental illness. I told her she should go to a home.
E: then
C: ENZO
D: What‚Äôd she say?
C: NATALIA
D: What do you think? Honestly, I thought I‚Äôd be okay with it, you know? Just have someone else deal with her. Then I thought about what Adele said, and she‚Äôs right. I do so much for Mom, but it‚Äôs all transactional. I‚Äôm not emotionally invested.

C: ENZO
D: Nat, it‚Äôs understandable...
C: NATALIA
D: But it‚Äôs pointless. I‚Äôve been avoiding having a real relationship with her because it hurts too much, but not having one hurts, too. Part of me thinks I should just stop avoiding her and try understanding her instead, but the other part of me is terrified -- like I‚Äôm this helpless kid again -- and all I want is to protect myself and my family.
C: ENZO
D: If I had a beautiful family like yours, I‚Äôd want to protect it, too. And you‚Äôre more invested than you think, otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt be so mad. But you don‚Äôt have to feel guilty about that. You can be mad at her and still love her. But you‚Äôre right, loving someone isn‚Äôt always safe.
C: NATALIA
D: I just wish I could fix it! If she could at least stay in her apartment maybe I could get a nurse to come in and watch her, but --
N: Unbidden, tears of frustration fill her eyes. Enzo puts a comforting arm around her.
C: ENZO
D: Nati, it‚Äôs not on you to fix this. You‚Äôve been managing Mom‚Äôs affairs for awhile and you‚Äôre so competent it makes it easy for me and Adele to get complacent. But this is a different animal. It‚Äôs going to take all of us. Maybe I can‚Äôt pay Mom‚Äôs bills but I can pick up her groceries, or keep her company on weekends. And Adele... Hm, what can she do besides stir the pot?

D: Happy birthday, sis.
E: to Natalia

C: NATALIA
D: How ‚Äòbout you? You staying?
C: ADELE
D: Depends. What kind of cake is it?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You sure you don‚Äôt want any? It‚Äôs chocolate.
E: PRELAP
S: 61 EXT. PAREDES BACK PORCH/BACKYARD ‚Äì CONTINUOUS (N7) 61
N: Sebastian takes a bite of cake and offers some to Trixie, standing on the porch, watching the kids run around the yard.
C: TRIXIE
D: No, thanks.
N: Sebastian starts back inside when --
C: TRIXIE
D: -- Can we talk?
E: CONT'D
N: And because he‚Äôs a coward, he‚Äôs hoping she‚Äôll dump him and make his life easier.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yeah, what‚Äôs up?
C: TRIXIE
D: I‚Äôm pregnant.
N: It‚Äôs a gut punch. Sebastian is stunned. A long beat, then:
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What are you going to do?
C: TRIXIE
D: Wow, that‚Äôs exactly what a girl wants to hear. I thought for once --
N: -- But she doesn‚Äôt say what she thought. She storms off. Sebastian just stands there. Hugo enters, having overheard. Sebastian expects judgement but...
C: HUGO
D: You okay, man?
N: Hugo puts a hand on Sebastian‚Äôs shoulder. His unexpected compassion further disarms Sebastian, who feels like shit.
C: HUGO
D: What can I do?
E: CONT'D
N: (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 57. 61 CONTINUED: 61 Hugo‚Äôs words are like a slap in the face, because they‚Äôre exactly what Sebastian should have said.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Do you have any idea how annoying it is that you always say the right thing?
C: HUGO
D: Trust me, it‚Äôs not your words that matter right now.
N: Sebastian shakes his head, knows Hugo‚Äôs right.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Damn it.
N: Sebastian jumps off the porch and runs out the back gate.
S: 62 INT. TRIXIE‚ÄôS CAR - MOMENTS LATER (N7) 62
N: Trixie stifles a sob and turns on the engine when Sebastian opens the passenger door and slides in next to her, winded.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I‚Äôm an ass. What I meant to say was, what are we going to do?
N: Trixie looks at him, afraid but hopeful. He reaches for her hand and squeezes it, a quiet commitment.
S: 63 INT. PAREDES KITCHEN ‚Äì CONTINUOUS (N7) 63
N: Joaquin crosses to Hugo who‚Äôs talking to Lydia.
C: JOAQUIN
D: Congrats on the job, Son. But...why would you go work for some small start-up firm when you could come work for the family?
N: Lydia wisely grabs her glass of wine and walks off.
C: HUGO
D: You can‚Äôt afford me, Dad.
E: irritated
C: JOAQUIN
D: Why are you being so childish? I take that back, when you were a child, you would have jumped at the chance to work with your old man.
C: HUGO
D: People grow up. Things change.
N: (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 58. 63 CONTINUED: 63
C: JOAQUIN
D: What changed?
N: Hugo shakes his head, doesn‚Äôt want to get into it. Suddenly, Joaquin understands.
C: JOAQUIN
D: You‚Äôre still punishing me for cheating on your mom.
E: CONT'D
N: Hugo looks at Joaquin -- he doesn‚Äôt have to admit it.
C: JOAQUIN
D: That was years ago. Get over it.
E: CONT'D
C: HUGO
D: Fine, you want to do this? You taught me to put family first, then you didn‚Äôt. Building this company, the expansion -- you act like it‚Äôs for us but when you cheated on Mom you proved all you care about is you. Your needs, your legacy, your ego -- that‚Äôs what mattered. I was older than Sebastian, I bounced back, but it pisses me off to see him sabotage a good relationship because he has no faith in love or family. You did that.
N: Hugo starts to move off, but Joaquin stops him.
C: JOAQUIN
D: The Joneses are trying to sink our real estate business before it even starts. Don‚Äôt you want to stick it to those bastards?
C: HUGO
D: I already did. I married Natalia, Phillip didn‚Äôt. You may be in competition with the Joneses but I‚Äôm done measuring my dick against theirs.
N: Natalia walks up, overhearing.
C: NATALIA
D: What‚Äôs going on? Why are we talking about the Joneses?
N: Hugo shakes his head at Joaquin, who ignores the warning. (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 59. 63 CONTINUED: (2) 63
C: JOAQUIN
D: Because they‚Äôre the ones who bought both properties we were looking at.
C: NATALIA
D: You think that‚Äôs a coincidence?
E: surprised
C: JOAQUIN
D: I think we have a mole. We need to be careful about our next investment, because if these guys find a weakness, they‚Äôll take advantage of it any way they can.
N: Natalia furrows her brow. She opens her mouth to tell Joaquin about the offer she made, but --
C: HUGO
D: It‚Äôs still Nat‚Äôs birthday. You two can talk shop tomorrow. Come on.
N: He leads Natalia away. Off Joaquin, frustrated.
S: 64 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ENZO‚ÄôS APARTMENT ‚Äì LATER (N7) 64
N: Enzo walks down the hall and is surprised to see Xavier sitting outside his door. He gets up when he sees Enzo.
C: ENZO
D: What are you doing here?
C: XAVIER
D: I didn‚Äôt like the way we left things. Can I come in?
N: Enzo considers, apprehensive. Finally, he unlocks the door and they enter...
S: 65 INT. ENZO‚ÄôS APARTMENT ‚Äì LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (N7) 65
N: TIGHT ON Enzo and Xavier as Enzo flicks on the light. Xavier looks at the room and reacts, shocked. PULL BACK TO REVEAL towers of junk: newspapers, books, clothes and years worth of accumulated detritus are strewn everywhere. Enzo is clearly a hoarder. He looks at Xavier full of shame, apprehension, and fear. Xavier breathes, then looks at Enzo.
C: XAVIER
D: You were right. This place could use some work.
N: Xavier closes the door behind him and steps further inside, invested and ready to attack the problem. Off Enzo, relieved at finally bringing his secret to light. Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 60.
S: 66 INT. PAREDES KITCHEN/DINING ROOM ‚Äì NIGHT (N7) 66
N: Lydia and Cora are clearing the cake plates when Hugo, Luna, and Max approach Natalia with a large box.
C: MAX
D: Time to open presents!
N: Natalia hops on a stool as Adele, Joaquin, and the abuelas gather around.
C: HUGO
D: Enzo and I went to Cora‚Äôs place and picked these out. I wanted you to know you have a legacy of your own.
N: Intrigued, Natalia opens the box and pulls out a photo album. Natalia flips to the first photo.
C: NATALIA
D: Oh my God! Wait, who is she?
E: off photo, to Cora
N: Cora leans over her shoulder and sees a photo a young flapper girl next to a photo of a young man in a suit.
C: CORA
D: That‚Äôs my mother, Amelia. She was very stylish. And that‚Äôs my father, Gael, God bless his soul.
N: Natalia flips a page and Luna points to a photo of a 50‚Äôs-era woman playing a violin.
C: LUNA
D: She kind of looks like me.
C: CORA
D: That‚Äôs my cousin, Sabina. She was musical like you.
N: Natalia flips a page and sees a photo of herself as a little girl, holding a kitten as Enzo and Adele look on.
C: NATALIA
D: Oh my God, Muffin! Remember when Mom brought him home from work for us one day?
E: to Adele
C: ADELE
D: You wouldn‚Äôt let anyone else hold it.
N: (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 61. 66 CONTINUED: 66
C: NATALIA
D: I used to feed it with a baby bottle.
E: to kids
C: LUNA
D: Awww.
N: As Natalia flips through the album we see photos of: Natalia, Enzo, and Adele sitting on the hood of a car; Natalia and Hugo‚Äôs wedding; Cora smiling as she holds newborn Luna next to an exhausted Natalia at the hospital; a Paredes Christmas portrait; soccer photos of Luna and Max, the photo of Enzo asleep in Luna‚Äôs bed. Natalia laughs at this. She feels Cora‚Äôs hand on her shoulder and looks up.
C: CORA
D: I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have anything to give you.
N: Natalia pats Cora‚Äôs hand, emotional.
C: NATALIA
D: You‚Äôve given me a lot. Besides, you‚Äôre here and healthy. That‚Äôs the best gift.
E: off album
N: She turns to Hugo and smiles, full of gratitude. He smiles back. As the family continues to laugh and reminisce, embracing their happier memories and building a new one... Adele‚Äôs phone buzzes. She steps away to answer and we hear:
C: OPERATOR, PRE-RECORDED
D: Hello, you have a collect call from --
E: O.S.
C: INMATE, PRE-RECORDED
D: -- Ray.
E: O.S.
C: OPERATOR, PRE-RECORDED
D: Would you like to accept the call? Please say ‚Äúyes‚Äù or --
E: O.S.
C: ADELE
D: -- Yes.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: 67 INT. PRISON - PHONE HALL - CONTINUOUS (N7) 67
N: Adele‚Äôs ne‚Äôer-do-well husband, RAY (40s), speaks into a payphone, his back turned to some menacing-looking INMATES.
C: RAY
D: Hey Adele. Did you get the money?
N: (CONTINUED) Untitled Latinx Drama Revised Studio Draft - 11/30/20 62. 67 CONTINUED: 67 Adele looks at Natalia and steps further away.
C: ADELE
D: No, not yet.
C: RAY
D: You‚Äôve gotta make moves. Shit‚Äôs going down. It‚Äôs crazy in here.
C: ADELE
D: It‚Äôs crazy out here, too.
C: RAY
D: Can‚Äôt you just --
C: ADELE
D: -- I‚Äôm not stealing from my family.
C: RAY
D: Well, I‚Äôm your husband, so I‚Äôm family, too. You need to figure it out.
N: Click. He hung up. Adele looks at the phone in her hand then over at Natalia and the family, conflicted. Natalia looks at Adele and waves her over, wanting to show her something in the photo album. Adele forces a smile and reenters the family bubble. And we slowly PULL BACK on the family, finding joy in this moment, unsure of what‚Äôs to come. END OF SHOW
