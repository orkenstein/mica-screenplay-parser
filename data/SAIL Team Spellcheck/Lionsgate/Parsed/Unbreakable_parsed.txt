M: THE UNBREAKABLE BOY
M: Written by
M: Jon Gunn
N: Based on the book THE UNBREAKABLE BOY By Scott M. LeRette with Susy Flory First Draft, rev 10/2/20 Kingdom Story Company OVER BLACK - A VOICE. 13 years old. Super enthusiastic.
C: AUSTIN
D: Here’s a true fact. Things break.
E: V.O.
N: CLOSE ON a beer bottle, SHATTERING ON THE FLOOR.
C: AUSTIN
D: See?
E: V.O.
N: Leather shoes stumble, drunk, over the broken shards.
C: AUSTIN
D: Sometimes it’s bad when they break, sometimes it’s good. You don’t always know which it’s gonna be. Dad says that’s a metaphor. Mom * says Dad doesn’t know what a * metaphor is. *
E: V.O.
N: And now we TILT UP to reveal --
S: INT. IOWA COUNTRY CLUB - INDOOR PATIO - NIGHT
N: SCOTT, 42. The drunk guy who broke the bottle. He eyes a crowd of well-dressed country-clubbers. Staring back at him, uncomfortable. A banner reads: HAPPY NEW YEAR!
C: AUSTIN
D: In my life, lots of things have broken. Toys, dishes, shoelaces, bones. I’ll tell you about all of them, don’t worry. But I’m starting with this one, cause it’s important.
E: V.O.
N: Scott pushes through guests to the bathroom, trying REAL HARD to look sober. Guess what, he’s failing.
C: AUSTIN
D: See that guy? That’s my Dad. He’s the BEST.
E: V.O.
S: INT. COUNTRY CLUB - MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Scott stands at the bathroom mirror, squaring off with himself. His speech is slurred.
C: SCOTT
D: You are lost, my friend. Your moral compass is broken. You’re failing as a husband and a father.
N: He leans closer. There’s shame behind his eyes. It’s sad. Then he darkens.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah? Who are you to judge me?!
E: CONT'D
N: Before he can answer himself, the door opens and an ELDERLY MAN steps in. Scott straightens.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey man, what’s up. Sweet tie.
E: CONT'D
N: The old man glances at his tie. Is it sweet? He closes the stall to do his business and Scott turns back to himself.
C: SCOTT
D: Just cool it. You’re fine, you’re still in control. Now walk back out there, sober up and go home. Okay? Okay...
E: CONT'D
N: He fumbles with the keys, drops them in the sink. Dang it.
C: SCOTT
D: I’ll drive.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. IOWA COUNTRY CLUB - INDOOR PATIO - NIGHT
N: Scott rejoins the party, searching the crowd. He catches a glimpse of a COLORFUL JESTER’S HAT, floating between people.
C: AUSTIN
D: Look at me, I am rocking that hat. I’m Austin. Richard Austin LeRette. But you can call me Auz. Or Auz Man.
E: V.O.
N: We finally get a good look at AUSTIN. He’s 13, but seems younger. His face glows with innocence and enthusiasm. He wanders the party, snatching finger food off every passing tray. His little brother LOGAN, 11 right beside him.
C: AUSTIN
D: When I meet new people, I tell them everything. Ready? I love sneakers, pancakes, Batman, SpongeBob, Back to The Future, chicken nuggets and ranch dressing. Ranch dressing is the bomb! I’m really good at video games, especially Call of Duty, and I have a killer DVD collection, and also a shoelace collection and a hat collection. Wearing just the right hat makes my day.
E: V.O.
N: We notice Austin walks with a bit of a limp.
C: AUSTIN
D: I have a condition called Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Those are big words, but it basically means my bones break easy. I’ve broken my arms, my nose, my ribs, my head, my legs, my feet, pretty much everything. It kinda stinks, but you get used to it. I also have autism. Some autistic kids can’t talk, but I sure can! I have a pet lizard named Marty, and I love 80s rock music and I might have told you also ranch dressing. But hold on, I don’t want to lose my train of thought... “Thought.” Thought.... Thought.... Thought, thought, thought, thought,
E: V.O. beat
C: thought, THOUGHT.
D: THOUGHT! Okay.
E: deep breath, then
N: Scott finds his boys in the crowd, grabs them by the hand --
C: SCOTT
D: Come on, time to go home.
N: OUTSIDE, he leads them to the car. Austin mimics his dad’s drunken walk, thinks it’s hilarious. CLOSE ON AUSTIN. He fixates on his hat’s colorful pom poms, bouncing with every step. Then Scott trips, falls to the ground. He lays there in the gravel, LAUGHING kind of crazy. Austin LAUGHS, too. But Logan is worried.
C: LOGAN
D: Dad? Are you okay? Dad?!
N: A PASSING MAN helps Scott to his feet, hands him the keys. Careful, there. Scott throws him a friendly salute, and Austin smiles.
C: AUSTIN
D: Happy New Year! Please, thank you, you’re welcome, I love you!
N: AT THE CAR, Scott loads the kids in the back and climbs behind the wheel. Logan is scared, but poor little Austin has no idea the danger he’s in. Scott FIRES UP THE ENGINE and peels out onto the winding road, already swerving. As his car disappears into the night, we hear the countdown to midnight - “5, 4, 3, 2...!!”
T: AND WE CUT TO BLACK.
C: AUSTIN
D: That was the night when everything broke.
E: V.O.
N: Then:
C: AUSTIN
D: Oh wait, first I need to tell you about the green khaki pants! Without the green khaki pants I wouldn’t even be here.
E: V.O.
N: TITLE: 13 YEARS, 9 MONTHS AND 3 WEEKS EARLIER
S: INT. “STRUCTURE” CLOTHING STORE - DAY
N: A YOUNGER SCOTT (29) flips through a rack of pleated khakis. But his eyes are on the sales girl. Scott turns to his best friend JOE, 30. Big, bearded guy. Think Seth Rogen or Zack Galifianakis.
C: SCOTT
D: Do you see that girl’s eyes? Seriously, Joe, look, they’re the craziest blue I’ve ever seen.
C: JOE
D: So talk to her. Buy something.
C: SCOTT
D: Buy what?
C: JOE
D: Buy pants.
N: Great idea. Scott waves to the girl. She walks over. This is TERESA, 27. Mellow, cool, a little enigmatic. Her eyes really are crystal blue. Even the whites seem blue. It’s incredible.
C: SCOTT
D: Excuse me. Hi. I’m interested in these green pants.
C: TERESA
D: Good choice.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah. I’m Scott. I travel a lot for work, so...
N: Teresa realizes. Oh, he’s flirting. She sizes him up. He’s kind of goofy, but also kind of sweet.
C: TERESA
D: Yeah? What kind of work is that?
C: SCOTT
D: Medical rep. For now. But I have bigger plans.
C: TERESA
D: And are these plans pants related?
C: SCOTT
D: Could be. The pants could be part of it. So you should definitely sell me some.
C: TERESA
D: Anything I can do to help.
C: SCOTT
D: And hey, you work on commission, right?
C: TERESA
D: I do.
C: SCOTT
D: Then I’ll buy four pair... ...if you’ll have dinner with me.
E: he grins
C: TERESA
D: Well, they’re already two for one, so...
C: SCOTT
D: Okay. Then I’ll buy eight.
N: Teresa raises a playful eyebrow, contemplating.
C: TERESA
D: Eight pair of green pants, really? How about this?... You buy no pants, and I’ll have coffee with you.
E: scribbles her name and number on a receipt
C: SCOTT
D: Uhh... Teresa? I don’t think you get how negotiating works.
E: reading her name
C: TERESA
D: And you definitely don’t get how asking a girl out works. Here’s a tip, don’t use the word “negotiating”.
C: SCOTT
D: Oh, I didn’t mean, this wasn’t like, I wasn’t offering you money to...
E: fumbling
N: Joe shakes his head from where he’s eavesdropping. But Teresa just laughs. All good. Scott quickly folds the receipt.
C: SCOTT
D: Ok, I’m just gonna take this and walk away before I talk you out of it.
E: CONT'D
C: TERESA
D: Now who’s the bad negotiator?
N: He nods. Touche’.
C: SCOTT
D: Okay, I’ll call you. And... I actually do really want the pants, but, yeah, I’ll come back another time for those.
N: As Scott walks out, Teresa grins. He’s cute. AUSTIN’S VO:
C: AUSTIN
D: After that, Mom and Dad went on three dates in three weeks.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SUPER FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: A Maitre d’ seats Scott and Teresa at a candlelit table.
C: AUSTIN
D: DATE #1.
E: V.O.
N: Scott wears his green khakis and a tie. Teresa is under- dressed. Jeans and a sweatshirt. She whispers, self conscious.
C: TERESA
D: I said coffee, like a coffee shop.
C: SCOTT
D: Oh, don’t worry, they serve coffee here. I checked.
N: LATER, they talk over dinner, hitting it off. Scott lines up the salt and pepper shakers perfectly with the votives. Teresa notices, moves one an inch. He pretends it doesn’t bother him. Then moves it back. She nods. Control freak. Noted.
S: INT. VIDEO ARCADE - NIGHT
C: AUSTIN
D: DATE #2, video games. Mom dominated.
E: V.O.
N: Scott and Teresa sit side by side, playing a shooting game. Teresa kicks ass. Scott is frustrated.
C: SCOTT
D: I was in the military, how are you a better shot than me??
N: She turns to him and fires her last two rounds without even looking at the screen. Nails it.
C: SCOTT
D: Okay, let’s go find something I can win.
E: CONT'D
N: IN THE PHOTO BOOTH. They take a series of pics. The last one Teresa rests her head on Scott’s shoulder. It’s sweet.
S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD SIDEWALK - NIGHT
N: A late night walk through suburban Iowa.
C: AUSTIN
D: DATE #3. Mostly talking...
E: V.O.
N: Scott wears the khakis again. As he walks, he makes sure to take exactly two steps in each sidewalk square. She notices.
C: TERESA
D: So why leave the Navy?
C: SCOTT
D: Did my time. It was a great experience, I was proud to serve. But -- I like change. Adventure. I want to go everywhere. Do everything.
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 8.
C: TERESA
D: So what’s the next adventure?
C: SCOTT
D: Advertising. That’s my real dream. * I’m quitting the day job and starting school in the fall.
C: TERESA
D: Isn’t advertising just making * people feel unsatisfied with what they have?
C: SCOTT
D: What?? No, it’s helping people dream of something better. A good ad campaign is romantic, it’s emotional, it’s.... ART.
C: TERESA
D: Art. Wow. Okay then, I’m sold.
C: SCOTT
D: See? Did my job. Five years from now I’ll be in Manhattan, working * for a big agency, driving a green Volvo.
C: TERESA
D: Well, I admire your ambition. And your stylish yet responsible taste in cars.
N: Scott grins. He stops walking and turns to her.
C: SCOTT
D: And I admire your incredible blue eyes. Been admiring them all night actually. Seriously, I’ve never seen anything like them.
N: Teresa glances away, a little self conscious.
C: TERESA
D: Yeah. Funny thing about them. It’s actually a genetic defect. My collagen doesn’t work right, so the whites are really thin and the blue arteries show through.
C: SCOTT
D: Well the defect is working for you.
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 9. She meets his gaze. A moment. There’s definitely chemistry here. Scott steps closer. Are they gonna kiss?
C: SCOTT
D: Okay, your turn. Five year plan.
E: CONT'D
C: TERESA
D: Oh. I’m a one-day-at-a-time gal.
C: SCOTT
D: But.... Married? Kids? *
C: TERESA
D: We’ll see. I’m in no hurry.
N: Scott eyes her, there’s more there. But Teresa turns the attention back on him.
C: TERESA
D: Know what else I admire about you? Your pleated pants.
E: CONT'D
N: Scott LAUGHS. She likes that she makes him laugh.
C: SCOTT
D: Right?? I tried buying them from this beautiful sales girl with the most amazing defective eyes, but she was too principled to take my money.
C: TERESA
D: My kind of girl.
C: SCOTT
D: Mine, too.
N: And now they kiss. It’s good. Really good.
C: TERESA
D: Want to get out of here?
N: He does. They kiss more. But before it gets too heavy:
C: AUSTIN
D: They never had a fourth date, cause then this happened...
E: V.O.
S: INT. SCOTT’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Scott sprawls out on his lazy boy, drinking beer, watching TV. Joe’s on the couch. The phone RINGS. *
C: JOE
D: Bet it’s your girlfriend.
C: SCOTT
D: Girlfriend? Gimme a break, I don’t even know her last name.
N: Joe grabs the cordless, checks caller ID. Toldja. He tosses Scott the phone. Scott answers, playful.
C: SCOTT
D: Well, hey there. If you’re calling to ask me out again, I’m gonna need to know your last name.
E: CONT'D
C: TERESA
D: Scott? Hey, listen....
E: O.S.
N: Her voice sounds off. Scott sits up in the chair.
C: SCOTT
D: Everything alright?
C: TERESA
D: Yeah. Well, no. Can you.... Can you come to the hospital and get a blood test?
C: SCOTT
D: A what?
C: TERESA
D: A blood test.
C: SCOTT
D: Why would I.... Is this an STD thing?
E: face falls
C: TERESA
D: What?? No.
C: SCOTT
D: Right, no, of course, thank God. Wait, did you commit a crime? Did I??
C: TERESA
D: Scott. Just listen.
C: SCOTT
D: Okay. Yeah. I’m listening.
N: He props himself on his elbow. Waits.
C: SCOTT
D: You’re not saying anything.
E: CONT'D
C: TERESA
D: I’m pregnant.
E: finally
N: Scott jolts like he’s been tasered. He falls out of his chair, hits his head on the desk. Spills beer everywhere.
C: SCOTT
D: Hold on. Wait... dang it! Ow. Hold on.
C: TERESA
D: It’s okay.
C: SCOTT
D: Give me a second. I’m just, I’m thinking...
C: TERESA
D: You fell, I heard you. It’s okay.
C: SCOTT
D: You’re saying this is... mine?? This is ME you’re pregnant with? I mean, FROM.
C: TERESA
D: Scott. I don’t need anything from you.
C: SCOTT
D: Except my blood.
C: TERESA
D: Forget it.
C: SCOTT
D: No. Wait. I’m sorry. Wait.... Pregnant.
E: takes a breath
N: It really hits. He lowers the phone. To himself:
C: SCOTT
D: Crap.
E: CONT'D
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 12.
S: EXT. SCOTT’S APARTMENT - BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: Scott and Joe sit on patio chairs by a pit fire. Joe drinks Bud Light from a bottle. Scott taps his feet. Three on the left, three on the right. They both wear green khakis. *
C: JOE
D: You like her though, right?
C: SCOTT
D: I mean... Yeah. She’s attractive, obviously, and smart - not just smart, clever. She seems a little insecure, maybe, I’m not sure. But it’s actually kind of nice. She’s.... real.
C: JOE
D: Real is good. And you want kids.
C: SCOTT
D: Some day. After I’ve done a million other things. I was about to quit my job, get my degree. This is the worst possible time. And a baby, I mean... that’s FOREVER.
C: JOE
D: Yeah, they do tend to last.
N: Scott rubs his temples. Joe can’t think of what to say, so --
C: JOE
D: Beer?
E: CONT'D
N: Scott shakes his head. Joe shrugs, grabs himself a fresh one and pops the cap. It overflows - spraying all over his shirt.
C: JOE
D: Aw, dang it!
E: CONT'D
N: As Joe recoils from the spill, Austin’s VO interrupts.
C: AUSTIN
D: Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you the thing about Joe. It’s pretty important. He’s not real. He’s made up. He’s my dad’s imaginary friend.
E: V.O. beat
N: BACK TO SCENE. Now it’s Scott who recoils from the beer.
C: SCOTT
D: Aw, dang it!
N: CUT WIDE to reveal it’s true, THERE IS NO JOE. Just Scott sitting alone, talking to himself, beer all over his shirt.
C: AUSTIN
D: Dad invented him as a kid. It’s how he talks through things. Like Tyler Durden in Fight Club. I flippin’ love that movie!
E: V.O.
N: And now Scott sits alone by the fire. Talks to himself.
C: SCOTT
D: This is bad, Joe. This is really, really bad.
N: We pan over, and Joe is back. And he has a thought.
C: JOE
D: Hey. You know what else was bad? When you broke your collarbone freshman year.
N: Scott looks at him. Perking up. He nods, you’re right.
S: INT. “STRUCTURE” CLOTHING STORE - DAY
N: Teresa at work. Scott follows her as she folds and straightens clothes. He’s trying to make a point.
C: SCOTT
D: I was playing football. It hurt like hell, and I was laid out for months, and that’s the only reason I took up guitar.
C: TERESA
D: So what, you play in a band or something?
C: SCOTT
D: No, how cool would that be? But I love playing, and I’m good at it. Point is, sometimes good things come from bad things. Okay, forget the guitar. How about.... cheese. You love cheese.
C: TERESA
D: Everyone loves cheese.
C: SCOTT
D: Well, cheese is just milk that’s gone bad, right? Like raisins are just bad grapes.
C: TERESA
D: Raisins are the worst, I hate raisins.
C: SCOTT
D: Fine. Who’s that scientist that accidentally discovered ibuprofen. Figment....or Fletcher --
C: TERESA
D: Fleming.
C: SCOTT
D: Exactly.
C: TERESA
D: It was penicillin.
C: SCOTT
D: Exactly! Yes! A mistake in the lab and it leads to one of the greatest breakthroughs in medical history. Good from bad, right? Maybe that’s what this is.
E: point made
N: Teresa stops folding. Sighs.
C: TERESA
D: We don’t even know each other, Scott.
C: SCOTT
D: That’s the bad part. The good part is -- a new person. A person we made! You and me.
C: TERESA
D: I get what you’re doing, and it’s nice. But I don’t need you sticking around out of obligation.
C: SCOTT
D: Why not? I do have an obligation. And I want to be a father. A GREAT father. Like my father. I want to be the cool Dad, the Dad who gets it. Who has all the answers, who knows how to show affection. Who’s there.
E: MORE
C: SCOTT
D: And no, I didn’t think it would happen this soon, or like this. But it’s happening. That -- -- makes me a father. And my kid is NOT gonna grow up without a father. I’m gonna be there. And I’m gonna be SO cool.
E: CONT'D points to her belly
N: Teresa smiles, she can’t help it.
C: SCOTT
D: Look at your face, I’m winning you over! All I’m saying -- what I’m proposing -- is let’s give this a try. Together. Could be good. Right?
E: CONT'D
N: He’s totally sincere, and kind of adorable, and from the look on her face, this is actually what she was hoping he’d say.
S: EXT. SCOTT’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - DAY
N: Scott parks his ‘92 Buick Century before a white two story house, framed by Iowa cornfields. Joe in the passenger seat.
C: JOE
D: Oh man, your Mom is gonna destroy you!
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, well if I go, you go with me.
N: And then - CRASH!!
S: INT. SCOTT’S PARENTS' HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: SCOTT’S MOM (50s) SMASHES a dish on the kitchen floor.
C: SCOTT’S MOM
D: What’s the matter with you?? Are you STUPID?! You should be married by now, not getting some girl pregnant! This is not how I raised you!
N: Mom is short and tough. Her home is adorned with strong Catholic influences, which only reinforces the problem. Scott sits at the kitchen table, sheepish, across from his DAD, a quiet, kind, blue collar man. They avoid eye contact as Mom storms out of the room, BREAKS something else. Dad shrugs. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 16.
C: SCOTT’S DAD
D: Give her a minute. You know the Warden, she processes through destruction. But hey. I’m proud of you.
E: leans closer
C: SCOTT
D: You are?
C: SCOTT’S DAD
D: You’re stepping up. Facing consequences. That’s what a man does. What a Dad does.
N: Scott nods. Okay.
C: SCOTT
D: But I don’t know if I’m ready to be a Dad.
C: SCOTT’S DAD
D: Oh, I’m not either. Parents have no idea what’s going on. None of us.
C: SCOTT
D: Thanks. Gotta say, I did not think * this would go so well.
N: Another CRASH.
S: EXT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S APARTMENT - DAY
N: A charming little apartment complex in small town Iowa. MOVING TRUCK parked outside. Scott and Teresa (now 4 months pregnant) climb out. Stand and look at the apartment together.
C: TERESA
D: So we’re doing this?
C: SCOTT
D: I think we’re doing this.
N: LATER, Teresa sorts boxes. Scott and Joe wrestle a mattress through the front entrance.
C: SCOTT
D: Lower the left side, lower the left side. The LEFT SIDE!
E: CONT'D
N: Teresa watches him, amused, as he hefts the mattress alone, yelling at himself. What a weirdo. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 17.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: The place is half-unpacked. Some boxes against the walls. Fast food wrappers on the coffee table. Teresa sits on Scott’s lazy boy, playing PLAYSTATION 2. Scott * strums his guitar on the couch. He looks around.
C: SCOTT
D: It’s not bad, right? Small.
C: TERESA
D: Not too small. I like it.
C: SCOTT
D: We’ll get a house soon. Once my band goes platinum.
E: plays a riff
C: TERESA
D: It’s the album that goes platinum, dummy, not the band.
C: SCOTT
D: You want the house or not?
C: TERESA
D: Hey, what happened to your * advertising degree? Weren’t you * supposed to start in the fall?
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah. Something came up. I knocked up this girl and have to help raise the baby for a while. Just long enough to look like a good guy. Then, back to my dreams!
E: pokes her belly
N: She laughs, but seems sad to hear that. She pauses the game --
C: TERESA
D: So, hey.... there’s something I haven’t told you yet.
C: SCOTT
D: Scary way to start our first night together.
N: Teresa gets up, busies herself clearing the dinner wrappers.
C: TERESA
D: It’s just. One of the side effects of my “amazing” blue eyes....
E: MORE
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 18.
C: TERESA
D: I have a condition called Osteogenesis Imperfecta. “O.I.”
E: CONT'D deep breath
N: Scott follows her into the kitchen. Concerned.
C: SCOTT
D: Which means?
C: TERESA
D: It means my bones are very brittle. They break easily.
N: Scott doesn’t respond. But she can see it right away. He thinks I’m defective. Teresa tucks her thumbs under her * fingers, making a fist, then squeezes. A nervous habit. *
C: TERESA
D: I would have told you sooner, but it’s not exactly the kind of thing you share on a first date. Or a third. And then...
E: CONT'D
N: She looks to her belly. Scott can see she feels vulnerable.
C: SCOTT
D: Well, you seem fine to me.
N: She wishes he used a better word than “fine”.
C: TERESA
D: I am. I’m fine. Broke a lot of bones growing up, but I’ve learned how to live with it. There’s just certain things I can’t do. Sports, skydiving...
C: SCOTT
D: Ok. No skydiving. I can live with that.
E: shrugs
C: TERESA
D: Anyway, I thought you should know, because.... it’s genetic, so...
N: Scott moves to her.
C: SCOTT
D: T. Our baby is gonna be perfect. And if we’re lucky -- his eyes will be half as defective as yours.
N: She laughs, grateful. Scott wraps his arms around her. But as we PUSH IN, we see his gaze go far off. FROM THIS -- Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 19.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Teresa SCREAMS, mid-delivery. Scott by her side. Joe is there for moral support.
C: SCOTT
D: You’re doing great, T. You’re a champ.
C: TERESA
D: You don’t know that, you don’t even KNOW me!!
N: A NURSE frowns at Scott. He waves it off.
C: SCOTT
D: Not true, I know her, it’s just new.
N: Then T’s sister LORI (34) runs in, disheveled even in scrubs. *
C: LORI *
D: I’m here, I’m here! Stupid boss * made me settler the register and my * dang truck wouldn’t start again. *
N: She rushes to Teresa’s other side. Takes her hand. *
C: TERESA *
D: Finally! Scott, this is my sister * Lori. Lori, Scott.... AAAWWHHHHH!!! *
N: Scott and Lori shake awkwardly over Teresa’s belly. The nurse * eyes Scott again. *
C: SCOTT *
D: I said it was new! *
C: DOCTOR
D: Okay, here’s the head...
N: Scott peeks, curious, then goes pale. Turns to Joe.
C: SCOTT
D: Don’t look. There’s blood.
N: Joe looks, and instantly faints. Hits the floor with a THUD.
C: DOCTOR
D: Cord is wrapped around the neck. Get me forceps.
E: calling out
N: Everyone SCRAMBLES. The nurse hands him the cold metal instrument. Scott gapes. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 20.
C: SCOTT
D: Everything okay?
C: DOCTOR
D: It’s fine, your baby will be fine.
C: SCOTT
D: I’m feeling light headed, can I get some ice chips?
E: sweating
C: NURSE
D: Ice is for the mother.
C: SCOTT
D: All of it?
C: TERESA
D: Scott, you’re freaking me out. Look at me. Just breathe.
N: Scott locks eyes with Teresa. He nods.
C: SCOTT
D: Right. You, too. Breathe. We’ll both breathe.
N: And as she SCREAMS again, Austin’s VO comes back --
C: AUSTIN
D: Okay, pay attention. Here’s the part where I come in.
E: V.O.
N: TERESA’S SCREAM echos over to: BABY AUSTIN. Swaddled in Scott’s arms. Eyes blue as the ocean. Just like his mother’s. PUSH IN ON SCOTT. Filled with wonder. He stares into the face of his son, utterly in love. His world changed. Lori strokes Teresa’s head, whispers to her. The two of them * seem close, as if they’ve endured hard times together. * Scott’s Mom and Dad dote over the baby.
C: SCOTT
D: Mom, Dad. Meet Richard Austin LeRette.
C: SCOTT’S MOM
D: He’s a miracle. Despite your bad choices.
E: beat
N: FROM THE BED, Teresa watches Scott. Tears running down his face. She smiles. Scott carries Austin to her.
C: SCOTT
D: Check it out, T. We made a boy. Look at him, he’s perfect.
N: She gazes at her son. He is perfect. Then he starts CRYING.
C: AUSTIN
D: I cried a lot. Right away. Partly cause I was a baby. And partly cause those metal things broke my ribs. But no one even knew.
E: V.O.
N: Close on BABY AUSTIN’S SCREAMING FACE.
C: AUSTIN
D: That was break #1.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
N: ANGLE ON Scott and Teresa, utterly exhausted, staring down into Austin’s crib. He’s still SCREAMING.
C: SCOTT
D: When does he sleep? When do WE sleep?
C: TERESA
D: What have we done?
E: shell shocked
N: Scott turns to Joe for help. He’s just as exhausted.
C: JOE
D: Looks like you got this, I’m going to bed.
N: And he bails. QUICK MONTAGE - AS BABY AUSTIN GROWS - SCOTT SLEEPS. Teresa feeds Austin. He pukes, then CRIES. - TERESA SLEEPS. Scott feeds Austin. He pukes, then CRIES. - THEY BOTH SLEEP. From the crib, we hear Austin puke. Then CRY. Teresa shakes Scott. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 22.
C: TERESA
D: I’ll pay you ten thousand dollars to clean that up.
N: - IN THE DEN, Teresa plays VAMPIRE NIGHT on PS2, Austin * napping on her belly. She sings ‘You Are My Sunshine’ softly as she plays. Scott smiles.
C: SCOTT
D: You know what I admire about you? You can soothe a baby and kill vampires at the same time. *
N: - ON THE COUCH, Scott watches TV, spent. Baby bottle in one hand, beer bottle in the other. Almost feeds Austin the beer. - IN THE BEDROOM, Scott stares into his son’s eyes. Despite everything, so in love. Austin starts CRYING. Scott SIGHS.
C: SCOTT
D: Come on, little dude. What are you * trying to tell me here? What am I doing wrong?
E: CONT'D
N: But the SCREAMING gets louder. It’s unbearable. Scott covers his ears with two throw pillows. Trying not to lose his mind. AT THE FRONT DOOR - Teresa holds a crying SIX MONTH OLD AUSTIN. Scott kisses his head, suitcase in hand.
C: SCOTT
D: Daddy’s gotta work. Back in a few * days.
E: CONT'D
N: Teresa is not stoked. Scott closes the door behind him. Austin still CRYING inside. Scott take a breathe. Relief. THE SEQUENCE ENDS WITH -- AUSTIN (now 14 months) IN THE FRONT YARD. Taking his first steps. Scott and Teresa CHEER HIM ON.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Scott sits at his desk, busy on his laptop. Austin toddles around, carrying a Curious George book, making monkey noises.
C: TERESA
D: Headed to the store. You got him?
C: SCOTT
D: I got him.
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 23.
C: TERESA
D: I shut the garage door and the bathroom but he’s moving fast today. *
C: SCOTT
D: T. I got him. The gate is up. We’re good.
N: She leaves and Scott gets back to work. Behind him, Austin grabs the arm of the rolling chair, pulls himself up.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey, no climbing on the chair, little monkey. No!
E: CONT'D
N: Scott pushes back and Austin loses his grip, falling backwards hard. Scott hears an awful SNAP. He looks down to find Austin on the floor. His leg bent at a 90 degree angle. Austin WAILS. Scott’s face goes white.
S: INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - DAY
N: Scott rushes into the hospital, carrying Austin. The Curious George book duct taped around his leg as a makeshift splint.
S: INT. HOSPITAL BAY - DAY
N: Scott holds Austin’s hand as they wrap his leg in a cast. Teresa runs in, goes right to Austin. She glares at Scott.
C: TERESA
D: What did you do??
C: SCOTT
D: Nothing, he tripped. Barely. Fell against my chair, I don’t get it.
N: Which gives Teresa a sick feeling in her stomach. LATER, they sit with the DOCTOR, Austin has a cast on his leg. He plays with toys, happy as can be.
C: DOCTOR
D: His leg will heal fine. But I took a body scan and noticed two of his ribs had been broken and healed over.
C: SCOTT
D: What?? How?
C: DOCTOR
D: Most likely from childbirth.
C: TERESA
D: That’s why he cried so much! Oh my God, Scott....
E: horrified
N: Her eyes fill with tears, heart breaking to think of it. Then the doctor looks to Teresa, hesitates.
C: DOCTOR
D: Also... we ran the tests. And you’re right, he does have OI. I’m sorry.
N: Teresa’s face falls, worst fears confirmed. She turns on Scott.
C: TERESA
D: Why did you let him fall?!
C: SCOTT
D: I’m sorry, T. I’m really sorry.
N: She collapses into him. As Scott comforts her, Austin stares at the Curious George book on the floor, in his own world. We end on Teresa, looking at AUSTIN’S LITTLE CAST.
C: AUSTIN
D: That was break #2.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: The furniture is now wrapped with padding. Austin zips through the apartment, cast free, Teresa chasing after.
C: TERESA
D: Austin, no running!
N: LATER. More running. More chasing. Austin GIGGLES. This kid loves to run.
C: TERESA
D: Watch him!
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: I’ve got him.
N: Austin trips. SCREAMS.
C: SCOTT
D: Dammit!

E: V.O.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Scott and Teresa commiserate as they get ready for bed.
C: TERESA
D: ....At lunch he pulled all the napkins from the dispenser, one by one. I told him to stop, but he wouldn’t, what am I gonna do? Can’t spank him, he might break.
C: SCOTT
D: The kid’s got all the power.
C: TERESA
D: It’s impossible, Scott, I’m panicked all the time.
C: SCOTT
D: I know, me too! We’re being held hostage by a toddler!
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - SCOTT’S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Scott digs though boxes. Tax stuff. Joe pours them both wine. Scott gulps his down. Stares at some paperwork, confused.
C: SCOTT
D: This is weird.
C: JOE
D: What’s weird?
C: SCOTT
D: Teresa’s last name is Houser.
C: JOE
D: That’s not that weird.
N: Scott holds up a legal document.
C: SCOTT
D: So why does this say Teresa Morrison??
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 26. CLOSE ON PAPER. The words ‘Teresa Morrison’. Further down, the word ‘DIVORCE’. Scott and Joe look at each other. WTF?
C: TERESA
D: Yes. I was married...
E: PRELAP
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - DEN - NIGHT
N: Scott paces, a little drunk. Teresa looks ashamed. Tucking * her thumbs under her fingers again. *
C: TERESA
D: Twice.
C: SCOTT
D: Twice??
C: TERESA
D: Yes. Jim for a few months, then Rudy for a few years.
N: Scott tries to process this. *
C: TERESA
D: I was 18 the first time. Just * needed to get out of my house. * * My father was an alcoholic and my * mom, she tried, really tried, to * hold everything together. They’re * not bad people, they just... it was * a mess.... and I thought getting * married was my way out. When that * didn’t work, I tried again. *
E: CONT'D with difficulty
C: SCOTT
D: Anything else you want to share while we’re getting to know each other?
C: TERESA
D: No. That’s it.
N: Scott paces more. Teresa goes quiet. Bracing for the worst.
C: TERESA
D: Are you mad?
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, I’m mad! I guess. I don’t know. I feel a little duped, Teresa.
E: beat
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 27.
C: TERESA
D: I wasn’t trying to hide anything, I just... I was afraid you’d be done with me. I wouldn’t blame you...
N: Her eyes fill with tears, turning the whites even more blue.
C: TERESA
D: I have two failed marriages, bones made of chalk. I’m damaged goods. My father used to call me “an accident waiting to happen.”
E: CONT'D
N: Just saying those words seems to send her back. She turns away from Scott, closing off.
C: TERESA
D: I would dream I was in a fairy tale, but I never knew if I was the princess or the ugly stepsister. I always felt cursed. And now our * son is cursed...
E: CONT'D more tears
N: She wipes her face, trying to be strong. But she looks ashamed, broken. It breaks Scott’s heart. He goes to her.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey. Our son is not cursed. You are not cursed. There’s a lot we don’t know about each other. I’m not perfect either. For instance, I use humor to deflect, it’s not healthy.
E: takes her hand
C: TERESA
D: True. And you’re not even that funny.
C: SCOTT
D: Let’s just.... from now on no more secrets, okay?
C: TERESA
D: Deal.
S: EXT. BIKE PATH - MORNING
N: Scott rides a trail on his mountain bike. Joe pedals beside him. His bike is identical to Scott’s. After a beat --
C: JOE
D: Twice.
C: SCOTT
D: It’s fine.
C: JOE
D: Married two times. That’s a lot.
C: SCOTT
D: It’s fine.
N: Scott pedals off, leaving Joe behind. Okay.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Scott and Teresa lie on the bed. Austin between them. He starts fussing. Scott SHUSHES. Puts a pacifier in his mouth. WE SEE AUSTIN’S POV of Scott, wide angle. His SHUSHING is more like a BUZZING. Loud, assaulting. Austin spits out the pacifier, cries louder. So Scott SHUSHES louder. Then Teresa rests a hand on Austin’s belly. Gently sings.
C: TERESA
D: You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey...
N: Austin immediately calms, stops crying. His eyes close. WE PUSH IN ON SCOTT, as he watches Teresa. Her voice calms him, too. He smiles. A nostalgic smile, like he just imagined a whole life with this woman, and it’s a good life. Teresa gets up from the bed, gently places sleeping Austin in the crib, then gathers some clothes, a dirty diaper, and carries them from the room. Scott follows.
S: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Teresa adds the dirty diaper to the pale, then pulls out the gross full bag. Finally Scott says what’s on his mind.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey.... I think we should get married.
N: Teresa stops. She shakes her head.
C: TERESA
D: No. Not right now.
C: SCOTT
D: Why not?
C: TERESA
D: It’s too soon.
C: SCOTT
D: But. I think... I might love you.
N: Teresa practically rolls her eyes.
C: TERESA
D: You’re telling me you might love me, as you propose. Right now? Like this?
E: lifts the used diaper bag
C: SCOTT
D: Come on, T, I’m being honest. This is where we are. What do you want me to say?
C: TERESA
D: Not that.
N: She carries the diaper bag out to the hallway. He follows.
S: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Teresa jams the bag into the trash chute. It gets stuck.
C: SCOTT
D: Well... do you love ME?
C: TERESA
D: No.
C: SCOTT
D: Come on, don’t do that. We agreed, we should get married.
C: TERESA
D: Don’t want to.
N: She jams the bag harder. Scott steps in, pushing until it falls to the dumpster below.
C: SCOTT
D: You don’t want to marry me?
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 30.
C: TERESA
D: Not now I don’t.
N: She struts back into the apartment. Scott looks to Joe.
C: JOE
D: To be fair, it wasn’t the MOST romantic proposal. There’s poop on your arm.
E: pointing
N: Scott looks. Dang it.
C: JOE
D: Don’t sweat it. She’ll come around.
E: CONT'D
T: AND WE CUT TO --
N: SCOTT, in his best suit. Teresa in a wedding dress. We circle around them to reveal --
S: INT. CITY HALL - DAY
N: A LARGE TATTOOED WOMAN stands beside her SCARED HUSBAND. We’re in CITY HALL. Before a JUSTICE OF THE PEACE.
C: JUSTICE
D: Lay your hands on him again, ma’am, I’m locking you up. Understood? Restraining order granted.
E: to the husband
N: Scott and Teresa share a look, try not to laugh. He whispers.
C: SCOTT
D: Is this everything you dreamed?
N: The scared husband eyes Scott as he walks out. Good luck. The JUSTICE looks to Scott and Teresa, to their family and friends in the plastic chairs behind them, all dressed nice.
C: JUSTICE
D: How about we do this outside?
S: EXT. CITY HALL GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: A secret garden behind City Hall. Surprisingly beautiful. SCOTT’S PARENTS hold Austin. Teresa’s sister Lori beside * them, along with a few other friends. And Joe, of course. Scott faces Teresa, takes her hands in his. For the vows.
C: SCOTT
D: You know what I admire about you?
N: She smiles.
C: SCOTT
D: You make me feel calm. Even when I know you’re scared or overwhelmed, somehow you’re the one who comforts me. You think you’re weak, but you’re actually so strong. Austin is lucky to have you for his mom. And I’m lucky to have you for my wife.
E: CONT'D
N: Teresa’s eyes glisten. She takes a breath.
C: TERESA
D: Know what I admire about you? You’re not afraid to say sappy sentimental stuff like that. No, I mean it. I’ve never had that with a man. With anyone. It’s nice. Oh, and by the way. I lied before. I think I might love you, too.
E: everyone laughs
C: SCOTT
D: I knew it.
C: JUSTICE
D: Alright then. Husband and wife. Go ahead and kiss your bride.
N: Scott and Teresa kiss. Friends and family CHEER.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Teresa is asleep in bed. Scott sits in the dark, Austin resting in his arms. Scott looks to Joe, end of a long day.
C: SCOTT
D: I’m a husband. A dad and a husband.
N: Joe nods.
C: JOE
D: Yeah. Heavy. Want a beer? I’ll get you a beer.
E: beat
N: From this: TERESA’S PREGNANT BELLY. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 32.
S: EXT. SCOTT AND TERESA HOUSE - DAY
N: She stands before a large two story house with a big yard. In the driveway, a shiny red Mustang and a white Ford Taurus. Lori helps unload boxes. She eyes the house and cars. *
C: LORI *
D: T, look at all this. How much does * he make selling medical supplies? *
C: TERESA *
D: Enough. *
C: LORI *
D: I mean it, can you pull this off? *
C: TERESA *
D: Relax, Lori, I’m fine. He got * another promotion, he’s a good * salesman. It’s not exactly his * dream job, but... it gets us this. *
C: LORI *
D: Well dang, can I be a medical rep? * Never gonna get me a house like * this with Cracker Barrel money. *
N: Once again, Scott and Joe wrestle with a mattress, while * Austin runs around, excited. A cast on his right wrist.
C: AUSTIN
D: Blue cast. Break #12.
E: V.O.
N: Teresa looks to Austin.
C: TERESA
D: What do you think, Auz Man? Like the new digs?
C: AUSTIN
D: What’s “digs”?
C: TERESA
D: The house. You like it?
C: AUSTIN
D: Yes! I love digs!
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOUSE - MORNING
N: Austin chases Scott through the house (now fully furnished and moved in) as Scott throws toys and snacks in a bag. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 33.
C: SCOTT
D: Come on, your baby brother is here! Wait till you see him, he’s like a little pink tomato!
N: Excited, Austin turns a corner and runs face first into a dresser. He WAILS.
C: SCOTT
D: No, no, no! Dude, is it your nose, * please tell me it’s not broken.... Dang it.
E: CONT'D he looks. It is
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
N: Teresa holds her new baby in her arms. Glowing. Until Scott slinks in with Austin. Black eye. Tape across the nose.
C: SCOTT
D: He ran into the dresser. I tried to... I didn’t... I. I’m sorry.
N: A CONCERNED NURSE eyes Austin, whispers to another nurse. Something about “...third time this year...” The two women look to Teresa. But she waves them off, used to this.
C: TERESA
D: Don’t worry, he’s not abusive. Our son has a brittle bone disease, you’ll see it in his charts. Trust me, if anyone’s getting hit tonight it’s him.
E: nods at Scott
C: SCOTT
D: Hey!
N: LATER, Austin eyes little LOGAN, swaddled in a blanket in Teresa’s arms.
C: SCOTT
D: Auz Man, what do you think of your baby brother?
E: CONT'D
N: Austin stares at Logan for a long beat, really studying him.
C: AUSTIN
D: Four red. Five blue.
N: Scott frowns. What? Then Teresa realizes.
C: TERESA
D: Stripes. The blanket.
N: It’s true. The hospital blanket has stripes. Four red, five blue. Scott and Teresa exchange a look. Huh.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: First night home. Logan sleeps peacefully in his crib. Scott and Teresa stare down at him, amazed. They give each other a silent high five.
C: AUSTIN
D: Logan was lucky. His bones didn’t break and he didn’t cry and he didn’t have autism or anything.
E: V.O.
S: INT. LOGAN’S ROOM - MORNING
N: ONE-YEAR-OLD LOGAN climbs from his crib. Runs to Austin (now 3) and they play together. Logan seems like a normal kid.
C: AUSTIN
D: That’s when Mom and Dad started to realize I was different.
E: V.O.
S: INT. AUSTIN’S BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Austin’s walls are lined with DVD and hat collections, all color-coded. IN EXTREME CLOSE UP, we see him organize action figures in perfect rows. Counting as he goes. In the zone.
C: AUSTIN
D: Twenty-five, twenty-six... twenty- seven...
N: Then Scott pops in, interrupting.
C: SCOTT
D: Come on, Auz-Man, shoes on, I’m late for work.
N: Austin pauses, then sweeps all the toys onto the floor and starts lining them up again.
C: AUSTIN
D: One... two... three... four...
C: SCOTT
D: Austin, now! We need to go.
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 35. Austin takes a breath. Sweeps them off again.
C: AUSTIN
D: ONE! TWO! THREE!...
E: louder, upset
C: SCOTT
D: Austin!! What is wrong with you?
N: Austin pauses again. Doesn’t look up. Just STARES AT THE TOYS. Teresa step in, intervening.
C: TERESA
D: Just let him finish, Scott.
N: Scott takes a breath. Looks at the large pile of toys, looks at his watch. Sits down, frustrated. As Austin continues.
C: AUSTIN
D: Four... Five... Six...
N: IN MACRO-FOCUS, we watch as Austin lifts a little airplane, as it moves through space, landing perfectly on the shelf. An inch to the right or left would be wrong. Scott SIGHS.
C: AUSTIN
D: Sometimes I feel like my Dad is close and far away at the same time...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. LAKE - DAY
N: Scott and Austin lie on a blanket by the lake, looking up at the giant IOWA SKY. They eat Cheetos and point out clouds.
C: AUSTIN
D: I like this day, Daddy.
C: SCOTT
D: I like it too, little dude. *
N: LATER, they run together, flying a paper kite.
C: AUSTIN
D: Like even though I’m right there, he doesn’t really see me.
E: V.O.
C: AUSTIN
D: It’s a dragon, Daddy. It’s a dragon!
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah. I see it.
N: AUSTIN’S POV, the kite comes to life as a CARTOON DRAGON. He swoops down, breathing paper fire. As he flies by, HE SCOFFS -
C: CARTOON DRAGON
D: He’s lying. He doesn’t see me.
N: Auz stops running, getting upset. Scott has no idea why.
C: AUSTIN
D: You don’t really see him, you’re just saying that. Why can’t you see it?? Daddy, WHY??
N: Scott tries comforting him, but Austin is inconsolable.
C: SCOTT
D: Austin, hey, relax, I don’t know what you want me to say, I don’t see what you see, I’m sorry.
N: Austin pushes him away. The moment is ruined. Behind them, the kite falls to the ground. OVER THIS:
C: SCOTT
D: I’m worried about him.
E: O.S. CONT'D
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Scott and Teresa get ready for bed.
C: SCOTT
D: He won’t stop counting. He talks constantly....
N: Teresa eyes him tapping his feet.
C: TERESA
D: Can’t imagine where he gets it from.
C: SCOTT
D: That’s different.
C: TERESA
D: You talk to yourself every day, Scott. Or to “Joe” anyway.
N: Joe jumps in.
C: JOE
D: Hey, why the “air quotes”? Was that a dig, that felt like a dig!
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 37. Scott turns on Teresa.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, well our son certainly inherited more than enough from you.
C: TERESA
D: Yes. Thanks for that. It’s what makes him our son. Stop treating him like he’s broken.
E: stung
N: Scott feels bad. He softens.
C: SCOTT
D: I don’t mean to. This just... isn’t what I thought it would be like. I feel like I’m failing. Every day. And the harder I try, the worse I * do. I just... can’t figure him out.
C: TERESA
D: Maybe you’re not supposed to.
C: SCOTT
D: Come on, T. Something isn’t right. Tell me you’re not worried.
N: She doesn’t have an answer. From this --
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOME - DEN - NIGHT
N: A ZOMBIE’S HEAD EXPLODES. Teresa and Scott play PS2. Blasting * an undead army. Teresa dominates, as always. ON THE FLOOR, Austin and Logan watch the Jim Carrey movie The Mask on a DVD player. Austin rubs his eyebrow as he watches. ON SCREEN, Jim Carrey says: “It’s party time! P-A-R-T-Y.” Austin repeats it.
C: AUSTIN It’s PARTY time!
D: It’s PARTY time!.... It’s PARTY time!... It’s PARTY time!!
E: then...
C: SCOTT
D: Okay Auz, that’s enough.
C: AUSTIN
D: It’s PARTY TIME! Party time, party time PARTY TIME!!!
C: SCOTT
D: AUZ!
N: Austin rubs his face more. Right palm over left eyebrow. It hurts but he can’t stop. Over and over, more and more manic.
C: AUSTIN
D: Party time, party time, party time, party time, PARTY TIME!!
N: He claws at his face. Scott and Teresa run to him.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey, hey, hey. What’s going on? Can I help you, Auz? What can I do?
C: AUSTIN
D: Make it stop! Daddy, make it stop!!! I want it out of my head! PARTY, PARTY, PARTY, PARTY.....!!
E: crying hitting himself
N: Scott tries holding Austin but he slaps him away.
C: AUSTIN
D: ...PARTY, PARTY, PAAAAAAAAAARTY!!
E: CONT'D
N: They watch, helpless. Finally Austin stops, face red and bleeding. He lets out a breath, his whole body relaxes. Dad hugs him carefully. Looks to Teresa.
S: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY
N: Scott and Teresa watch through a window, worried, as a doctor administers tests on Austin. Various puzzles and patterns. Austin is laser focused. Moving pieces around, pointing at objects, etc. OFF THIS:
C: SCOTT
D: Autistic? But... How is that possible? We would have known.
N: He turns to a DOCTOR watching beside them.
C: DOCTOR
D: There are all kinds of autism. It’s a spectrum. Some are more verbal than others, some don’t show the signs as early.
C: SCOTT
D: So what do we do? Does he grow out of it, is there medication?
C: DOCTOR
D: It looks like he’s already on SSRIs for OCD... various other things. We can experiment with additional medication now that we know more, but... No, don’t expect him to “grow out of it”, Mr. LeRette. This is who Austin is. The more you learn about it and embrace it, the better.
E: checking the chart
N: ON SCOTT AND TERESA, as they take this in.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Teresa sits at the table, head in her hands. Scott paces.
C: TERESA
D: Is this punishment? For the way we had Austin?
C: SCOTT
D: If you’re talking about God, I wouldn’t know how to answer that. But I’m sure lots of people have done worse things than what we did, and most of them didn’t end up with an autistic kid. So no. I think it’s just life. It’s just how it is.
N: He gets up.
C: TERESA
D: Where are you going?
C: SCOTT
D: I need some air.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: Scott and Joe sit side by side. Drinking whiskey. Scott is good and drunk. He mumbles, dark...
C: SCOTT
D: All those times... I’d yell at him, get so frustrated... make him feel stupid.... for just being who he is.
N: He’s crushed by that thought. Joe pats him on the shoulder.
C: JOE
D: You didn’t know. Now you do. He has autism. You have an autistic kid. That’s what it is. Better accept it, cause it’s real.
N: Scott nods, lets out a long, bitter breath. Downs his whiskey.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Teresa is getting everyone out the door. Scott is hung over.
C: TERESA
D: Let’s go, let’s go, we’re gonna be late for church. Austin, eat your toast, I told you a hundred times.
C: AUSTIN
D: No, you told me four times...
C: TERESA
D: Scott?
C: SCOTT
D: What? I have golf.
C: TERESA
D: No, you’re coming. We’re a family, we need to do family things... Especially now.
C: SCOTT
D: But. I don’t even know anyone there.
C: TERESA
D: Exactly, and it’s weird no one knows my husband. Come. On.
N: Scott relents. Totally bummed.
S: EXT. CHURCH - MORNING
N: Congregants file in. Scott holds Austin’s hand, Teresa carries Logan.
C: AUSTIN
D: I gotta poop!
N: Teresa checks Logan’s pants.
C: TERESA
D: And his diaper’s full.
N: Scott SIGHS. I got it.
S: INT. CHURCH - BATHROOM - MORNING
N: Scott has Logan laid out on the bathroom floor, changing his diaper. IN A STALL, Austin FLUSHES.
C: AUSTIN
D: I did it, Dadio. All good, no worries, no more poop, Auz Man wins!
N: He bursts from the stall without pants on. Just a pull-up diaper, half hanging off. He goes for the door.
C: SCOTT
D: Auz, no! Wait here with me. And put your pants on.
N: But Austin just runs in circles, chanting --
C: AUSTIN
D: No more poop, Auz Man wins!
N: A MAN STEPS from another stall. Finds Austin half-naked running in crazy circles, Scott and Logan on the floor.
C: MAN
D: Need some help here?
C: SCOTT
D: Nah. Sorry, we’re... new. I was kinda forced here against my will.
C: MAN
D: I’ve often felt the same.
E: friendly grin
N: He walks out, shuts the door behind him. Auz reaches for the knob. Scott eyes him.
C: SCOTT
D: Don’t.
N: But Auz just grins, twists the knob and bolts out.
C: SCOTT
D: NO!!
E: CONT'D
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 42. Scott panics. What do I do?? He grabs Logan, covers his naked butt with a paper towel, runs after Austin.
S: INT. CHURCH - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Scott runs into the hall, naked Logan in hand. He spots Auz about to turn a corner to the foyer, where EVERYONE CHATTERS. Scott glares at Austin. Don’t you dare. Auz looks right back at him. Eyes bright, blue and full of life and joy. In this moment, time seems to stand still, and they connect.
C: AUSTIN
D: See that? He saw me. For just a second. That was the first time.
E: V.O.
N: Then Auz flashes a mischievous smile, and bolts. Scott chases. IN THE FOYER, Scott runs around the corner....
C: SCOTT
D: Damn it, Austin! Get back here!
N: He skids to a stop, sweating, naked baby in his hands. Austin stands before a group of parishioners, no pants, diaper on backwards. Everyone stares. Teresa’s sister Lori CRACKS UP. *
C: LORI *
D: Well hello there, peanut! *
N: Scott’s face goes red. WE HOLD ON THIS.
C: AUSTIN
D: Dad says sometimes he thinks God is laughing at him. I think he’s laughing WITH him.
E: V.O.
N: In the crowd, Teresa turns, sees her boys. She shakes her head. Steps to Austin, takes his hand. Then introduces Scott to the man she’s talking to. It’s the man from the bathroom.
C: TERESA
D: Scott, this is Preacher Rick.
C: SCOTT
D: Of course it is.
E: nods, great
N: Rick just laughs, pats him on the arm.
C: PREACHER RICK
D: Nice to meet you, Scott.... And hey, well handled.
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 43. Scott narrows his eyes at Austin. You won this time. Auz just grins back, innocent. OVER THIS: “Haaappy birthday to you...”
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
N: Austin sits before a cake with a giant SpongeBob candle in the shape of a 5. Scott, Teresa and Logan (3) SING TO HIM.
C: AUSTIN
D: One, two, three, four, five. Five years of Austin. Five year plan.
E: V.O.
N: WE PUSH IN on the ‘5’ candle.
C: AUSTIN
D: Dad never got to go to Manhattan or * be in a rock band or work for an ad * agency or drive a green Volvo. *
E: V.O.
N: CLOSE ON SCOTT, singing. He looks generally happy. But with that slight malaise of young parenthood.
C: AUSTIN
D: He said plans change. And it was fine. Fine means good. Good means happy.
E: V.O.
N: Austin blows out the candle. From this -- WE PAN ACROSS A SERIES OF CASTS AND BRACES, lined up in Austin’s room like trophies.
C: AUSTIN
D: After that, more birthdays, more years, more broken bones. Break #19 I fell off my bike, break #22 was the sled. I think 27 was the closet door, I’m not sure. After a while you kinda get used to it.
E: V.O.
N: 12-YEAR OLD AUSTIN yells to his parents in the kitchen.
C: AUSTIN
D: Dad! I broke my finger!
E: O.S.
N: Dad eats a sandwich. Looks to Teresa.
C: TERESA
D: Your turn. I’m going shopping.
C: AUSTIN
D: One time it even happened to Dad and me and Mom, all in the same week. Dad called that the trifecta.
E: V.O.
N: THE THREE OF THEM EXIT THE HOSPITAL TOGETHER IN SLO MO. Auz in a wheelchair, Dad in a sling, Mom with crutches. We push in on AUSTIN, NOW 13, same age as the opening scene.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: Hectic morning. Austin scurries around the kitchen, opening cabinets. LOGAN is 11, athletic, but small for his age.
C: AUSTIN
D: Now I’m 13. I flipping love 13. Friday the 13th, Ocean’s 13. Apollo 13, you kiddin’ me, best Tom Hanks movie ever! Also, this is when I started eighth grade. I had flapjacks for breakfast. And I almost killed Mom.
E: V.O.
N: Teresa hurries into the kitchen.
C: TERESA
D: Come on guys, you really want to be late on your first day?
N: She stops. All the kitchen cabinets are open. Dozens of cups and mugs and glasses scattered all over the counters.
C: TERESA
D: Austin, what is this??
E: CONT'D
N: Austin wears new school clothes. Bright green pants, red striped shirt. A tie. All very over-the-top. Perfect.
C: AUSTIN
D: The pancake box say two cups of mix. But it doesn’t say which cups.
C: TERESA
D: You’re killing me, Auz.
N: Austin freezes. His face goes white and he runs to his room.
S: INT. AUSTIN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Scott pops his head in. Finds Austin sitting on the bed, sobbing. Inconsolable. Clutching his pet lizard, MARTY.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey, hey. What’s up? We gotta go.
C: AUSTIN
D: I can’t go to school... Mom’s dying!
E: through wracked tears
C: SCOTT
D: She’s what?
C: AUSTIN
D: She’s DYING. And it’s my fault. I’m killing her!
N: Scott realizes, tries not to laugh. Takes Austin in his arms.
C: SCOTT
D: No. No, Auz. Mom is fine. I promise, she’s not gonna die. You believe me?
N: Austin catches his breath. Wipes his nose over and over. Nods. Scott takes the lizard, places him in his terrarium.
C: SCOTT
D: Ok. Now let’s put Marty back. Wanna choose a hat?
E: CONT'D
N: Austin perks up, looks to his wall of hats. CUT TO:
S: INT. SCOTT’S CAR - MORNING
N: Austin in the passenger seat, Jester hat flapping in the window. Dad drives, Logan in the back. Austin is pumped.
C: AUSTIN
D: You’re gonna love middle school, Logan, just wait! The hallways are SO big, the teachers are the bomb and all the food is ala cart!
S: EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING
N: School BUZZES with first day energy. Scott pulls up and Austin bounds from the car. Scott eyes his hat, concerned.
C: SCOTT
D: Maybe no hat on your first day.
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 46.
C: AUSTIN
D: Don’t be a goober, Dadio. Jester is the best one. It’s the Mountain Dew Code Red of hats.
N: Scott looks to Logan.
C: LOGAN
D: He’ll be fine. Let’s go, big brother. Show me everything.
N: As Logan takes Austin by the hand, UPBEAT MUSIC KICKS IN --
S: INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Austin rushes through the hallway in his big colorful hat, greeting and hugging everyone. Some kids give him looks and * avoid him, but most of them light up. “Auz Man!!!” “How was * your summer? Missed you, pal!” When the bell rings he’s * hugging the last remaining kid in the hallway. *
C: AUSTIN *
D: School is hard but it’s WORTH IT. * You’re gonna do great! *
S: INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY
N: AT LUNCH, Austin selects his food, a la carte. The best! He goes on and on about it to everyone around him.
C: AUSTIN
D: You can pick whatever you want. Ala carte flippin’ rocks.
N: But the kid in front of him is not charmed. This is TYLER, 14. Big for middle school. Tall and athletic. A bully. FROM ACROSS THE CAFETERIA, Logan watches, concerned. As Austin tags along Tyler and his buddies. They’re clearly laughing at him, flicking his hat. Logan steps over.
C: LOGAN
D: Everything okay, Auz?
C: AUSTIN
D: Logan! This is Tyler. He said we can be best friends, all I have to do is shut up!
N: Logan steps to Tyler.
C: LOGAN
D: Hey man, that’s my brother. He’s autistic.
C: AUSTIN
D: I’m autistic. True fact!
N: Tyler nods to his buddies.
C: TYLER
D: Told you he’s one of those. And what’s your excuse? Still waiting on puberty?
E: to Logan
N: His friends crack up. Logan wants to punch this kid, but Tyler is twice his size. So he takes Austin’s hand.
C: LOGAN
D: Come on, Auz Man.
C: AUSTIN
D: Wait!
N: Austin doubles back and bearhugs Tyler.
C: AUSTIN
D: See you in class, Tyler, glad we’re best friends! Please, thank you, you’re welcome, I love you!
E: CONT'D
N: Logan and Austin walk off, hand in hand. The poor bully doesn’t know what to do.
S: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
N: EXTREME CLOSE ON A ZIPPER. Zipping. Unzipping. Austin stares. Each tooth CLICKING. The sound, the texture. ZIP, ZIPP, ZIPPP WIDER, we see Austin at his desk. A girl in front of him fiddles with her jacket zipper. The teacher drones on, Austin hears none of it. All he sees and hears is: ZIP, ZIPP, ZIPPP.
C: TEACHER
D: Austin. Austin?
E: O.S.
N: The ZIPPING finally stops.
C: TEACHER
D: Earth to Austin. Are you with us?
E: CONT'D
N: Austin snaps out of it. Looks up. Everyone stares at him, including TYLER, who snickers. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 48.
C: TYLER
D: I think his brain’s on another planet.
C: AUSTIN
D: No. My brain is right here in my head. On Earth.
N: The class LAUGHS. Good joke. Austin laughs too, but doesn’t understand why. Then he looks right back to the ZIPPER.
S: EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - END OF DAY
N: Scott picks them up outside school. Austin seems happy, which is a relief. Scott looks to Logan, checking in.
C: SCOTT
D: How was it?
C: LOGAN
D: It was good.
C: AUSTIN
D: No, it was GREAT. I made a new best friend, Dad! His name is Tyler.
N: Logan gives Dad a reassuring nod.
C: LOGAN
D: It was fine.
C: SCOTT
D: Well, good. Fine is good.
S: INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
N: Scott and Teresa prep dinner together. An old Huey Lewis and * the News song plays on the radio. *
C: SCOTT
D: No meltdowns. No calls from teachers. So... success.
N: They high five. Teresa grooves to the music, enjoying a moment of peace. Then Austin enters like a whirlwind.
C: AUSTIN
D: When is dinner? Is that what’s for dinner? Is that meat? Is that pot roast or poop with white sprinkles? Hey, are werewolves real? What if we had one in Iowa?
E: MORE
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 49.
C: AUSTIN
D: I just know they are real. Dad, I think I have a migraine. Do you have a migraine? Why do we get migraines? It’s probably because I talk too much and my cortex can’t keep up. I am such a dork, aren’t I? Do you love me, Dad? Please tell me you love me. Werewolves must be so cool. I bet they have one at the zoo. If they don’t you have to get them one. I would love to meet a werewolf and invite him to lunch.
E: CONT'D doesn’t wait for an answer
N: He paces, rattling on. It’s exhausting. JOE HIDES IN THE CORNER, wearing giant noise reduction headphones.
C: AUSTIN
D: Is Bruce Lee Chinese? Oh, I know he is. If he were alive would he still be Chinese? Or is he Japanese? Either way.... he could come to lunch.
E: CONT'D
N: As he talks, Scott and Teresa look to each other. They’re gonna lose their minds. Teresa mumbles...
C: TERESA
D: Someone has to do something, right?
N: They quickly do Rock-Paper-Scissors. Scott loses. Damn.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey, Auz Man. Austin, Dude. Listen * to me. I have an idea. Look at me. *
N: Finally Austin stops, intrigued. Dad raises an eyebrow.
C: SCOTT
D: You wanna fly?
E: CONT'D
N: Austin’s eyes light up. FROM THIS:
S: EXT. BLUE SKY - DAY
N: Austin is FLYING. He sails through the air like a super hero, backlit by the orange afternoon sun. Jester hat fluttering. Then Scott flies beside him. No wires, no tricks, these guys are flying! And to make it even cooler, A SUPER HERO THEME PLAYS. It’s magical, and AUSTIN’S FACE BEAMS with pure joy. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 50.
C: AUSTIN
D: Flying is so easy, Dad! I’m surprised more kids don’t do it.
N: Just as we’re wondering what the heck is going on here, WE CUT TO REALITY. Which is --
S: EXT. PARK SWING SET - SUNSET
N: They’re on swings. Logan pushes Austin and Scott, one at a time. Higher and higher. Austin is LOVING IT. Then Logan pushes Scott really hard and runs under his swing. He doubles back and does it again.
C: SCOTT
D: Logan, you’re getting strong! Look * how high we’re going!
C: AUSTIN
D: Higher! Go higher!
N: BACK TO FLYING FANTASY. Scott soars through the air again. He looks over to Austin. But it’s Logan flying beside him now. Scott grins, then hesitates. Something isn’t right.
C: AUSTIN
D: Higher!
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: As Scott realizes, the fantasy crumbles. BACK TO REALITY. Austin pushes Scott now. As Scott’s swing goes high, Austin tries to run under him like Logan did. But--
C: SCOTT
D: AUZ, NO!!!
N: Austin isn’t fast enough, and Scott swings back down, SMASHING into Austin’s little body like a freight train. There’s a THUD, then a horrible CRACK. Scott lands on top of Austin with his full weight. Austin is already BAWLING, his mouth wide open but no sound coming out. Scott looks down with horror at Austin’s twisted body. Austin stares back at him, in shock.
C: AUSTIN
D: Daddy, I can’t move. Why did you do that to me? I hurt really bad. Why did you hurt me???
N: Logan stands frozen. He knows it’s bad. Scott yells to him.
C: SCOTT
D: Logan, go get my phone, fast as you can. Tell Mom Austin is hurt. Go!
N: Logan snaps out of it. Sprints off. Scott cradles Austin in his arms. The Jester hat now crushed beneath his little body.
C: AUSTIN
D: I’m sorry, Daddy. I just wanted to be strong.... Like Logan.
C: SCOTT
D: It’s alright, Auz Man. You’re so strong. You’re gonna be alright, ok?
N: But his eyes betray him. He’s terrified. IN A FEW HORRIBLE FLASHES, we see AUSTIN’S POV, DREAMLIKE: - PARAMEDICS LEAN OVER HIM, loading him onto a stretcher. - IN AN AMBULANCE, Scott covers his face, stifling sobs. - ROLLING THROUGH A HOSPITAL. Teresa and Scott run alongside. Teresa’s eyes wild with fear. She yells at Scott.
C: TERESA
D: What happened? What did you do???
N: - As the stretcher pushes through double doors to the ER, Scott collapses to the hallway floor in tears.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - CHAPEL - NIGHT
N: Teresa kneels alone in the chapel. Praying desperately.
C: TERESA Please, please God.... PLEASE....
D: let him walk. Please...
N: Scott steps in, his face all shame. He sits beside her. Doesn’t know what to do or say. Teresa feels his presence.
C: SCOTT
D: I was trying to do something fun. I didn’t... I just didn’t see him. It happens, T. It could have happened on your watch, too...
E: no answer
N: She turns on him.
C: TERESA
D: But it didn’t, and it doesn’t. Ever notice that?! It’s always you.
N: She storms out. Leaving Joe alone. Well, alone with Joe, who now sits beside him. After a long, awkward silence.
C: JOE
D: You are not a terrible father.
N: Scott nods, wanting to believe that.
C: JOE
D: You are not the worst person ever. You are not selfish. And reckless. And foolish. And irresponsible...
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: Okay, Joe. Thank you.
N: A beat.
C: JOE
D: You think he’s gonna be okay?
N: OFF THIS -
C: AUSTIN
D: I’m BATMAAAAN!!
E: O.S.
S: INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
N: Austin runs into the waiting room in a custom-made carbon fiber sleeveless upper body cast. Like a bullet-proof vest. It’s pretty cool. Teresa rushes to him, relieved.
C: DOCTOR
D: He spent the whole day cheering up the nurses, reassuring them he’s fine. He’ll need to wear the cast for a few months while the vertebrae heal. But as you can see, he doesn’t seem to mind too much.
N: Austin’s cast is already signed by all the hospital staff. And there’s a giant Batman symbol drawn on the chest.
C: DOCTOR
D: You’re a remarkable kid, Austin.
E: CONT'D
C: AUSTIN
D: Oh, I’m not Austin.
C: SCOTT
D: If you’re not Austin, then -- “What are you?”
N: Austin pulls him by the collar. Face to face.
C: AUSTIN
D: “I’m Batman!”
N: Scott and the nurses LAUGH. But Teresa is still reeling.
S: EXT. SCOTT AND TERESA HOME - EARLY MORNING
N: Scott zips up his suitcase, grabs his jacket. Teresa follows him to the front door.
C: TERESA
D: They really need you? In Topeka?
C: SCOTT
D: It’s my job, T, I have to go.
C: TERESA
D: No, you GET to go. And you get to bike and golf and fish, and I’m always stuck here. With the kids.
N: He stops, looks at her. Seriously?
C: SCOTT
D: You could do other things.
C: TERESA
D: I broke my ankle last time we took a walk, Scott.
C: SCOTT
D: I don’t know what you want me to say. I’m late for the airport.
C: TERESA
D: Just go. It’s ok, I’m sorry, I’m just... I love you. Go.
C: SCOTT
D: Ok. Love you, too.
N: But it doesn’t feel that way. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 54.
S: INT. PLANE - MORNING
N: CLOSE ON SCOTT’S FEET, tapping. His work colleague MILES plops in the seat beside him. Coffee in hand. Scott is already buzzed, working on three mini vodkas.
C: MILES
D: Morning, Scott.
C: SCOTT
D: Miles. Huh.... Your name is Miles. I just realized that.
E: slurring a little
C: MILES
D: Realized what?
C: SCOTT
D: We’re on a plane. There’s a joke there somewhere, right?
N: Miles helps him out.
C: MILES
D: Frequent flier Miles.
C: SCOTT
D: That’s it!
N: He offers Miles a vodka. Miles holds up his coffee. Scott shrugs, downs it himself. Miles eyes him, a bit concerned.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S HOME - DAY
N: Teresa walks the house, picking up laundry. Clearing messy counter tops, toys, dishes. It’s unending. IN HER ROOM, she straightens a large collection of Beanie Babies. Opens UPS packages: new clothes, makeup, Air Jordans.
C: TERESA
D: Auz, new sneakers!
N: Austin runs in, stoked. Grabs them, runs out. Mom just shrugs.
C: TERESA
D: “Thanks, Mom!” “Oh, you’re welcome.” * “Love you!” “Love you, too.” *
E: CONT'D
N: IN THE DEN, she sorts mail. Opens a drawer, adds bills to a large stack. Some OVERDUE. She closes the drawer. Sits alone for a long beat. Exhales. Depressed. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 55. Finally she gets up. Clicks on the stereo. Finds a hard rock station. Aerosmith. YES! She CRANKS IT UP. Starts dancing * alone. Like a teenager at a club. Blowing off steam. Austin runs in, wearing his new sneakers. And his hat. He joins her, excited. He’s not letting his body cast slow him down a bit. They dance together. Crazy, silly dancing. It’s cathartic. Then Logan storms in, annoyed.
C: LOGAN Mom. MOM!!!
D: I’m trying to study!
E: turns the music off
N: They freeze, busted. Logan leaves. Then Teresa starts dancing again, without the music. Austin is right there with her.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Teresa sits up in bed, on her laptop. Online shopping. She clicks BUY on a $100 Beanie Baby. SIGHS. Closes the laptop. Opens it. Adds another one to the cart. Closes it again. SIGHS again. Then clicks off the light and goes to sleep.
S: INT. TOPEKA BAR - NIGHT
N: Scott and Miles hang at a hotel bar. Miles finishes a beer.
C: SCOTT
D: Another round.
C: MILES
D: Dude, we have like six hours until the meeting. Don’t know how you do it. I’m out.
N: He pats Scott on the shoulder and heads to the elevator.
C: JOE
D: I’m in.
E: O.S.
N: Scott turns to find JOE STANDING BESIDE HIM. Scott grins.
C: SCOTT
D: Bartender!
N: AT THE ELEVATOR, Miles gives one more look back at Scott. Clearly worried. WE PUSH IN ON SCOTT. His eyes blurry, his * face slack. He takes another drink. Over this:
C: TERESA
D: Without any notice?
E: PRE-LAP
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA HOME - KITCHEN - DAY
N: Scott pours himself WINE. He’s home now. Teresa paces, upset.
C: SCOTT
D: They said the company “needs someone more available for travel” or whatever. Apparently I’ve had too many distractions lately. Austin, everything...
C: TERESA
D: Is that all they said? Nothing about missing meetings, being late?
N: She eyes his glass of wine. Scott rises, annoyed.
C: SCOTT
D: They don’t want a family man, T. They want some young kid who can commit his whole life to this stupid job. That’s not me anymore.
C: TERESA
D: So what now?
C: SCOTT
D: I get three months severance. We’ll make do. Cut back while I find something else.
N: He walks out. Taking his wine with him. Then, Austin’s VO:
C: AUSTIN
D: You’re lucky if you have a dad without a job. Know why? He’s home ALL THE TIME...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. FRONT YARD - DAY
N: Scott mows the lawn. Austin tracks with him -- TALKING.
C: AUSTIN
D: Dad, know what I was thinking? Thinking is weird. Thoughts happen in your brain but you can’t see them. When I think things sometimes I look up and think I’ll see the things I’m thinking but there’s nothing there. The things I think are invisible. Isn’t that so weird?
N: Scott just stares forward, tuning him out.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: Teresa unpacks large boxes of makeup products onto basement shelves. Austin stacks them all perfectly. One by one.
C: AUSTIN
D: Then Mom started her own business selling her favorite make-up products to other people. And she worked from home, so she was around all the time, too!
E: V.O.
N: So Austin talks her ear off, too.
C: AUSTIN
D: Mom, do you know that no one owns ducks? So we could just pick up a duck and bring it home and it would be our duck....
S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
N: HALLOWEEN. Scott and family trick or treat. Austin is dressed as the IRON GIANT, his body cast painted silver. Logan is a BASKETBALL STAR, Teresa is LARA CROFT. As they knock on doors, Scott sits on a curb in a UNICORN ONESIE. Joe beside him, as Tyler Durden from Fight Club.
C: JOE
D: Hey, man, why the long face?
C: SCOTT
D: Whadya mean? I’m fine. I think I’m fine, how would I know?
N: He pulls out a flask from his unicorn pocket. Takes a swig. Joe points to the kids, collecting candy, having a blast.
C: JOE
D: Look. Look at them. Adorable. Go engage.
C: SCOTT
D: What is it with you, always in my business?
C: JOE
D: I’m just saying, you have a tendency to retreat.
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 58.
C: SCOTT
D: Maybe I think they’ll have more fun without me.
N: He takes another swig. Joe eyes the flask.
C: JOE
D: Careful, you’re gonna get busted.
C: SCOTT
D: Please. I’m a grown ass man.
E: scoffs
N: Joe flicks his unicorn horn.
C: JOE
D: Yes. Yes, you are.
N: Austin runs over, GIDDY, his candy bag stuffed. Scott quickly stashes his flask and smiles. From this, A BULLHORN BLAST:
S: INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
N: Middle School basketball game. Scattered crowd. HALFTIME MUSIC PLAYS. Logan sits with his teammates, including TYLER. * BY THE BLEACHERS, Austin wears the mascot TIGER COSTUME. Dad holds the head for him as Austin fiddles with the velcro in the back. Nervous.
C: SCOTT
D: You sure about this? That’s a lot of people out there.
C: AUSTIN
D: Don’t be a goober, Dad. Team Mascot is the greatest honor there is.
C: SCOTT
D: Okay, just... stop with the velcro.
N: He helps put the head on, and Austin runs out. ON THE COURT - Austin dances for the crowd. Having a blast. But he can’t stop fiddling with the velcro, and it looks like he’s doing some weird butt dance. The crowd CRACKS UP. But he’s not trying to be funny. On the bleachers, Tyler and his * buddies chuckle. Logan sees, but looks away, embarrassed. * AUSTIN POV, INSIDE THE HEAD -- People laughing. Pointing. CHEERING. It’s SO LOUD. They look distorted. Scary, even. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 59.
C: AUSTIN
D: Here’s a true fact about me. Some times a happy moment feels sad and sometimes a sad moment feels happy.
E: V.O.
N: Auz suddenly stops, mid-dance. Then walks to the bench and sits, head down. Music still plays, but the court is empty.
C: AUSTIN
D: I don’t always know why, I don’t always understand. That’s just what it’s like to be Austin.
E: V.O.
N: People CHEER for him anyway, but when Austin takes the head off, we see tears in his eyes. No one else notices. But Scott does. He pushes through the crowd and sits beside Austin.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey, dude. You did great. And look. * All that... ...that means they loved it. They’re laughing because you made them happy. They’re laughing WITH you, not at you.
E: points to LAUGHING fans
N: Austin looks around more. Processing that.
C: SCOTT
D: So go on. Finish your dance.
E: CONT'D
C: AUSTIN
D: I can’t.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah you can. Watch.
N: Scott gets up, puts the head on and prances out. Doing Austin’s silly dance. People start to clap. Scott grins at Austin. Come on! And Austin finally runs out to join him. And they dance together. Scott wearing the head, Austin wearing the body. THE MUSIC ENDS and Scott beams at Austin.
C: SCOTT
D: Nailed it! Love you, Auz Man. *
E: CONT'D
N: He opens his arms for a hug, but Austin just squints back at him, curious. Then -
C: AUSTIN
D: You have something in your teeth.
N: And he bounds off. Scott shakes his head. Disappointed. Not the moment he was hoping for.
S: EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT
N: Austin and Logan wait for Scott to pull up the car. Logan pulls Austin along on his skateboard, teaching him to balance. Suddenly Austin stops, looks at Logan.
C: AUSTIN
D: Is it hard being my brother?
N: Logan pauses, surprised by the question. He thinks.
C: LOGAN
D: No. It’s an honor being your brother. And sometimes annoying. But mostly it’s an honor.
N: Tyler approaches, grinning sarcastically.
C: TYLER
D: Sure that’s a good idea, Auz Man? Don’t want to break anything. Or everything.
C: AUSTIN
D: Tyler! Hi. Wanna ride??
N: But Logan pulls Tyler aside.
C: LOGAN
D: Leave him alone. He doesn’t understand. About you.
C: TYLER
D: Oh yeah? Understand what?
C: LOGAN
D: Even though you look big, you’re actually really small.
N: Tyler steps close, gets in Logan’s face. Logan doesn’t back down. But A CAR HORN breaks the moment.
C: SCOTT
D: Everything okay over there?
E: O.S.
C: LOGAN
D: Hey, Dad. Fine.
N: Tyler SCOFFS, walks away. As Logan and Auz climb in the car, Dad eyes Logan, aware.
C: SCOTT
D: That’s Tyler?
C: LOGAN
D: That’s Tyler.
S: EXT. SCOTT AND TERESA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Scott parks in the driveway. He jams burger wrappers into a fast food bag as Logan and Austin file out --
C: SCOTT
D: Not a word to Mom, remember? Boys?
C: AUSTIN
D: Not what word?
C: LOGAN
D: He means don’t mention the burgers.
N: As they enter the house, Scott looks to the curb. Frowns.
C: SCOTT
D: Where are the bins?
E: PRE-LAP
S: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Scott quickly stuffs the wrappers in the kitchen trash. Turns to Teresa, hoping he’s not busted.
C: SCOTT
D: The trash bins. They’re not out there.
N: Teresa hesitates. She’s the one who looks busted.
C: TERESA
D: They’re uhhh.... they took them.
C: SCOTT
D: Who took them?
C: TERESA
D: The company, the trash company. They came today, they took them.
N: Off Scott’s VERY confused face, WE CUT TO: A PILE OF UNPAID BILLS drops on the table. Scott pours himself a full glass of wine, angry.
C: SCOTT
D: So you just didn’t pay them? Any of them?
C: TERESA
D: I’ve been trying to keep up, but... all the surgeries and medications and therapists, I had to start putting it on cards, then the cards raised the rates, and it just... got out of hand.
C: SCOTT
D: They took our TRASH CANS, Teresa! I’ve never even heard of that! And you’re off buying Austin twenty different pairs of shoes and Star Wars crap and DVDs and... a million “bean bag babies!”
C: TERESA
D: Beanie Babies. They’re an investment! And it’s not just me, you know, all your hobbies and gadgets and country club memberships, how did you think we were paying for everything?
C: SCOTT
D: I didn’t KNOW, Teresa!
C: TERESA
D: You didn’t WANT to know!
N: AUSTIN WATCHES THEM from the other room, curious.
C: AUSTIN
D: Sometimes Mom and Dad yell when they talk. Mom says Dad doesn’t hear a word she says, which is impossible, because she says the words so loud.
E: V.O.
N: Scott gulps down his wine, refills the glass.
C: TERESA
D: I’ve been all alone here, you know? And maybe everyone else has it all figured out -- life, money, raising kids -- but I don’t, I have no clue. It’s just too much!
C: SCOTT
D: Too much??
E: grabs the bills MORE
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 63.
C: SCOTT SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS, Teresa!
D: How the hell are we gonna pay this??
E: CONT'D
C: TERESA
D: Stop yelling! You look like my Dad when you yell!
C: SCOTT
D: We could lose our home!!
C: TERESA
D: STOP YELLING!
N: Scott suddenly throws his wine glass against the kitchen wall. It EXPLODES, spraying red wine and glass everywhere. Teresa SCREAMS. ANGLE ON AUSTIN, standing in the doorway.
C: TERESA
D: Don’t come in here, there’s glass!
E: CONT'D
N: She runs to Austin. Studies his face, worried that he’s scared. He has an odd look, like he wants to say something.
C: TERESA
D: You okay, Auz?
E: CONT'D
N: Finally --
C: AUSTIN
D: We had Burger Star for dinner.
C: TERESA
D: Oh. Oh, that’s fine, honey.
N: Austin shuffles from the room. Scott looks from the broken * glass to the bills. Lowers his voice. *
C: SCOTT *
D: We can’t pay all this. *
C: TERESA *
D: What choice do we have? *
C: SCOTT *
D: We’ll negotiate. There are firms * that do that. We need to talk to * someone. *
N: Teresa nods, starts cleaning up the mess. Scott sighs, * feeling bad. He joins her. * Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 64.
C: AUSTIN *
D: Here’s another true fact. Sometimes * if you spend too much money, you have * to spend more money for someone to * help you spend less money on the * money you already spent. *
E: V.O.
S: INT. SCOTT AND TERESA’S HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY *
N: Scott sits at his desk, a stack of paperwork in front of him. Phone to his ear. He waits, annoyed, as it RINGS and RINGS.
C: TERESA
D: Give him a little more time, maybe he’s still working on it.
C: SCOTT
D: He’s not working on anything, he took my 5 grand and stopped answering my calls. He’s not gonna save us “forty thousand dollars”, he’s not gonna save us a dime, he scammed us!
N: Scott rubs his temples, thinking. Then he hangs up the phone and grabs his keys, determined.
C: SCOTT
D: Come on.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. STRIP MALL - CONTINUOUS
N: SCOTT’S CAR pulls into a spot at a strip mall. He turns to the kids in the back.
C: SCOTT
D: Stay here. We’ll be right back.
N: Scott and Teresa jump from the car. They climb stairs, find an office marked “Fast and Friendly Mortgage/Debt Relief”. Scott tries the door. Locked. Blinds are closed, but still swinging, like they were JUST closed.
C: SCOTT
D: Lyle! Open up. I know you’re in there!
E: CONT'D
N: Teresa points.
C: TERESA
D: Scott!
N: A guy in a cheap suit sneaks down a set of back stairs.
C: TERESA
D: Go, go, go!
E: CONT'D
N: They run after him. The guy climbs into a brown Lincoln Town Car and takes off.
S: INT. SCOTT’S CAR - MOMENT’S LATER
N: Scott and Teresa jump back in. Scott guns it. AS HE RACES AFTER LYLE’S CAR, WE STAY ON AUSTIN’S FACE IN THE BACK SEAT. The wind whips his hair, his eyes take in the cars blurring by, FASTER AND FASTER. Over this shot, we hear:
C: SCOTT
D: Hey!!! Lyle!! Pull over!!!
E: O.S.
C: LOGAN
D: Dad, what are we doing?
E: O.S.
C: SCOTT
D: Where is he, where’d he go??
E: O.S.
C: TERESA
D: There, behind the truck! He’s exiting! You lost him!
E: O.S.
C: SCOTT
D: Damn it!!
N: Finally the car slows. We pan to Dad, who looks back.
C: SCOTT
D: You guys okay?
E: CONT'D
N: Logan looks rattled. But Austin is GRINNING ear to ear.
C: AUSTIN
D: That was totally wicked! Go faster, Dadio! 88 MILES PER HOUUUUUR!!
N: A beat. And Teresa starts LAUGHING. Then Scott. The whole thing is ridiculous. CLOSE ON AUSTIN, happy as can be.
C: AUSTIN
D: That was a great day. Top five family moments ever.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. SCOTT AND TERESA HOME - DAY
N: A FORECLOSURE SIGN in the lawn. A YARD SALE underway. Scott and Teresa sit in folding chairs as strangers pick through their belongings.
C: AUSTIN
D: But we never caught that man in the car. So other people got to have our house. And a bunch of our stuff.
E: V.O.
N: Scott sips a beer, bitter, as someone eyes his mountain bike.
C: SCOTT
D: No. Not for sale!
S: EXT. RENTAL HOUSE - DAY
N: A much smaller house in a much less desirable neighborhood. A FOR RENT SIGN still pokes out from unraked leaves. Teresa and the kids unload boxes from the cars. Scott carries a mattress alone. Joe tries to help.
C: SCOTT
D: I got it, I got it.
E: annoyed
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT
N: THANKSGIVING. Scott’s parents arrive, and Austin throws his arms around them, no longer in his body cast.
C: SCOTT’S MOM
D: Look at you. No cast!
C: AUSTIN
D: I’m a free man!!
N: Scott’s father glances around. The living room is tiny. With old carpeting. Boxes still stacked against wall. AT THE TABLE, they all sit together. Ready to eat. Sharing what they’re thankful for.
C: SCOTT’S DAD
D: That my grand-rascals live right around the corner now, so I can visit whenever I want.
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 67.
C: AUSTIN
D: I’m thankful for food. All of it, YUM! And no more cast. And also SpongeBob.
C: TERESA
D: Well. I’m thankful for our new home.
N: She looks to Scott, trying to have a moment. But he’s already halfway through a glass of wine. Not feeling it. He raises * his glass.
C: SCOTT
D: Agreed. On all fronts. Let’s eat.
S: EXT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT
N: In the driveway, Logan shows off skateboard tricks for Austin. Scott sits with his Dad on the front steps, drinking a beer.
C: SCOTT
D: I don’t know, maybe I’m cursed. It’s always something. Another injury, another setback, another catastrophe. It’s just, it’s a lot.
C: DAD
D: There’s a word for all that, you know?..... Life.
N: Scott scoffs. Please.
C: DAD
D: Now all you gotta do is learn to enjoy it.
E: CONT'D
N: Dad pats him on the shoulder, gets up to leave. He stops in the doorway. Nods to Austin and Logan, LAUGHING in the yard.
C: DAD
D: And you’re right, son. It IS a lot.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Teresa cleans up the kitchen by herself. Austin comes through, looking in cabinets, under the table.
C: AUSTIN
D: DAD?? DADIO! Come on, you
E: O.S.
C: snickerdoodle. I know you’re
D: hiding. Where ARE YOU??
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 68. Teresa mutters under her breath.
C: TERESA
D: Bet I know where he is.
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - SCOTT’S CLOSET - SAME MOMENT
N: In the closet, only half-unpacked. Scott sits alone, hiding. Drinking. Eyes far off.
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Teresa brushes her teeth. Scott stumbles in, drunk. Collapses on the bed. Out cold. Teresa shakes her head with disgust.
C: TERESA
D: Happy Thanksgiving.
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Scott steps into the kitchen. Still blurry. Teresa stands at * the sink. Doesn’t turn around. Tucks her thumbs into her * fists, fidgeting. *
C: SCOTT
D: Where are the kids?
C: TERESA
D: At a friend’s. No school, remember?
N: Then he notices a bunch of booze bottles on the counter. Teresa’s pouring them all out.
C: SCOTT
D: What’s this?
N: She stops, flexes her hands. Turns to face him, with resolve. *
C: TERESA
D: No more drinking.
N: Scott takes a moment with that. Looks at her, at the bottles.
C: SCOTT
D: I didn’t know it was such a big deal to you. You never said anything.
C: TERESA
D: There’s a lot I haven’t said.
C: SCOTT
D: Oh yeah? And why is that?
C: TERESA
D: I don’t know.
C: SCOTT
D: You don’t know?
N: She sets a bottle down. Okay.
C: TERESA
D: Maybe because I haven’t had the guts. Maybe because I’ve been divorced twice already and I have two kids and I’m afraid I don’t have options. That I don’t deserve options. But you know what, I’m tired of living with a man who doesn’t respect me. Doesn’t respect himself. I won’t do it any more.
N: She sweeps all the bottles into a trash bag.
C: TERESA
D: You stop this nonsense now, Scott. Or I’m done. DONE. Now take this out.
E: CONT'D
N: And she walks from the room. Scott just stands there holding a bag of his empty booze bottles in his hand.
C: JOE
D: She’s not wrong. You do drink a lot.
E: PRE-LAP
S: EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
N: Scott and Joe putt the 8th hole. Lush, rolling hills all around. It’s cold, but they don’t care.
C: SCOTT
D: I drink exactly the amount you do. And it’s usually your idea.
C: JOE
D: Yeah, well my ideas are your ideas.
N: Scott putts. Misses.
C: SCOTT
D: People drink. Hell, she drinks, I never say a word. And she shops, and she plays her damn video games. Now THAT’S an addiction.
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 70.
C: JOE
D: Who said anything about addiction?
C: SCOTT
D: What? I don’t know.
C: JOE
D: So why bring it up?
C: SCOTT
D: I didn’t. You did.
N: Scott putts again. Misses again. Dang it.
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - SCOTT AND TERESA BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: It’s late. Scott comes in quietly. Teresa is already in bed, turned toward the wall. Asleep? He watches her for a moment. Like he hasn’t seen her in a while. He gently eases into bed, not wanting to disturb her. Lays on his side, breathing with her. After a moment, she reaches her hand back. Puts it on his. He takes it, and they lay like that. Together but apart. OVER THIS - Jingle Bell Rock.
S: INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAYS - DAY
N: Christmas season has begun. Lockers are decorated. Austin * runs through the halls, wearing the tiger mascot costume. * Hugs and high fives, everyone smiles, happy to see him. *
C: AUSTIN *
D: Welcome back! How was your * Thanksgiving, mine was AH-MAZING. * Christmas is next, are you ready?? * Auz Man loves you! *
S: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Austin bounds into class. He spots Tyler and sits beside him.
C: AUSTIN
D: Tyler! What’s up, my man! Did you get my facebook messages? You didn’t write back, just wondered if you got them.
N: Tyler ignores him. But Austin doesn’t get the hint. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 71.
C: AUSTIN
D: Do you want to come to my house after school and watch Yu-Gi-Oh? Are we still friends?
E: CONT'D
C: TYLER
D: Yeah, Austin. BEST friends.
E: super sarcastic
N: As the teacher starts in with class, Tyler looks to his buddy and mouths “watch this”.
C: TYLER
D: Hey, Austin. You want answers?
E: CONT'D
N: Austin looks at him, doesn’t understand. Tyler leans close.
C: TYLER
D: “I want the truth!”
E: CONT'D
C: AUSTIN
D: “You can’t handle the truth!”
E: gets it, lighting up
N: -- and launches right into Jack Nicholson’s speech.
C: AUSTIN
D: “Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns....”
E: CONT'D
C: TEACHER
D: Alright, Austin. Let’s settle in.
N: But Austin can’t stop himself, and Tyler knows it.
C: AUSTIN
D: “Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lieutenant Weinberg?”
C: TEACHER
D: Thank you for the performance, Austin, that’s enough.
N: But Austin keeps rattling it off. Tyler and his buddy stifle LAUGHTER. But the other kids feel bad for him. *
C: AUSTIN
D: “I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago, and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury...”
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 72. The teacher shakes Austin’s shoulder, and he JOLTS, rubs his eyebrow, talking faster. He has to finish.
C: AUSTIN
D: “You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall -- YOU NEED ME ON THAT WALL....!”
E: CONT'D
C: TEACHER
D: Ok, I think you need a break. Would someone walk him down to the office? *
N: A NICE GIRL volunteers. Calmly helps Austin to the door. Shooting Tyler a look. Austin claws at his face as he goes, in full meltdown mode. It’s really sad. Even Tyler looks like he feels bad. Classmates call out to Auz as he goes. ”You’re * okay, Auz man.” “We love you, dude.” FROM THIS: *
C: TERESA
D: She called it a resource class. It’s for special needs kids!
E: PRE-LAP
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Teresa paces the house. Whispers into the phone, distraught.
C: TERESA
D: She said they think it’s time, that it’s only gonna get harder, it’s not fair to him or the other kids.
N: She peeks in on Austin, who sits on his bed, obsessively re- sorting his shoelace collection.
C: TERESA
D: Apparently they have classrooms right there on campus. She said they can enroll him right away, like they’re doing us a favor.
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: Maybe we just need to adjust his meds again. What did you say?
E: V.O.
C: TERESA
D: I didn’t know what to say! I agreed. Honestly, it didn’t sound like we really have a choice. Scott.... I think I just made the worst decision of my life.
E: upset
C: SCOTT
D: No, T, relax, you always know what’s best for him.
E: V.O.
C: TERESA
D: Where are you?
C: SCOTT
D: Just doing some Christmas shopping. I’ll be home soon. I love you.
E: V.O.
C: TERESA
D: Yeah, you too.
N: She hangs up, and we CUT TO SCOTT. He’s in:
S: INT. BAR - AFTERNOON
N: A local dive bar, glass of Scotch in hand. Alone, this time. No sign of Joe. He hangs up his cell, looking guilty.
S: EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL CAMPUS - MORNING
N: Scott, Teresa and Austin follow an UNINSPIRED TEACHER to a pre-fab trailer in the back of school property. They enter the trailer, skeptical, to find --
S: INT. SPECIAL NEEDS CLASSROOM - DAY
N: A HECTIC, CHAOTIC classroom, filled with a mix of kids, some with obvious disabilities, others with behavior and discipline problems. The vibe is very bad. Austin looks to his mom. Fidgeting.
C: AUSTIN
D: But none of my friends are here.
N: Teresa doesn’t know what to say. On the verge of tears. Scott tries to be encouraging.
C: SCOTT
D: You’ll make new friends, Auz. You always make friends. Right?
N: It breaks their heart, but they hug Austin and walk out. Austin stands alone, scared. LATER. A fight breaks out between two kids. The teacher tries to break it up, gets pushed backwards against a desk. Austin cowers in the corner, clawing at his face, whimpering.
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Dinner. Austin sits at the table, dark. Mom scoops potatoes on everyone’s plates. Austin pushes the spoon away.
C: AUSTIN
D: I don’t want them.
C: TERESA
D: What do you mean, you love mashed potatoes.
C: AUSTIN
D: Well, now I hate them. They’re retarded.
C: TERESA
D: Hey, don’t say that word.
C: AUSTIN
D: Retarded. Retarded, retarded, retarded, retarded.
C: SCOTT
D: Austin, stop it.
C: AUSTIN
D: You stop it, asshole!
N: Logan spits his milk. Scott and Teresa are shocked.
C: SCOTT
D: What is with you?! You want to go to bed early?
C: AUSTIN
D: No. I don’t want to go to bed, I don’t want to go to school, I don’t want to go ANYWHERE!!
C: TERESA
D: Hey hey hey. Calm down. Come here.
C: AUSTIN
D: No. Don’t touch me, don’t come near me!
N: Teresa steps toward him and Austin WHIPS HIS GLASS AT HER, hitting her square in the forehead with an awful THUNK. Teresa stumbles back, stunned. Blood already flowing. Scott jumps up, shocked, and runs to Austin, who pushes his chair back, kicking and punching, going berserk. Logan tries to help, but Austin grips his brother by the throat and starts choking him. Logan struggles, fighting to free himself, his face turning beet red.
C: SCOTT
D: Austin!! Stop it. Let him go. AUSTIN!!
N: Scott tries to pry his hands off, but Austin flails and SCREECHES, his eyes going black like he’s possessed. Teresa rushes over. It takes both of them, but Austin finally releases his grip and Logan GASPS for air. Austin goes limp, panting and crying. He whimpers to himself.
C: AUSTIN
D: Please don’t make me go back to that room. They scare me, please don’t make me go back...
N: Teresa wipes the blood from her head. They all look to each other, reeling. What just happened?? From this, the BUZZING OF AN ELEVATOR --
S: INT. HOSPITAL - PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT
N: Revealing the sterile lobby of a psychiatric ward. Armed guards stand before a large vault-like door. Scott and Teresa escort Austin in. Still in shock.
C: AUSTIN
D: The doctor said I was taking the wrong medication and I was “under a lot of stress”, which means it was actually the medication that choked Logan, not me. Stupid medication.
E: V.O.
N: Scott fills out paperwork as Teresa tries to soothe Austin. He’s still agitated, so two nurses hold him down and give him a shot. Finally his body goes slack and his eyes stare off. A KIND-FACED DOCTOR emerges and speaks to Scott and Teresa. They listen, through a fog. Then a HORRIBLE GRINDING NOISE as the vault door slides open. Two orderlies take Austin by either arm and lead him away. Teresa and Scott try to follow, but the guard stops them. They watch, helpless, as Austin looks back, confused. Why aren’t you coming with me?
C: TERESA
D: It’s just a few days, Baby! The doctors need to make sure you’re ok, but we’ll be back in just a few days!
N: Austin’s face crumples up into abject terror, and he BURSTS INTO TEARS. Then the door slowly swings shut, sealing them off from their boy. Teresa collapses to the floor. She SOBS, her back pressed against the vault door, as close to Austin as she can get.
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - NIGHT
N: In a daze, Teresa, Scott and Logan decorate the house for Christmas. They hang ornaments on a little tree.
C: LOGAN
D: He’ll love it. When he gets back, he’ll be so happy.
N: CLOSE ON TERESA. Her eyes empty.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT
N: Austin lies in a cot. Curled up, scared.
C: AUSTIN
D: Sometimes we feel alone, even when we’re not.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. GROCERY STORE - SAME MOMENT
N: Teresa climbs into her Mustang with a small bag of groceries. She sits, trying to breathe, trying to hold it together. Then she starts the car and pulls away.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT
N: Lying in the dark, Austin starts singing to himself, soft and quiet. Like Mom would do.
C: AUSTIN
D: You are my sunshine, my only sunshine....
S: EXT. DARK ROADS - NIGHT
N: Teresa speeds along dark, winding roads, eyes blurred with tears. OVER THIS, Austin’s voice continues:
C: AUSTIN
D: You make me happy when skies are grey...
E: O.S.
N: Teresa drives faster and faster. She POUNDS the steering wheel, unleashing bottled up rage. Then, in total desperation, SHE CLOSES HER EYES AND LETS GO OF THE WHEEL. Time slows down. All sound fades away, except Austin singing.
C: AUSTIN
D: ...You’ll never know dear, how much I love you. Please don’t take my sunshine away...
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: OUT THE WINDOW - The night blurs by. CLOSE ON TERESA’S FACE. Wet with tears. Eyes clenched shut. FROM THIS, WE SEE FLASHES. MEMORIES: BABY AUSTIN in Teresa’s arms. Teresa doing dishes, 2 YEAR-OLD AUSTIN plays on the floor. AUSTIN AT 5, Teresa sings to him at bedtime. Her voice blending with his in a haunting duet.
C: AUSTIN AND TERESA
D: The other night, dear. As I lay sleeping, I dreampt I held you in my arms....
E: O.S.
N: MORE FLASHES. Playing, crying, laughing. Scott with his guitar, adding to the song. Connecting them all. BACK TO TERESA’S FACE. Eyes still closed. THEN TO THE ROAD. The car races for a drop off. AUSTIN AND TERESA (O.S.) (CONT'D) And now that you’re here, my dreams are waking... A FINAL FLASH. 5-year old Austin. Giggling. AUSTIN AND TERESA (O.S.) (CONT'D) ...and I will keep you from all harm. The tires hit the grooved edge of the pavement - BBBBBRRRRZZZZT! - and snaps Teresa back to reality. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 78. THE MUSIC CUTS OUT, replaced by SQUEELING, as Teresa slams on the brakes and cranks the wheel. The Mustang spins 360°, leaving a trail of black rubber. It finally skids to a stop, inches from the edge. INSIDE THE CAR, Teresa sits in silent shock. What did I just do? Then she puts her head in her hands and cries. Over this:
C: PREACHER RICK
D: I know this must be really difficult right now, I can only imagine...
E: PRE-LAP
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - DAY
N: TERESA’S CHURCH FRIENDS, LORI and PREACHER RICK gather around * Teresa in the living room. Lori squeezes Teresa’s hand. *
C: PREACHER RICK
D: ...but we’re here for you, and with you.
N: Teresa nods, grateful. But still overwhelmed. She bows her head....
C: TERESA
D: I know you’re with him, God, I know he’s not alone. Thank you....
N: Scott and Joe watch from the doorway, super skeptical.
C: JOE
D: Did she seriously just say Thank You to God right now?
N: AFTERWARD, Rick spots Scott on his way out.
C: PREACHER RICK
D: Scott. Nice to see you. Hope you’re holding up okay. And hey, if you need anything. I’m always around.
E: a beat
C: SCOTT
D: Cool, yeah. Actually, one thing you could do for me. Tell God if he really feels the need to punish someone right now, how about punish me? I can handle it. Hell, I deserve it.
E: MORE
C: SCOTT
D: But leave my wife and kid alone.
E: CONT'D dark
N: Rick nods, unfazed.
C: PREACHER RICK
D: I’ll tell Him.
N: With that, Scott struts away. Joe chases after him.
C: JOE
D: Oh snap! That was dope. You just told that preacher what’s WHAT!
S: INT. HOSPITAL - PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT
N: The vault door BUZZES open and the DOCTOR leads Scott and Teresa into a community room.
C: KIND-FACED DOCTOR
D: He’s been great. We’d kind of like to hire him, to be honest. I think everyone here will be sad to see him go...
N: THEY SEE -- Austin at a table, putting on a puppet show for a collection of patients. All of them smiling. Austin sees his parents and runs to them. Huge hugs.
C: AUSTIN
D: Mom! Dad!
N: His eyes are clear, he looks bright and happy.
C: AUSTIN
D: There are some really, really messed up people in here. Want to meet them??
E: CONT'D whispers, excited
N: And before they can answer, Austin starts introducing them to his new friends. Mom and Dad just smile, baffled as always.
S: INT. BURGER STAR - DAY
N: Scott, Teresa and Austin wait in line to order. Special treat on the way home. Austin taps the man in front of him.
C: AUSTIN
D: Hi, my name is Austin, Richard Austin LeRette. What are you going to have?
E: MORE
C: AUSTIN
D: I’m having the number eleven. That’s the ten-piece nugget meal with fries and a drink. I plan on getting a strawberry milkshake for my drink, because there’s just something about a milkshake with nuggets that’s absolute perfection. For the fries I will get salt and pepper and ketchup. For the nuggets I will have ranch, honey mustard, buffalo, sweet and sour, barbecue, and more ranch, of course. Oh, I’ll get a lot of napkins, too. Please, thank you, and you’re welcome.
E: CONT'D
N: The man takes all that in. Scott just shrugs. That’s my son. AT THE TABLE, Scott and Teresa watch as Auz digs in, MOANING with delight at everything he eats. Fully in the moment. Then, without warning, he looks up at them. Matter of fact.
C: AUSTIN
D: I’m not going back there again. Can I have more ranch dressing, please?
E: CONT'D
N: And that’s that.
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - CHRISTMAS MORNING
N: They all open presents. Happy to be back together. Austin holds his lizard MARTY, who wears a tiny Santa hat. The tree is small, and the gifts are, too. Logan opens one. It’s a NEW SKATEBOARD. He lights up.
C: SCOTT
D: This one is lighter and more narrow, better for doing tricks...
C: LOGAN
D: Awesome! Thanks, guys.
N: Austin rips open a present. A neon green bowtie.
C: TERESA
D: It’s a bit of a small Christmas this year, but we thought you might want to add one to the collection.
C: AUSTIN
D: You kidding, it’s the greatest gift I ever got!
N: And he means it. THAT NIGHT, Scott settles onto the couch beside Teresa. A moment alone. He hands her an eggnog. CLINKS her glass.
C: SCOTT
D: Don’t worry, no alcohol. So it’s not like it tastes good or anything.
N: A long beat.
C: TERESA
D: There’s no way we’re sending him back to that classroom.
C: SCOTT
D: I know.
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNIING
N: A FLYER slams down on the table. CHURCH CAMPING TRIP.
C: AUSTIN
D: Dad, look!! Father/Son camping trip in March. It’s annual, that means every year. We HAVE to go!!
N: Scott eyes the FLYER, skeptical.
C: SCOTT
D: I don’t know, Auz. Don’t think it’s a good idea. You’d have to sleep in a tent, there are bugs, lots of kids doing things you might not be able to do.
C: AUSTIN
D: But I CAN do it, Dad. PLEASE. I just want to do something normal. With normal kids. I don’t want to be “special”, I want to be like every other dude. I want to go camping with my Daddy.
E: emotional
N: Scott hesitates. Austin can tell he’s got him on the hook.
C: AUSTIN
D: Here’s a trick I know. If you really, really want something, just talk and talk and talk about it and whatever you do don’t stop talking and then you get it.
E: V.O.
N: Austin leans in harder now. Super earnest. Closing the deal.
C: AUSTIN
D: It could be like an extra Christmas present, since this was a smaller Christmas because of money, and I’ve been so good, and I did have to spend four days in a mental institution, and I just really, really want to go camping with you. Please, please, PLEASE, Dadio!
N: Scott SIGHS. Looks to Teresa. She shrugs.
C: AUSTIN
D: YESSS!!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - SCOTT AND TERESA BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
N: 5am. Scott and Teresa wake up to Austin jumping on the bed.
C: AUSTIN
D: Dad! Guess how many days until the camping trip? 19 and a half.
N: Scott exhales, bleary. Are you kidding me right now?
C: SCOTT
D: No, Auz. The trip is in March. That’s like three months away.
C: AUSTIN
D: Uh uh, because tonight is New Year’s Eve, and there’s a party, so we won’t even be thinking about camping, so tonight doesn’t count. And there’s eight weekends until the trip, and weekends don’t count because weekends are fun. And I’ll be sleeping nine hours of every day, so I won’t even feel those. And I have three friends’ birthday parties and then Batman vs. Superman comes out March 25, and it’s two hours and 32 minutes long, but with popcorn and trailers, that’s a solid three hours we won’t be thinking about ANYTHING else, and so none of that counts. Which leaves 19 and a half days until Father/Son Camping Weekend!!
N: And he runs out of the room. Scott looks to Teresa.
C: SCOTT
D: I really hate camping.
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Scott and the kids are dressed up and ready for New Years. Austin grabs his Jester hat. Mom lies on the couch in sweats, not happy. She whispers to Scott.
C: TERESA
D: You can’t just stay home?
C: SCOTT
D: The kids want to see the fireworks, T, they want to have a fun night.
C: TERESA
D: YOU want to have a fun night.
C: SCOTT
D: We all do. You’ll just be resting anyway.
N: She shakes her head. Whatever. Then she smiles for the kids.
C: LOGAN
D: You sure, Mom?
C: TERESA
D: I took some Tylenol, I’ll be okay. Have fun, just be home by 11 so we can watch the ball drop together.
N: Austin gives her a quick kiss, bounds out the door.
C: AUSTIN
D: Love you, Mama bear! Feel better.
N: Scott avoids her gaze. Shuts the door, annoyed.
S: EXT. IOWA COUNTRY CLUB PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: Scott pulls his white Taurus into the Country Club valet. They walk under a fancy archway to find a patio party in full swing. A banner reads: HAPPY NEW YEAR! Austin goes right for the food trays. Scott goes right for the bar. WE’VE NOW REACHED THE OPENING SCENE.
C: AUSTIN
D: Here it is. This is the night I was telling you about, remember??
E: V.O.
N: LATER, Scott makes small talk with some friends. Already sloppy, talking too close. His parents are there. They say goodnight early, and his Dad leans close.
C: SCOTT’S DAD
D: Happy New Year, son. Take it easy with that.
N: He takes the drink from Scott’s hand as they leave. Scott immediately grabs another one from a passing tray. FIREWORKS EXPLODE IN THE SKY. Everyone OOH and AWWs. Austin stares, transfixed. Scott’s PHONE BUZZES. A text from Teresa. “It’s 11, you on your way?” But he’s too far gone. He pops open a custom beer bottle with a rubber stopper. Fancy. Then he joins his kids on the dance floor. Stumbling in sloppy circles, flailing his arms. Beer in hand. It’s not charming. It’s embarrassing. Logan looks concerned, Austin thinks it’s funny. He dances just as silly. Then Scott gets dizzy and drops the bottle. It SHATTERS on the floor. Ooops.
S: INT. IOWA COUNTRY CLUB - MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Scott stumbles in - propped up by Joe. Joe pushes him against the sinks. Scott slaps him away, slurring.
C: SCOTT
D: Off! Hands off, I’m fine.
N: And they have the fight we first saw as Scott talking to himself.
C: JOE
D: You are lost, my friend, your moral compass is broken. You’re failing as husband and a father.
N: Scott glares back, defiant. But there’s shame behind his eyes.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah? Who are you to judge me?!
N: Before Joe can answer, the door opens and an ELDERLY MAN steps in. Scott straightens.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey man, what’s up. Sweet tie.
E: CONT'D
N: The old man frowns, goes into a stall. Scott turns back.
C: SCOTT
D: I’m going home.
E: CONT'D
N: He takes out his keys, but Joe grabs them. No way. They struggle over the keys.
C: SCOTT
D: Give em back.
E: CONT'D
C: JOE
D: No!
C: SCOTT
D: Give em back!
C: JOE
D: NO! Just cool it.
C: SCOTT
D: I’m fine, I’m still in control.
C: JOE
D: Great. Then let’s just walk back out there, sober up and go home. Ok?
C: SCOTT
D: Ok. I’ll drive.
E: reaches for the keys
C: JOE
D: No, I’m not letting you behind the wheel.
C: SCOTT
D: And I’m not asking your permission.
N: He reaches for the keys, but Joe pulls them away again. Scott throws him against the wall. Angry.
C: SCOTT
D: This is none of your business, Joe! It never is!
E: CONT'D
N: He grabs the keys and heads for the door. Turns around.
C: SCOTT
D: Don’t follow me. I mean it. I’m done with you.
E: CONT'D
N: And he storms out. Joe stands there, like he really wants to follow, but physically can’t. Then the toilet FLUSHES. The old man peeks from stall door.
C: ELDERLY MAN
D: I’m coming out now.
S: INT. IOWA COUNTRY CLUB - PATIO - NIGHT
N: Scott grabs the kids and heads for the parking lot, Austin’s Jester hat bouncing as they go. Joe stands in the crowd, WATCHING THROUGH THE WINDOW, sad, as Scott leads his children to the car. WE SEE IT PLAY OUT FROM JOE’S POV. And this time it’s not funny at all. As Scott falls to the ground, so drunk he can‘t stand up. As the other man hands him his keys. As Austin giggles, clueless, and Logan cries. Scared to death. AS THE CAR DRIVES OFF, the crowd counts down to midnight. “Five, four, three, two, one....”
T: WE CUT TO BLACK:
C: CROWD
D: Happy New Year!!!
E: O.S.
N: SILENCE. For a long beat.
C: AUSTIN
D: Like I said. Sometimes it’s bad when things break, sometimes it’s good. You don’t always know which it’s gonna be.
E: V.O.
N: THEN, from the darkness -- BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT. And WATER. Cascading down in SUPER SLO MOTION. It’s beautiful. Cleansing. Serene. And we SMASH CUT INTO:
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - SCOTT AND TERESA BEDROOM - MORNING
N: A pitcher of cold water dumps on Scott. He bolts up in bed, GASPING. Soaking wet. Still in last night’s clothes. He looks up through swollen eyes and sees: TERESA, standing over him. Furious.
C: TERESA
D: I want you out of this house. NOW!
N: Scott is bleary, confused. No idea what’s happening. He squints, trying to put it together. Suddenly he jumps up -
C: SCOTT
D: The kids!
N: He rushes to the window -- THE CAR IS ON THE LAWN. Crashed through their fence. His brain spins. What did I do??
C: TERESA
D: The kids are fine, they’re in their room. And they’re staying there until you’re gone. I don’t want you near them. Or me. Now get out.
C: SCOTT
D: Teresa....
C: TERESA
D: GET! OUT!!
S: EXT. RENTAL HOUSE - MORNING
N: Scott stumbles from the house, past his wrecked car. He pauses to try to straighten a splintered fence post. Then gives up and walks off down the street, alone.
S: EXT. SCOTT’S PARENTS' HOUSE - DAY
N: Scott’s Mom and Dad stand at the front door as Scott climbs the porch, ashamed.
C: SCOTT
D: I don’t know what to do, I don’t know where to go...
E: PRE-LAP
S: INT. SCOTT’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Scott sits across from them. Head down.
C: SCOTT’S DAD
D: You stay here with us.
N: Scott finally glances at his mother. Knows she’s angry.
C: SCOTT
D: I’m sorry, Mom.
N: Mom picks up a plate. Here we go. But instead of smashing it, she hands it to Scott.
C: SCOTT’S MOM
D: You break it.
N: He hesitates, but she’s not messing around. He shrugs, throws the plate to the floor. It BREAKS into pieces. She points.
C: SCOTT’S MOM
D: Is that you right now?
E: CONT'D
N: Scott nods, eyes filling. Then Mom wraps her arms around him.
C: SCOTT’S MOM
D: Moments like this are what grace is meant for, Scott. It’s not your mistakes that define you, it’s how you heal. How you put the pieces back together. So get to work.
E: CONT'D takes his face in her hands
N: She slaps his face hard. Scott flinches, Hey! Looks to Dad.
C: SCOTT’S DAD
D: What she said.
S: INT. ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS MEETING - DAY
N: Scott sits in the back of an AA meeting, head low, just listening, as they all read together.
C: EVERYONE TOGETHER
D: “An honest regret for harms done, a genuine gratitude for blessings received, and a willingness to try for better things tomorrow...”
S: EXT. FIELD - SUNSET
N: Scott walks beside a long, frosted field. Alone.
S: EXT. PARK - DAY
N: Scott plays at the park with Austin and Logan.
C: AUSTIN
D: When are you coming home?
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 89.
C: SCOTT
D: Not sure yet, Auz Man. I need some time to get better.
N: Austin doesn’t understand. But Logan does. And Scott can barely make eye contact with him.
C: AUSTIN
D: Hey, maybe you should go to the crazy hospital like I did.
C: SCOTT
D: Maybe I should.
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNING
N: Teresa sits with Austin at the table. Home schooling him.
C: TERESA
D: Come on, Auz, stay focused. I’m not just gonna give you the answers.
N: Austin SIGHS, turns back to his book. OFF THIS, we hear MACHINE GUN FIRE.
C: TERESA
D: No way. Not ready, not even close.
E: PRE-LAP CONT'D
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Teresa and Lori play CALL OF DUTY on Xbox. Both of them * BLASTING ENEMY SOLDIERS as they chat.
C: TERESA
D: I just keep thinking of him.... choosing to drink, after everything we talked about. Choosing to get in that car. With our kids. You know what could have happened to them, I can’t even.... So no. God can forgive him if he wants to. Not me. Not now.
E: she shudders
C: LORI
D: I hear that. I do. I’ll just say this, though...
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 90.
C: TERESA *
D: No, don’t try to talk me down, you * kidding me, after everything we * went through? Growing up with this. * I’m not doing it again.... *
C: LORI *
D: That’s not what I’m saying, let me * finish. *
N: Lori lowers her controller. *
C: TERESA *
D: Go ahead. *
C: LORI *
D: All I’m saying is -- You’re not * Mom, T. And Scott’s not Dad. Yeah, * he messed up, but he’s HERE. He * loves you, he loves those kids. And * you know what, I’ll bet he’s * struggling with a lot right now. * But you’ve had your share of struggles, too, be honest.
C: TERESA
D: So?
N: She fires a ROCKET LAUNCHER, blows up a building. YES.
C: LORI
D: So are you gonna struggle together, or struggle apart?
C: TERESA
D: Apart. Definitely. I can’t even look at him, I’d tear his face off, I’m serious.
N: Lori LAUGHS.
C: LORI
D: Alright then. Fair enough.
S: EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING
N: Logan rolls up to school on his new SKATEBOARD. As he kicks up the board, it’s snatched away from behind. He turns.
C: TYLER
D: Happy New Year, Tiny Tim, check out my sweet new board.
C: LOGAN
D: Why are you such a jerk, man? Give it back.
C: TYLER
D: Nah. But you can borrow it sometime.
N: He starts to walk away. Logan grabs the board. Tyler spins around, pushes Logan hard. Logan stumbles back, then charges Tyler, pissed. But Tyler is too big for him. He absorbs the momentum, then punches Logan square in the face. Knocks him to the ground. Logan isn’t done. He charges Tyler, tackling him. Then unleashes, swinging wildly. His punches barely connect, but it’s enough to freak Tyler out. He pushes Logan off.
C: LOGAN
D: What is it with you?? You mess with my brother, you mess with me, WHY?? Do you even see yourself? You’re a cliche, you’re a bully, you’re nothing!
N: By now students have gathered. A TEACHER rushes over. She looks to Logan, surprised.
C: TEACHER
D: Logan? What is this?
C: LOGAN
D: Nothing. He took my skateboard.
N: The teacher turns to Tyler. He shrugs, hands the board over.
C: TYLER
D: Learn to take a joke, man.
N: He walks off, trying to be play it cool. But he’s rattled.
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Teresa puts ice on Logan’s swollen eye. Austin is upset.
C: AUSTIN
D: LOGAN! Why did you hit Tyler??
C: LOGAN
D: He hit ME! Austin, the guy is a total jerk, why do you want to be friends with him so much?
C: AUSTIN
D: Because..... He’s sad.
C: LOGAN
D: He’s WHAT?
C: AUSTIN
D: He’s sad. His Dad’s been in jail for a long, long time, and also his Mom is sick, like really sick with cancer, and I heard they don’t even get to do Christmas. So I think he’s sad. I can see it when I look at him. And that makes me sad.
N: Logan frowns, struck. Then the front door opens and Scott rushes in, already worked up. Sees Logan’s black eye.
C: SCOTT
D: This was Tyler again?
C: LOGAN
D: It’s fine, Dad. I’m okay.
C: SCOTT
D: I’m going to school tomorrow. I’m gonna straighten this kid out.
N: Logan stops him.
C: LOGAN
D: No. Dad. Let me deal with it.
S: INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - MORNING
N: Logan sits across from Teresa and the Principal, ILENE.
C: ILENE
D: You sure you want to do this?
N: Logan nods, and ILENE opens the door. The TEACHER who broke up the fight leads Tyler in. He sees Logan and stops. Logan holds out a large gift, wrapped in Christmas paper.
C: TYLER
D: What is this?
C: LOGAN
D: It’s for you. A late Christmas present.
N: Tyler eyes him and all these adults, wary.
C: TYLER
D: I don’t get it.
C: ILENE
D: It’s okay. Open it.
N: Tyler hesitates, then carefully opens the gift. It’s Logan’s new skateboard. Tyler looks to him. WTF??
C: LOGAN
D: I want you to have it.
C: TYLER
D: Why?!
C: LOGAN
D: I thought... maybe you didn’t have a great Christmas, so...
C: TYLER
D: You what?
N: Tyler stares at him, his face unreadable. Logan fumbles.
C: LOGAN
D: I don’t know, I just wanted you to have that. And I know that’s kind of weird, but -- I guess I’m kind of weird. Anyway... I don’t want to fight with you, I’d rather be friends. Is that okay?
E: totally sincere
N: Tyler’s face goes red. Looks like he’s going to be angry, but instead tears well in his eyes. Tyler lowers his head. After a beat, he nods. And tears fall. From Logan, too. AND FROM TERESA, who couldn’t be more proud of her boy.
S: INT. ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS MEETING - DAY
N: Another day, another meeting. Partway through, Scott looks up and recognizes someone in the group. It’s Preacher Rick. AFTERWARD, Scott approaches him.
C: SCOTT
D: Rick. What are you doing here?
C: PREACHER RICK
D: I’m an alcoholic. You?
E: matter of fact
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 94.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah... uh. Same.
N: First time he’s actually said it. Rick pats his back.
C: PREACHER RICK
D: See you next time.
S: INT. RENTAL HOUSE - MORNING
N: Logan grabs his backpack, ready for school. He looks to Austin, sitting at the dining room table, ready for home schooling. His lizard Marty is his only classmate. It’s sad. Mom sees Logans’s face.
C: TERESA
D: We’ll figure something out. We’ll * find him a good school, don’t worry. *
N: He nods, thinking. Then gives her a quick kiss and heads out.
S: INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY *
N: Logan carries his tray. He spots a group of kids huddled, * whispering and giggling. Hears the word “Austin”, then one of * the kids sees him and they all go quiet. Logan struts over. *
C: LOGAN *
D: Hey, are you talking about my * brother? Do NOT make fun of him. *
N: They all turn, revealing TYLER. Logan eyes him. *
C: TYLER *
D: No man, we weren’t. For real. *
N: But they’re hiding something. Tyler gives Logan a reassuring * look. It’s cool, promise. Then waves the other kids off. He * nods for Logan to join him, offers his brownie as a peace * offering. Wary, Logan accepts. Then sits with Tyler for lunch. *
S: INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY
N: Scott and Teresa meet in the school’s front entrance.
C: SCOTT
D: Do you know what this is about?
N: Teresa shakes her head. No idea. As they walk down the hall -- Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 95.
C: PRINCIPAL
D: Thank you for coming in.
E: PRE-LAP
S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: The principal ILENE sits across from them. They’re both wary.
C: PRINCIPAL
D: I want to talk about Austin. I know you’ve withdrawn him from the resource class.
C: TERESA
D: We’re homeschooling for now. Until we find something else.
N: Ilene nods.
C: SCOTT
D: Look, we know he’s different, Ilene, we’re not delusional. But the thing that makes Austin different is what makes him “special.” And we refuse to hide that away. Or apologize for it. So we’ll find him another school. He does better when he’s around more “typical” kids. They’re his * friends. He learns from them. And I think they learn just as much from him.
E: firm
N: After a beat.
C: ILENE I agree.
D: And you’re right about the other kids. They all love him.
E: she opens a file
N: She slides a stack of loose leaf paper across the desk. Pages and pages of signatures.
C: ILENE
D: It’s a petition. Signed by just about every student in school.
E: CONT'D
N: Scott and Teresa flip through the pages, in shock.
C: ILENE
D: Austin inspires something in people.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: ILENE
D: I think we can all learn from him.
E: CONT'D
C: I know I can.
D: He’s welcome back any time.
E: she smiles
N: From this -- CHEERING.
S: INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - DAY
N: A school rally. Ilene stands before the whole student body.
C: ILENE
D: I have a special announcement. Back by popular demand.... Please give a big, rowdy welcome to the man behind the tiger. Everyone’s favorite mascot, Auz Man!
N: Austin runs out in the tiger costume and everyone FREAKS OUT. MUSIC PLAYS and Austin does his famous Tiger dance. Tyler and Logan run up to join him. Logan wears the Jester hat. He yells to Tyler over the APPLAUSE.
C: LOGAN
D: Hey. Thanks, man. For doing this.
N: Tyler grins.
C: TYLER
D: Don’t know what you mean.
N: He snatches the Jester hat and puts it on. FROM BESIDE THE BLEACHERS, Scott and Teresa take it all in. Scott watches AUSTIN, dancing, laughing, happy as can be. PUSH IN ON SCOTT’S FACE. He smiles, but something in him is unsettled. The rhythm of the drums is slowly replaced by a pensive CLICK, CLICK, CLICK....
C: SCOTT
D: I wish I could enjoy anything as much as my son enjoys everything.
E: PRE-LAP
S: INT. ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS MEETING - DAY
N: Scott speaks. He grips a pen, CLICKING it over and over.
C: SCOTT
D: I’ve always held on so tight to things. I don’t even know why.
E: MORE
C: SCOTT
D: I just need everything to be a certain way...
E: CONT'D
N: Scott looks at his shoes as he talks. He taps his feet to the CLICKS. Twice with the right, twice with the left.
C: SCOTT
D: We talk about “an attitude of gratitude”.... That’s never been me. I’m never content, never have been. I used to think that made me ambitious, but really I’m just.... Ungrateful. I hate that about myself. I push everything away -- everything and everyone I care about.
E: CONT'D he turns inward
N: Scott looks up for the first time. Into the crowd of faces. Rick is there. And then we see -- JOE.
C: SCOTT
D: I don’t want to do that anymore.
E: CONT'D
N: Joe nods. Like he’s accepting an apology. From himself.
C: SCOTT
D: I want to be more like my son.
E: CONT'D
N: He pauses. Taps twice with his left foot. Just once with the right. Stops himself. Waits. Nothing. Huh.
S: EXT. SCOTT’S PARENTS' HOUSE - DAY
N: Scott returns to the house to find Teresa waiting on the front steps. He stops, surprised. Then he waves.
S: INT. SCOTT’S PARENTS' HOUSE - DAY
N: Scott pours coffee. Hands a mug to Teresa. They’re both a little awkward.
C: TERESA
D: So. I wanted to talk about.... the uh -- the camping trip. Is this weekend.
C: SCOTT
D: Right. I figured that was off. That I.... shouldn’t go.
C: TERESA
D: I think you should. Austin is so excited about it.
N: Scott shifts in place, like a child. Working up the nerve.
C: SCOTT
D: T. I’m so sorry. About what I did. And what I didn’t do. About everything. There’s so much I want to say...
N: He chokes, can’t quite look at her. Still filled with shame. Before he can say any more, Teresa takes a step toward him.
C: TERESA
D: You know what I admire about you?
N: Tears immediately well in Scott’s eyes. He shakes his head and turns away. He can’t accept it. But Teresa stands right in front of him, takes his hand.
C: TERESA
D: You’re broken. And lost, and scared, and getting things wrong.... But you keep trying.
E: CONT'D
N: Scott nods, barely holding it together.
C: TERESA
D: You know how I used to wonder if I was the princess or the ugly stepsister? Turns out I’m not either, I’m just a regular mess. And I don’t expect you to be a perfect prince, that would be boring. And it would make me feel super insecure. You’re a good man, Scott, with a good heart. I knew it the moment I met you. You’ve given up a lot for this family, and you’ve never stopped fighting for us. Even now.
E: CONT'D she looks him in the eye
N: Scott cries openly, unable to contain it anymore.
C: TERESA
D: Two month sober. I’m so proud of you.
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: 74 days actually. But to be fair, it only seems like 19 and a half.
N: Teresa LAUGHS out loud.
C: TERESA
D: So yeah, damn right I admire you. And by the way, I’ve been giving this some thought since our wedding. And -- I definitely do love you. So how about we struggle together?
N: He looks at her, relieved. You sure?
C: TERESA
D: I figure if Logan can forgive the school bully, I oughta be able to forgive you.
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: Awww man.
E: then, realizing
N: He goes to a desk in the dining room. Pulls out an 11x7 ADVERTISEMENT.
C: SCOTT
D: So I did all this work for nothing?
E: CONT'D
N: CLOSE ON THE AD: IT’S THE PHOTO BOOTH PICTURE from Scott and Teresa’s first date at the arcade. Teresa’s head on his shoulder. Cheery text reads: FORGIVENESS! Half the price of bitterness, with none of the calories! Teresa cracks up, genuinely impressed.
C: TERESA
D: You made this??
C: SCOTT
D: I thought I was gonna have to sell you on it.
C: TERESA
D: This is really good, Scott! Wait, we don’t have to move to New York now, do we?
C: SCOTT
D: Nah, I’m happy here.
S: EXT. CAMPGROUND - DAY
N: Scott pulls his car into a campground parking lot BUZZING with excited kids. As he and Austin unload -
C: SCOTT
D: Looks like we have to hike a mile or so to the campsite. And the bags are heavy, so if you start to get tired, or your ankles hurt....
N: But Austin is already out of the car, bags on his shoulders, huffing it right along with the other kids. Okay then. Over this - THUNDER CRACKS.
S: INT. SCOTT’S TENT - NIGHT
N: Scott and Rick share a tent. Lightning FLASHES outside. Rain pelts down. Water already leaks onto Scott. He’s miserable.
C: SCOTT
D: I better get Austin. He doesn’t do well with sleepovers, even normal ones. With all this, he’s gonna have a meltdown any second.
C: PREACHER RICK
D: So he melts down. It’s alright.
N: Scott hesitates, then lies back down. Okay, I warned you. He pokes the tent. More water dumps on him. Great.
S: EXT. CAMPGROUND - MORNING
N: The sky is clear. BRIGHT MORNING SUN rises behind the tents.
S: INT. SCOTT’S TENT - MORNING
N: Scott bolts awake to Austin. Fired up and ready to go.
C: AUSTIN
D: Dad! What’s up? What an awesome night. How’d you sleep? Are you ready to rock? What’d you do all night? Do you love these tents? We had a blast. This is going to be great. Are you hungry? I am. Let’s do it, man! By the way, Dad, was that storm cool or what? That was so awesome!
N: And he’s out. Scott and Rick share a look. Morning. SERIES OF EVENTS. Austin and Scott compete with the others: - A RELAY RACE, as dads carry kids on hand-made stretchers. - A SAWING CONTEST, where Scott and Austin race to saw through a foot-thick log with a large two-handled saw. Then... SWISH! - AN ARROW STICKS INTO A TARGET. Just outside the bullseye. WHIP PAN over as the shooter steps aside, making room for his competitor.... AUSTIN. Up next. Austin nocks his arrow, focused. CLOSE ON HIS EYES, he’s in the zone. We see his POV -- The feather, the bow string, the target. Austin breathes, and lets it fly. BULLSEYE! Scott blinks. What?? He can’t believe it. Everyone FREAKS OUT. CHEERING. But Austin is already over it. No big deal.
C: AUSTIN
D: Let’s go, Dad. Time to move on!
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. LAKE - SUNSET
N: Scott and Austin glide across the lake in a canoe. The sun sets over the water. It’s beautiful. Austin is exhausted from the day. So Scott paddles. Austin watches him. Then, out of nowhere.
C: AUSTIN
D: Dad. I wish I was more like you.
N: This stops Scott. He looks at Austin. As hard as it is for him to accept that right now, Austin is completely sincere.
C: SCOTT
D: You do?
C: AUSTIN
D: Course I do, silly goose. You’re the best.
N: AUSTIN GRINS. And his eyes twinkle in that knowing way. As Scott meets his bright blue gaze...
C: AUSTIN
D: Most of the time, Dad can’t see what I see. But that day floating on the lake, he did.
E: V.O.
N: And now WE SEE QUICK FLASHES -- MOMENTS FROM AUSTIN’S LIFE. Some big, some small. Scott holding baby Austin as he cries. Running him heroically into a hospital, time after time. Hiding in the closet - “I found you!”, Scott holding him at the swing set. Speeding after the finance guy, wind whipping his hair. Playing games together, watching movies, laughing, crying.... Most of them are moments Scott considered failures, or forgettable. But through Austin’s eyes - they’re perfect.
C: AUSTIN
D: That day he saw exactly what I see. A great dad.
E: V.O. beat
N: BACK TO CANOE. Scott is struck. He smiles at his son through happy tears. FROM THIS, WE PULL OUT to reveal they’re no longer floating on water, but in a sea of radiant, magical clouds. In Austin’s imagination.
C: AUSTIN
D: You see it, Dadio?
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, Auz Man. I sure do.
N: And this time, he really does.
S: EXT. CAMPGROUND - NIGHT
N: Everyone gathers around a CRACKLING FIRE. Chatting, singing, making s’mores. The lake reflects a million stars. Scott strums his guitar. Beside him, Austin lays his head down, immediately asleep. Rick sits down, joining Scott. They stare into the fire for a beat.
C: SCOTT
D: You know, I didn’t want to come on this trip, I wanted to stay home. I almost missed all this.
E: beat
C: PREACHER RICK
D: You made a good choice.
C: SCOTT
D: Guess I owe you one. Or God. Could you tell Him for me?
C: PREACHER RICK
D: Tell him yourself. It’s not that hard.
S: EXT. LAKE - DAWN
N: The sky glows blue. Everyone is asleep in their tents. Scott sits on a rock with Joe, watching the mist over the lake.
C: SCOTT
D: So.... I have a question.
C: JOE
D: Yeah?
C: SCOTT
D: I’ve been talking to you almost all my life. And it just occurred to me. Are you... God?
E: hesitant
N: Joe nods thoughtfully, like he’s been expecting this question.
C: JOE
D: Scott. Look at me. Look at my face, son.
N: Scott does, a little wary. And Joe’s face STARTS GLOWING. Scott stares, eyes wide. The white light seems to overtake Joe’s face until..... IT SNAPS BACK TO NORMAL.
C: JOE
D: No, I’m not God, dimwit.
E: CONT'D
N: Scott shakes his head.
C: JOE
D: Seriously. What did you think was gonna happen there?
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. CAMPGROUND - MORNING
N: The kids and dads all walk back to their cars, loaded up with gear. The kids cluster together, chatting. Dads do the same. Then Austin runs up alongside Scott and takes his hand. They walk together in silence for a moment. Then Austin asks -
C: AUSTIN
D: Whatcha thinkin’, Dadio?
N: Scott shrugs.
C: SCOTT
D: Nothing, really.
N: And as they continue together, hand in hand...
C: AUSTIN
D: But that wasn’t true. Dad told me later he was thinking, “what teenage boy wants to hold his father’s hand?” And you wanna know what he was feeling? Grateful.
E: V.O. beat
N: AT THE CAR, Scott loads Austin, then shuts the door. Looks out over the horizon. Takes a breath. Then -
C: SCOTT
D: Thank you. For everything.
N: Then, from inside the car.
C: AUSTIN
D: Welcome!
E: O.S.
S: INT. BURGER STAR - DAY
N: Scott, Teresa, Austin and Logan all sit together. Burgers and fries for everyone. And for Austin, a LARGE STRAWBERRY MILKSHAKE.
C: AUSTIN
D: You guys, wait. Stop. Look at me!
N: They all look. Except Scott, who is trying to sneak a bite.
C: AUSTIN
D: Dad. Look at me, please, thank you and you’re welcome, this is important!
E: CONT'D
N: Scott can’t help but laugh. But he really wants this burger.
C: AUSTIN
D: Put it down and -- stop what you’re doing and look at me, Dad. You’re not looking!
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: Okay, I’m looking, I’m looking. What is so important?
N: Austin takes another big sip of his shake, then, blissfully:
C: AUSTIN
D: This shake, oh my gosh, this is the best strawberry shake I’ve ever had! You have to believe me.
N: They all smile, but Austin isn’t done.
C: AUSTIN
D: The texture, the smoothness, it is so creamy and, oh man, it’s just like heaven. I know milkshakes are great, but this one is perfection. Do you get it?! The shake makes the deal. It makes everything better, everything!
E: CONT'D
N: Then he screams it out.
C: AUSTIN
D: This is the best day of my life!
E: CONT'D
N: The whole restaurant turns. But Austin is done now. Back to his shake. Scott and family just smile. As Scott finally takes his bite, we PUSH IN ON HIM, and now IT’S HIS VOICE THAT COMES IN.
C: SCOTT
D: I believe Austin, that it really was the best milkshake ever. Because to Austin, every milkshake can be the best milkshake. Every day can be the best day. Every moment, the best moment. You just have to be able to see it.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
N: Scott drives his family home. He looks to the back seat, where Austin sits with his face out the window, Jester hat flapping in the wind, sun on his face. Happy as can be.
C: SCOTT
D: Until that day, I spent most of my son’s life trying to figure him out. So I could fix him. But it turns out he wasn’t broken at all. He didn’t need me to fix him. I needed him to fix me. That’s a true fact.
E: V.O.
N: Scott adjusts the rearview, SO HE CAN SEE HIS WHOLE FAMILY AS HE DRIVES. Teresa in the passenger seat. Austin and Logan in the back. And between then, Joe. Scott smiles.
C: SCOTT
D: Look. See this moment. Right here? Best moment of my life.
E: V.O. beat
T: AND WE CUT TO BLACK
