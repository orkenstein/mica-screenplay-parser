D:           Hey man, what’s up. Sweet tie.

D:           Just cool it. You’re fine, you’re

D:           pancakes, Batman, SpongeBob, Back
D:           to The Future, chicken nuggets and
D:           ranch dressing. Ranch dressing is
D:           the bomb! I’m really good at video
D:           games, especially Call of Duty, and
D:           I have a killer DVD collection, and
D:           also a shoelace collection and a
D:           hat collection. Wearing just the
D:           right hat makes my day.

C:                      AUSTIN (V.O.)
D:           I have a condition called
D:           Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Those are
D:           big words, but it basically means
D:           my bones break easy. I’ve broken my
D:           arms, my nose, my ribs, my head, my
D:           legs, my feet, pretty much
D:           everything. It kinda stinks, but
D:           you get used to it. I also have
D:           autism. Some autistic kids can’t
D:           talk, but I sure can! I have a pet
D:           lizard named Marty, and I love 80s
D:           rock music and I might have told
D:           you also ranch dressing. But hold
D:           on, I don’t want to lose my train
D:           of thought...

0: 
N: OUTSIDE, he leads them to the car. Austin mimics his dad’s
N: drunken walk, thinks it’s hilarious.
0: 
N: CLOSE ON AUSTIN. He fixates on his hat’s colorful pom poms,
N: bouncing with every step. Then Scott trips, falls to the
N: ground. He lays there in the gravel, LAUGHING kind of crazy.
N: Austin LAUGHS, too. But Logan is worried.

S: EXT. BLUE SKY - DAY
0: 
N: Austin is FLYING. He sails through the air like a super hero,
N: backlit by the orange afternoon sun. Jester hat fluttering.
0: 
N: Then Scott flies beside him. No wires, no tricks, these guys
N: are flying! And to make it even cooler, A SUPER HERO THEME
N: PLAYS. It’s magical, and AUSTIN’S FACE BEAMS with pure joy.

S: EXT. PARK SWING SET - SUNSET
0: 
N: They’re on swings. Logan pushes Austin and Scott, one at a
N: time. Higher and higher. Austin is LOVING IT.
0: 
N: Then Logan pushes Scott really hard and runs under his swing.
N: He doubles back and does it again.

N: Scott grins, then hesitates. Something isn’t right.

C:                        AUSTIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
D:           Higher!
0: 
N: As Scott realizes, the fantasy crumbles.
0: 
N: BACK TO REALITY. Austin pushes Scott now. As Scott’s swing

C:                        SCOTT
D:           AUZ, NO!!!
0: 
N: Austin isn’t fast enough, and Scott swings back down,
N: SMASHING into Austin’s little body like a freight train.
0: 
N: There’s a THUD, then a horrible CRACK. Scott lands on top of
N: Austin with his full weight.
0: 
N: Austin is already BAWLING, his mouth wide open but no sound

N: body. Austin stares back at him, in shock.

D:           Daddy, I can’t move. Why did you do

C:                     AUSTIN
D:           I’m sorry, Daddy. I just wanted to

0: 
N: But his eyes betray him. He’s terrified.
0: 
N: IN A FEW HORRIBLE FLASHES, we see AUSTIN’S POV, DREAMLIKE:

N: - PARAMEDICS LEAN OVER HIM, loading him onto a stretcher.
0: 
N: - IN AN AMBULANCE, Scott covers his face, stifling sobs.
0:

D:              the nurses, reassuring them he’s
D:              fine. He’ll need to wear the cast
D:              for a few months while the
D:              vertebrae heal. But as you can see,
D:              he doesn’t seem to mind too much.

0: 
N: LATER, Scott makes small talk with some friends. Already

C:                      SCOTT’S DAD
D:           Happy New Year, son. Take it easy

0: 
N: FIREWORKS EXPLODE IN THE SKY. Everyone OOH and AWWs. Austin
N: stares, transfixed.
0: 
N: Scott’s PHONE BUZZES. A text from Teresa. “It’s 11, you on
N: your way?” But he’s too far gone. He pops open a custom beer
N: bottle with a rubber stopper. Fancy.
0: 
N: Then he joins his kids on the dance floor. Stumbling in
N: sloppy circles, flailing his arms. Beer in hand. It’s not
N: charming. It’s embarrassing. Logan looks concerned, Austin
N: thinks it’s funny. He dances just as silly.
0: 
N: Then Scott gets dizzy and drops the bottle. It SHATTERS on
N: the floor. Ooops.

C:                     SCOTT
D:           And I’m not asking your permission.
0: 
N: He reaches for the keys, but Joe pulls them away again. Scott

D:           This is none of your business, Joe!
D:           It never is!
0:

0: 
N: Joe stands in the crowd, WATCHING THROUGH THE WINDOW, sad, as
N: Scott leads his children to the car.
0: 
N: WE SEE IT PLAY OUT FROM JOE’S POV. And this time it’s not
N: funny at all. As Scott falls to the ground, so drunk he can‘t
N: stand up. As the other man hands him his keys. As Austin

D:           The kids!

0: 
C:                     AUSTIN
D:           He’s sad. His Dad’s been in jail
D:           for a long, long time, and also his
D:           Mom is sick, like really sick with
D:           cancer, and I heard they don’t even
D:           get to do Christmas. So I think
D:           he’s sad. I can see it when I look
D:           at him. And that makes me sad.

0: 
N: Tyler’s   face goes red. Looks like he’s going to be angry, but

D:           the thing that makes Austin

E:                (firm)
D:           So we’ll find him another school.

S: EXT. CAMPGROUND - DAY
0: 
N: Scott pulls his car into a campground parking lot BUZZING
N: with excited kids. As he and Austin unload -
0: 
C:                     SCOTT
D:           Looks like we have to hike a mile
D:           or so to the campsite. And the bags
D:           are heavy, so if you start to get
D:           tired, or your ankles hurt....
0: 
N: But Austin is already out of the car, bags on his shoulders,
N: huffing it right along with the other kids. Okay then.
0: 
N: Over this - THUNDER CRACKS.

S: INT. SCOTT’S TENT - NIGHT
0: 
N: Scott and Rick share a tent. Lightning FLASHES outside. Rain
N: pelts down. Water already leaks onto Scott. He’s miserable.
0: 
C:                     SCOTT
D:           I better get Austin. He doesn’t do
D:           well with sleepovers, even normal
D:           ones. With all this, he’s gonna
D:           have a meltdown any second.
0: 
C:                     PREACHER RICK
D:           So he melts down. It’s alright.
0: 
N: Scott hesitates, then lies back down. Okay, I warned you. He
N: pokes the tent. More water dumps on him. Great.

C:                     AUSTIN
D:           Dad! What’s up? What an awesome
D:           night. How’d you sleep? Are you
D:           ready to rock? What’d you do all
D:           night? Do you love these tents? We
D:           had a blast. This is going to be
D:           great. Are you hungry? I am. Let’s
D:           do it, man! By the way, Dad, was
D:           that storm cool or what? That was
D:           so awesome!

N: And he’s out. Scott and Rick share a look. Morning.
0: 
N: SERIES OF EVENTS. Austin and Scott compete with the others:
0: 
N: - A RELAY RACE, as dads carry kids on hand-made stretchers.
0: 
N: - A SAWING CONTEST, where Scott and Austin race to saw
N: through a foot-thick log with a large two-handled saw.
0: 
N: Then... SWISH!
0: 
N: - AN ARROW STICKS INTO A TARGET. Just outside the bullseye.
0: 
N: WHIP PAN over as the shooter steps aside, making room for his
N: competitor.... AUSTIN. Up next.
0: 
N: Austin nocks his arrow, focused. CLOSE ON HIS EYES, he’s in
N: the zone. We see his POV -- The feather, the bow string, the
N: target. Austin breathes, and lets it fly.
0: 
N: BULLSEYE!
0: 
N: Scott blinks. What?? He can’t believe it. Everyone FREAKS
N: OUT. CHEERING. But Austin is already over it. No big deal.
0: 
C:                       AUSTIN (CONT'D)
D:             Let’s go, Dad. Time to move on!

S: EXT. LAKE - SUNSET
0: 
N: Scott and Austin glide across the lake in a canoe. The sun
N: sets over the water. It’s beautiful.
0: 
N: Austin is exhausted from the day. So Scott paddles. Austin
N: watches him. Then, out of nowhere.
0: 
C:                       AUSTIN
D:             Dad. I wish I was more like you.
0: 
N: This stops Scott. He looks at Austin. As hard as it is for
N: him to accept that right now, Austin is completely sincere.
0: 
C:                       SCOTT
D:             You do?
0: 
C:                       AUSTIN
D:             Course I do, silly goose. You’re
D:             the best.
0: 
N: AUSTIN GRINS. And his eyes twinkle in that knowing way. As
N: Scott meets his bright blue gaze...

C:                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
D:           Most of the time, Dad can’t see
D:           what I see. But that day floating
D:           on the lake, he did.
0: 
N: And now WE SEE QUICK FLASHES -- MOMENTS FROM AUSTIN’S LIFE.
N: Some big, some small.
0: 
N: Scott holding baby Austin as he cries. Running him heroically
N: into a hospital, time after time. Hiding in the closet - “I
N: found you!”, Scott holding him at the swing set. Speeding
N: after the finance guy, wind whipping his hair. Playing games
N: together, watching movies, laughing, crying....
0: 
N: Most of them are moments Scott considered failures, or
N: forgettable. But through Austin’s eyes - they’re perfect.
0: 
C:                      AUSTIN (V.O.)
D:           That day he saw exactly what I see.
E:               (beat)
D:           A great dad.
0: 
N: BACK TO CANOE. Scott is struck. He smiles at his son through
N: happy tears.
0: 
N: FROM THIS, WE PULL OUT to reveal they’re no longer floating
N: on water, but in a sea of radiant, magical clouds. In
N: Austin’s imagination.
0: 
C:                     AUSTIN
D:           You see it, Dadio?
0: 
C:                     SCOTT
D:           Yeah, Auz Man. I sure do.
0: 
N: And this time, he really does.

0: 
S: EXT. CAMPGROUND - NIGHT
0: 
N: Everyone gathers around a CRACKLING FIRE. Chatting, singing,
N: making s’mores. The lake reflects a million stars.
0: 
N: Scott strums his guitar. Beside him, Austin lays his head
N: down, immediately asleep. Rick sits down, joining Scott.
0: 
N: They stare into the fire for a beat.
0: 
C:                      SCOTT
D:           You know, I didn’t want to come on
D:           this trip, I wanted to stay home.
E:               (beat)
D:           I almost missed all this.

C:                     SCOTT
D:           Guess I owe you one. Or God. Could
D:           you tell Him for me?
0: 
C:                     PREACHER RICK
D:           Tell him yourself. It’s not that
D:           hard.

S: EXT. LAKE - DAWN
0: 
N: The sky glows blue. Everyone is asleep in their tents. Scott
N: sits on a rock with Joe, watching the mist over the lake.
0: 
C:                     SCOTT
D:           So.... I have a question.
0: 
C:                     JOE
D:           Yeah?
0: 
C:                     SCOTT
D:           I’ve been talking to you almost all
D:           my life. And it just occurred to me.
E:               (hesitant)
D:           Are you... God?
0: 
N: Joe nods thoughtfully, like he’s been expecting this question.
0: 
C:                     JOE
D:           Scott. Look at me. Look at my face,
D:           son.
0: 
N: Scott does, a little wary. And Joe’s face STARTS GLOWING.
N: Scott stares, eyes wide. The white light seems to overtake
N: Joe’s face until..... IT SNAPS BACK TO NORMAL.
0: 
C:                     JOE (CONT'D)
D:           No, I’m not God, dimwit.
0: 
N: Scott shakes his head.
0: 
C:                     JOE (CONT'D)
D:           Seriously. What did you think was
D:           gonna happen there?

S: EXT. CAMPGROUND - MORNING
0: 
N: The kids and dads all walk back to their cars, loaded up with
N: gear. The kids cluster together, chatting. Dads do the same.

0: 
0: 
N: Then Austin runs up alongside Scott and takes his hand. They
N: walk together in silence for a moment. Then Austin asks -
0: 
C:                     AUSTIN
D:           Whatcha thinkin’, Dadio?
0: 
N: Scott shrugs.
0: 
C:                     SCOTT
D:           Nothing, really.
0: 
N: And as they continue together, hand in hand...
0: 
C:                      AUSTIN (V.O.)
D:           But that wasn’t true. Dad told me
D:           later he was thinking, “what
D:           teenage boy wants to hold his
D:           father’s hand?” And you wanna know
D:           what he was feeling?
E:               (beat)
D:           Grateful.
0: 
N: AT THE CAR, Scott loads Austin, then shuts the door. Looks
N: out over the horizon. Takes a breath. Then -
0: 
C:                     SCOTT
D:           Thank you. For everything.
0: 
N: Then, from inside the car.

S: INT. BURGER STAR - DAY

N: Scott, Teresa, Austin and Logan all sit together. Burgers and
N: fries for everyone. And for Austin, a LARGE STRAWBERRY
N: MILKSHAKE.
0: 
C:                     AUSTIN
D:           You guys, wait. Stop. Look at me!
0: 
N: They all look. Except Scott, who is trying to sneak a bite.
0: 
C:                     AUSTIN (CONT'D)
D:           Dad. Look at me, please, thank you and
D:           you’re welcome, this is important!
0: 
N: Scott can’t help but laugh. But he really wants this burger.

C:                     AUSTIN (CONT'D)
D:           Put it down and -- stop what you’re
D:           doing and look at me, Dad. You’re
D:           not looking!
0: 
C:                     SCOTT
D:           Okay, I’m looking, I’m looking.
D:           What is so important?
0: 
N: Austin takes another big sip of his shake, then, blissfully:
0: 
C:                     AUSTIN
D:           This shake, oh my gosh, this is the
D:           best strawberry shake I’ve ever
D:           had! You have to believe me.
0: 
N: They all smile, but Austin isn’t done.
0: 
C:                     AUSTIN (CONT'D)
D:           The texture, the smoothness, it is
D:           so creamy and, oh man, it’s just
D:           like heaven. I know milkshakes are
D:           great, but this one is perfection.
D:           Do you get it?! The shake makes the
D:           deal. It makes everything better,
D:           everything!
0: 
N: Then he screams it out.
0: 
C:                     AUSTIN (CONT'D)
D:           This is the best day of my life!
0: 
N: The whole restaurant turns. But Austin is done now. Back to
N: his shake. Scott and family just smile.
0: 
N: As Scott finally takes his bite, we PUSH IN ON HIM, and now
N: IT’S HIS VOICE THAT COMES IN.
0: 
C:                     SCOTT (V.O.)
D:           I believe Austin, that it really
D:           was the best milkshake ever.
D:           Because to Austin, every milkshake
D:           can be the best milkshake. Every
D:           day can be the best day. Every
D:           moment, the best moment. You just
D:           have to be able to see it.

S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
0: 
N: Scott drives his family home. He looks to the back seat,
N: where Austin sits with his face out the window, Jester hat
N: flapping in the wind, sun on his face. Happy as can be.

C:                     SCOTT (V.O.)
D:           Until that day, I spent most of my
D:           son’s life trying to figure him
D:           out. So I could fix him. But it
D:           turns out he wasn’t broken at all.
D:           He didn’t need me to fix him. I
D:           needed him to fix me. That’s a true
D:           fact.
0: 
N: Scott adjusts the rearview, SO HE CAN SEE HIS WHOLE FAMILY AS
N: HE DRIVES. Teresa in the passenger seat. Austin and Logan in
N: the back. And between then, Joe. Scott smiles.
