0: 
N: Kids at lunch. Noisy with bursts of shouting and laughter.
N: Tables all crowded. All except one table toward the back...
0: 
N: It’s here we find those few kids who don’t fit in. Together
N: but alone, empty spaces between seats, books and phones for
N: company. JULIAN (12) eats his lunch and stares at his phone,
N: but can’t help feeling the stares from some of the kids at
N: other tables. A few WHISPER about him. Others SNICKER.

N: Julian shakes his head, returning his attention to his phone.
0: 
N: Caroline regards him a beat, then shrugs and moves on to the
N: next kid at the table. Julian tries to ignore the sound of
N: her sales pitch, returning his focus to --
0: 
N: HIS PHONE. We see he’s scrolling through Instagram: lots of
N: posts from the “Beecher Prep Science Fair!”
0: 
N: Julian’s expression tells us he knows these kids. They all
N: look to be having a great time, laughing and silly-posing for
N: the camera; a Wonder fan will recognize some of the names
N: tagging these photos: “SUMMER” “MAYA” “MILES” “XIMENA”...
0: 
N: Julian swallows hard, trying to ignore whatever emotions the
N: posts elicit as he continues to scroll... when he stops at
N: one image: a boy with a severe facial deformity mugging
N: goofily for the camera with two friends, their arms around
N: each other’s shoulders: “AUGGIE” “HENRY” “JACK WILL.”
0: 
N: Julian stares hard at the threesome; at Auggie in particular.
N: His expression darkens as he types: “Losers.”
0: 
N: He’s about to hit “Post” on his comment -- but hesitates.
N: Torn, he finally erases it, swallowing his irritation.

D:           Careful, it’s slippery.
0: 
N: Sara’s fancy red shoes look wrecked now, their slippery soles
N: sliding from stone to stone. Tourteau’s crutches navigate
N: the wet rocks deftly; he’s clearly cold but not letting on.

D:           I have a job at the Cinema Mernuit,

D:           I’ve seen you there.
0: 
C:                     SARA
D:           Oh.
0: 
N: His friendly smile falters awkwardly as he realizes that
N: sounded a little stalker-ish --
0: 
N: -- when the headlamp of a loud motorcycle comes speeding
N: toward them. Tourteau quickly hurries Sara alongside the
N: nearest house, the pair crouching low as the motorcycle ROARS
N: past. They wait until the street is dark and still again.

C:                     TOURTEAU
D:           See that house, end of the street?
E:               (off her nod)
D:           That’s ours. Only I’m thinking it
D:           might not be safe for you to stay
D:           there. There’s a nosy old couple
D:           who live right above us. My father
D:           thinks they’re Nazi informants.
0: 
N: He looks back at her, trying to sound assuring.
0: 
C:                     TOURTEAU (CONT'D)
D:           There’s an old barn just across the
D:           field. You’ll be safer there.
0: 
N: He leans out from where they’re concealed, checks both ways
N: to make sure no one is watching.
0: 
C:                     TOURTEAU (CONT'D)

N: A wooden door creaks open and Tourteau leads Sara inside.

N: shadows and moonglow. Cobwebs cling to rusty tools and an
N: old car. A mouse scurries over Sara’s foot; she GASPS!

E:               (off his look)
D:           That. That sound.

D:           Oh, um - that would be the bats.
D:           They nest in the rafters sometimes.
D:           They’re harmless though, I swear.

E:               (realizing)
D:           ...Only there’s no ladder. Right.
E:               (quickly)

D:           I’m stronger than I look.

N: herself up into the loft. Tourteau stands, peers up at her.
0: 
C:                     TOURTEAU (CONT'D)
D:           We’ll stack some hay bales along

D:           completely.

D:           it’s very important that you not
D:           come down from the loft for any
D:           reason. Julien explained to you
D:           about our neighbors, the Lafleurs;

D:           Last week I had a tooth pulled, and
D:           the doctor gave me sleeping powder
D:           for the pain. I had a little extra -

D:           So Maman put it in the Lafleurs’

D:           But of course!
0: 
N: Jean-Paul turns on the little radio, careful to keep the
N: volume low. We hear the sound of a big band playing the Duke
N: Ellington ballad “In a Sentimental Mood.”

E:               (taking Vivienne’s hand)

D:           Monsieur?
0: 
N: Julien turns to find Sara before him, holding out a hand,
N: smiling but a little nervous herself.
0: 
N: Julien hesitates - then sets his crutches aside, allows her
N: to help him to his feet... and they dance, he with crutches.
0: 
N: Sara can feel Julien’s body trembling with the effort
N: required to dance without crutches, and does her best to keep
N: him supported without making him self-conscious.
0: 
N: Their faces are quite close, Julien holding his breath,
N: taking in her smell, her proximity. She leans in to him.

D:              Jean-Paul!

N: He looks up to find the Sewer Worker who witnessed Julien’s

S: INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: Vincent enters, stalking through the barn, automatic rifle in
N: hand, a predatory grin on his handsome face.
0: 
N: IN THE HAYLOFT
0: 
N: Hiding in the bales, Sara holds her breath, terrified,
N: listening to his boots clomping through the barn below.
0: 
N: BELOW
0: 
N: Vincent takes his time, savoring the hunt. He raises his gun
N: and UNLEASHES A THUNDEROUS ROUND OF GUNFIRE into the old car,
N: shattering the windows and punching holes in its rusty sides.
0: 
N: IN THE HAYLOFT
0: 
N: Sara shudders at the concussive noise, clutching herself
N: tighter, when:
0: 
C:                     VINCENT (O.S.)
E:               (calling out, below)
D:           It’s Sara, right? The little
D:           missing Jewess.
0: 
N: Sara’s terror spiking, eyes gripped in fear...
0: 
N: BELOW
0: 
N: Vincent prowls, scanning the barn.
0: 
C:                     VINCENT (CONT'D)
D:           I know you’re in here. Come out
D:           now and I won’t hurt you, I swear.
0: 
N: Vincent’s eyes land on the loft. Whatever’s up there is
N: concealed by the stacks of hay bales. Vincent smirks...
0: 
N: Then whips his gun up and fires a spray of automatic rounds
N: up at the loft, the majority of them punching holes in the
N: barn’s ceiling. Dozens of light beams spill in from above.

0: 
N: ON SARA
0: 
N: Petrified. Beams strafe the shadows in which she’s hidden.
N: She peers up through the hay bales, listening in horror...
0: 
N: ... to the sound of Vincent starting to climb up on the
N: barrel that allows access to the loft...
0: 
N: ON VINCENT
0: 
N: Rifle strapped across his back, he reaches for the hayloft
N: ledge to pull himself up --
0: 
N: -- when Sara’s foot comes down hard on his knuckles!
0: 
C:                     VINCENT (CONT'D)
D:              AH!
0: 
N: Vincent falls back down to the barn floor.   Above him he can
N: hear Sara scrambling --
0: 
N: IN THE HAYLOFT
0: 
N: Sara frantically climbs up a post and punches at the holes in
N: the roof, creating a hole large enough to crawl up through...
0: 
N: She reaches up and does just that -- as around her more
N: gunshots shred the hayloft and the roof!

0: 
S: EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: Sara bolts along the rooftop to the edge -- and JUMPS --
0: 
N: -- landing with a hard THUD on the muddy ground below.    She
N: leaps to her feet and takes off in a sprint when --
0: 
N: BANG! The barn door slams open behind her, then the sound of
N: MORE GUNSHOTS! Sara refuses to glance back, sprinting with
N: all her might toward the treeline beyond!

S: EXT. WOODS (THE MERNUIT) - DAY
0: 
N: Sara bolting through the maze of trees, nearly tumbling over
N: roots, branches ripping at her arms.
0: 
N: Running... Running... Running... she gasps for breath,
N: desperately searching for the best path to escape...
0: 
N: She clambers down an incline --
0: 
N: -- and abruptly freezes.   Follow her gaze up ahead to find...

0: 
0: 
N: A LARGE WOLF. The ferocious-looking creature is rooting
N: through something in the wet leaves, temporarily distracted.
0: 
N: Sara holds her breath, backing away as noiselessly as she
N: can...
0: 
N: Then breaks into a run again, searching for another direction
N: to flee... when she hears the sound of rapid boot-fall coming
N: closer!
0: 
N: She looks around, terrified of being spotted --
0: 
N: -- she does the only thing she can: ducks behind the biggest
N: tree she can find, her back pressed against its large trunk.
0: 
N: VINCENT
0: 
N: Jogs into view, automatic rifle raised. He scans the trees
N: around him, knows she couldn’t have gotten far.
0: 
C:                     VINCENT
D:           You shouldn’t have run, Jew girl!
0: 
N: He OPENS FIRE into the trees, shredding trunks, the gunshots
N: echoing eerily throughout the Mernuit.
0: 
N: SARA
0: 
N: Shuts her eyes, knows it’s only a matter of time before he
N: finds her - and if she runs, he’ll shoot her for sure...
0: 
N: VINCENT
0: 
N: Still firing with abandon, until the CLIK-CLIK-CLIK sound
N: tells him his magazine is spent.
0: 
N: He ejects it, hunting in his belt for a fresh one --
0: 
N: -- when Sara bolts from behind the tree and makes a run for
N: it! Vincent laughs cruelly and sprints after her, hot on her
N: tail...
0: 
N: Sara running as hard as she can, stealing just a glance back -
N: when her foot snags a root and she goes flying, hitting the
N: ground hard! She frantically starts to pick herself up --
0: 
C:                     VINCENT (CONT'D)
D:           Don’t.
0: 
N: Sara freezes, peers up to find Vincent is only some 20 yards
N: away. She’s trapped. He stalks toward her, taking his time
N: freeing his magazine from his belt, loading it into his
N: weapon with an ominous CH-CHHUNK.
0: 0:                                                            92.

C:                     VINCENT (CONT'D)
D:           So. That’s where you were all this
D:           time. Hiding in Tourteau’s barn.
E:               (sneers)
D:           He’ll have to answer for that.
0: 
N: Sara peers up at him, and somehow through her terror and
N: despair, her anger fights through and she finds her voice:
0: 
C:                      SARA
D:           His name is Julien... And he saved
D:           your life.
0: 
N: Vincent frowns, what the hell’s she talking about?
0: 
C:                     SARA (CONT'D)
D:           That day... at the cinema... you
D:           would have been shot dead if it
D:           wasn’t for him.
0: 
N: Vincent scoffs - he doesn’t believe her, nor does he care.
0: 
C:                     VINCENT
E:               (grimly)
D:           Get up.
0: 
N: Sara hesitates --
0: 
C:                     VINCENT (CONT'D)
D:           NOW!
0: 
N: She gets to her feet, glaring, scared but defiant.
0: 
C:                     VINCENT (CONT'D)
D:           Hands behind your head. Do it.
0: 
N: Sara raises her hands, puts them behind her head.
0: 
C:                      VINCENT (CONT'D)
D:           Turn around.
E:               (beat)
D:           I said TURN AROUND!
0: 
N: Sara stares back at him, realizes he’s going to shoot her.
0: 
C:                     SARA
D:           Coward.
0: 
N: She turns her back to him, and takes a steadying breath,
N: realizing she’s about to die.
0: 
N: She hears Vincent’s shallow breathing... the rustle of his
N: gun against his shirt... a short inhalation as he raises its
N: stock to shoot -- then another noise -- like a SNARL?
0: 0:                                                              93.
0: 
0: 
N: VINCENT HEARS IT TOO. Surprised, his eyes dart to the sound --
0: 
N: -- glimpsing for only a split second the huge wolf to his
N: left! Vincent whips his gun toward the animal --
0: 
N: -- as the WOLF LUNGES, Vincent’s gunfire too wild and too
N: late as the wolf lands on him and sends him tumbling under
N: its weight, its ferocious jaws gnashing at him --
0: 
N: SARA BOLTS FOR COVER behind the nearest tree, unable to watch
N: as she hears the wolf mauling Vincent. Another quick burst
N: of gunfire, an injured HOWL from the animal... and then she
N: hears it limping away.
0: 
N: The Mernuit goes eerily still. Sara stays frozen a moment,
N: then braves a look. She can just make out Vincent’s body
N: lying in the wet leaves.
0: 
N: Sara pads closer, can now see Vincent has been fatally
N: mauled, gasping his dying breaths, eyes wide and unblinking.
0: 
N: Horrified, Sara is about to flee -- when she sees something
N: in the leaves where Vincent had first been knocked down:
N: Julien’s book bag?
0: 
N: Alarmed, she rushes to pick it up, finds her sketchbook
N: inside. All at once, she puts it together and knows the
N: worst has happened...

0: 
N: The world is almost eerily tranquil, grass rustling in the
N: breeze, the old stone barn visible in the distance... when
N: Sara comes racing into view, running as hard as she can.
0: 
N: She blows right past the barn, not thinking of her own
N: safety, not thinking of anything but Julien’s welfare --

S: EXT. STREET/ BEAUMIER'S MULTI-FAMILY HOME - DAY
0: 
N: Sara races along the same street she’s been observing for a
N: year now, the one Julien takes home from school each day...
0: 
N: Up ahead is the Beaumier’s home.    Sara rushes across the
N: street --
0: 
N: -- a CAR HORN BLARES as she’s nearly hit by a farm truck
N: hauling potatoes! Sara gasps, the DRIVER staring back at her
N: suspiciously through his windshield.

0: 
0: 
N: Sara acts like she lives here, continues to the Beaumier’s.
0: 
N: She tries the door.   Locked.   She BANGS twice.   No answer.
0: 
N: She looks around -- spies a trellis along the side of the
N: building, and a window open just a crack on the second floor.
0: 
N: She makes for it, careful to act casual as she steals a look
N: back at the farmer’s truck, now idling down the street.

S: INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

S: INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: Still no sign of the Beaumiers. Sara tries another door --
N: it’s locked. She tugs on it harder, but it won’t give.
0: 
N: She turns away, and then notices something on the wall: a
N: faded wedding photograph of a young couple we do not
N: recognize - definitely not Vivienne and Jean-Paul...?
0: 
C:                     OLD MAN (O.S.)
D:           Stay where you are.

E:               (under his breath)
D:           Madame...
0: 
N: She glances up to find a young Officer staring furtively at
N: her: it’s Jerome, Vincent’s pal, his expression tinged with
N: guilt. He discreetly signals for them to follow him out --
0: 
N: BY THE ENTRANCE
0: 
N: Vivienne and Jean-Paul wait anxiously as Jerome joins them,
N: his voice hushed and weighted by conscience.
0: 
C:                     JEROME
D:           I know your son. He was taken this
D:           morning. I heard they put him on a
D:           transport truck to Aubervilliers
D:           along with some patients from the

0:

D:           You can still save him. I know the
