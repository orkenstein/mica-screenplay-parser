N: MARTIN
C: BI
D: Couple of ground rules. First thing, we keep together, no wandering off.
N: Nate shoulders his pack. Takes a WALKIE from Martin, who
C: R
D: clips his on his belt.
N: MARTIN

C: NATE K
D: Everything okay?
N: As he comes alongside, we see: EC A GOAT. Standing in the middle of the trail. White. Splattered with mud. A ROPE around its neck.
C: JESS
D: How weird is that? H
N: Mare snaps a picture. LC
C: MARE

N: Martin pulls the rope. The edge is frayed. Torn off. He looks up. SP
C: MARTIN

C: MARE
D: Just the wind. SP
N: But they hear something else now. BUZZING. Martin walks past Mare. A small hill at the opposite side of the village.

E: they turn
C: AS

C: NATE

C: NATE

C: FO MARTIN
D: Hyenas should’ve had at ‘em by now.

N: Then movement, obscured by blades in the wind.
C: AS JESS
D: There you are--
N: Another step and the movement stops. Something looks at her-- we can’t tell what. Jess freezes. A low growl. Then a yip--

D: whatever it was takes off.
N: Behind her, voices yelling her name. But she’s compelled. Young, curious, stupid. She pushes forward. Hands in the grass. An object in front of her. Feels something--
C: R
D: Sticky. Red. Even she knows. Blood. A spray of it. The buzz of flies. Like a siren song. She parts the grass.
C: FO
D: We don’t see what she does, not yet. But her eyes tell the story. Her face drains of color. Pure fucking horror. She opens her mouth to scream--
N: But it never comes. She’s ripped out of frame.

S: EXT. WATERING HOLE - CONTINUOUS
N: EL The size of an olympic swimming pool. A mud beach on the far side. But here, the bush grows almost to the edges. A few CROCODILE slip into the water. But that’s not what gets his attention.

C: R
D: Stay in the Rover. Wait for help to come--
C: FO

C: BI
D: But he needs a key. Doesn’t have it. *
N: A beat. Then: He rips back the carpet. The SPARE tire. The portable jack.
C: R
D: He works fast. Jams the jack inside the lock. Steadies with his foot.
C: FO
D: And cranks. It takes all his strength. Finally:
N: POP. The lock breaks. He opens the BOX. Inside is the * BLACK CASE. He opens the case. * In three pieces. STOCK. CHAMBER. BARREL. Also in the BOX. A zippered pouch. Inside are THREE DARTS. Filled with

D: Just pull the trigger?
N: MARTIN

D: The base of a Marula, about forty meters west of the watering hole. EC
N: Nate scans with SCOPE. We see the tree. The grass between.
C: NATE
D: I see the tree. Alright. H
N: He lowers the radio. Back into the scope. A magnified view as he pans slowly across the Savannah. LC Nothing but the wind and sound of CICADAS. It could be anywhere. Sweat drips into Nate’s eyelashes. He blinks it away. The radio blares. It’s shockingly loud. EL
C: MARTIN
D: Nate.
C: NATE
D: SP
N: Yeah?
C: MARTIN
D: Look for shade. A tree, rocks, anything--
C: NATE

C: BI MARE
D: It’s gonna be okay.
N: BACK TO
C: R
D: Nate. Still scanning. That’s when he hears it. The cicadas have stopped. Even the wind. It’s eerie.
C: FO
D: A new kind of silence. Then:
N: MOVEMENT Hard to tell what. Obscured by the grass. Looks like it’s headed towards the tree, towards Martin--
C: K MARE
D: Dad-- EC
N: He ignores her. Finger on the trigger.
C: NATE
D: Come on-- H
E: to himself
N: Then it emerges. Or rather... they. THREE ANTELOPE. Munching grass. Not a care in the world. Nate relaxes. LC
C: MARE
D: Do you see it?
N: He lowers the scope.
C: NATE
D: EL
N: No. I don’t know. Maybe it’s gone. Maybe it lost interest... But he trails off. Sees something-- SP
C: NATE
D: Wait.
N: He looks through the scope. The antelope are no longer eating. Revision 51. Three heads pointed in the same direction. Their noses stretched into the wind. It’s fucking creepy. He follows their eye line. Panning to his right....
C: AS
D: Slowly, slowly, slowly.
N: THE POV of the scope. He leans to the side. Scope to his right. Nothing but grass and then...
C: BI
D: He stops. Hold.
N: Pans back. Even slower. Slower. Slower. He stops. Something out of focus.
C: R MARE
D: What do you see?
C: FO
D: He reaches for the scope. Turns it. One notch. Two. Three.
N: CLICK. The image in focus. It takes a second to realize. The lion, barely visible in
C: K
D: the grass. Stalking forward.
N: Magnified. EC
C: NATE
D: Shit.
N: The rest happens fast. The lion charges. Nate fires. Misses. H Lowers the scope just in time to see: LC A SHAPE EXPLODE from grass like a heat seeking missile. *
C: NATE
D: GIRLS GET DOWN!
N: Nate rolls. Off the rover. Slams into the dirt. He grunts. EL Stunned. A BEAT. He sees the case with the tranq darts in the dirt. About to SP lunge for them when:
C: MARE
D: DAD. HE’S COMING.
N: Revision 52. A RUSH of MOVEMENT. All Nate can see are it’s legs. He * rolls under the chassis as a paw swipe tears a chunk out of the tire.
C: AS
D: But the lion isn’t done.
N: He jams his head beneath the rover like some possessed monster. Nothing but jaws and blood and spit. * Nate scrambles back, pinned to the ditch, nowhere to go.
C: BI
D: Realizing he’s out of reach, the animal swipes for him.
N: Like a kitten swiping for yarn under a door. Except this is a 1000 pounds of snarling lion under a one ton rover.
C: R
D: Now wedging itself deeper under the rover and closer to Nate. Still out of reach until... The lion’s shoulders, how under the car, begin to LIFT IT--
C: FO
D: INSIDE THE ROVER
N: Mare and Jess are tossed to the side as the vehicle tips. Jess screams.
C: BACK TO K
D: Nate, desperately looking for a way out. EC
N: Then he sees it. His tranq rifle. By his feet. Using his foot, he strains for it. Closer. Closer. Hooks it, pulls it up-- Nate swings the butt of the rifle. WHAM. Into the animal’s H nose. WHAM. WHAM. We hear a crack. The lion reels. THE ROVER SLAMS BACK DOWN LC The girls tossed. In the CHAOS. Nate sees the DART CASE. He scrambles. Half under, half out from the rover. Grabs the case. Rolls back as the animal comes at him again-- EL The lion possessed. Nate fumbles with the case. Opens it. SP Only one dart inside. And it’s shattered. SHIT. The animal growing more frenzied. Wedging itself again. THE ROVER TIPS Revision 53. Mare braces herself. Looks for something, anything, she can use to fight if off as BELOW: SWIPE. A claw connects with NATE’S shoulder. He screams.
C: AS
D: He kicks. Drives himself as far back as he can. Dust and spit and blood everywhere.
N: Recoils from the snapping jaws. Nowhere left to go. The animal is inches from tearing him apart. The rover heaves.
C: BI
D: INSIDE. Mare braces. Then out of the corner of her eye.
N: She sees. Rolling across the floor. THE THIRD DART. BACK TO:
C: R
D: NATE. The animal’s head turned, going for his throat. *
C: FO
D: Those gaping jaws. Nate is fucked. On the verge of being ripped apart. Nothing left to do:
N: But SCREAM. And just as the lion surges, the jaws about to clamp down.
C: K
D: Nate closes his eyes. And....
C: WHAM.
D: EC
N: The lion suddenly pulls back. The rover slam down. And silence. Hold on Nate. The dust. His face covered in it. What the H fuck happened? * He catches his breath. LC Then two feet outside the car. Mare leans down.
C: MARE
D: Dad. EL
N: He looks at her.
C: MARE
D: It’s okay, it’s gone. * SP
N: He nods. Crawls out. To a knee. Still pulsing with adrenaline. Looks at his daughter.
C: NATE
D: What happened?
C: MARE
D: I stuck a dart in its ass.
N: He pulls her to him. Hugs her with everything he’s got.
C: AS
D: Then sees Jess in the open passenger door. Takes her hand.
N: Gathers. Finally:
C: NATE
D: Okay. Let’s go get Martin.

C: R MARTIN
D: Sorry I missed it.
E: O.S.
C: FO
D: INT. ROVER - LATER
N: In the TRUNK. Martin is propped in Mare’s lap. Nate kneels over the wounded leg. All of them are sweating. The safety of the Rover is a fucking sauna. Nate manages a smile.
C: K NATE
D: Just hold still. EC
N: As he cuts away the fabric--
C: MARTIN
D: ....how bad?
N: Our first view of the damage. Shredded skin. Bone. Muscle. H It’s Jess who answers.

E: Martin tries to look
N: (then) Mare-- Come here. Reaching for the aid kit. Forceps. He digs around. Martin yells out.
C: NATE
D: Got it.
N: Pinches the artery. To Mare:
C: AS NATE
D: Hold this. Tight. Don’t let go. I’m gonna tie it off.
E: she does

C: FO MARTIN
D: Can I have water?
N: Nate nods, eases a bit into his mouth. Martin drinks. Lays back. Staring straight up.
C: MARTIN K
D: Okay.
N: Nate goes to work. Martin grits back the pain. It doesn’t EC take long. He bites the sutures with his teeth.
C: NATE
D: You can let go. H
E: to Mare
N: Mare does. No blood pumps. Nate wipes the sweat.
C: MARTIN
D: LC

D: I’m sorry I got you into this... I never should have-- SP
E: fading
C: NATE
D: We’re gonna get you out of here.
C: MARTIN
D: I never should have...
N: And finally, mercifully, he passes out. Mare looks at Nate. Emotional. Tears glisten against the dust on her cheeks. JESS
C: AS
D: Is he gonna be okay?
N: Nate. His hands covered in blood. Sweat soaked.
C: JESS
D: Dad?

N: in less than an hour.

D: What about the lion?
N: Revision 57.
C: NATE
D: The tranquilizer in that dart should keep him out five six hours. We’ll be long gone by then.
C: AS
D: She nods. Looks towards the watering hole.
C: JESS
D: You think it’s the same lion? Killed the people at the village?
C: BI NATE
D: Seems like it.
N: MARE
C: R
D: Why would it do that? Why would it just kill people?
C: FO
D: That’s when Nate sees something that he can’t fucking believe. Out the window, behind her.
C: MARE
D: What’s wrong--
N: But when she follows his eyes, she see what he does. The
C: K
D: lion at the edge of the grass. 20 yards away. His face mucked with dirt and spit and blood--his massive body heaving with rapid breath. Staring right at them. EC
C: NATE
D: I thought you hit him with the dart.
C: MARE
D: H
N: I did. And as this statement lands. Nate’s eyes locked with the LC lion. The monster turns away, as if he just wanted to let them know he’s still there. Off Nate’s look we:

N: Moving idly. Sniffing. Ever so cautiously, Nate eases himself behind a stump. Above, a gust of wind. The crack of branches and the whoosh of leaves. H The lion looks up briefly. Painfully. Nate waits. LC Then the animal passes behind--like a ship in the night. Nate rises slowly, looks back. The animal is gone. But the next step changes everything. EL The radio. Hooked to his belt.

D: We’re in a visitor’s center. National park type photos on the walls. A desk. Behind it is a door marked STORAGE ROOM.
C: FO
D: Two hallways lead back into the building. One door with EMPLOYEES ONLY, the other is open, a sign indicating RESTROOMS this way.
N: Nate immediately crosses to a FIRST AID BOX on the wall. Rips it open. Grabs the KIT--

D: The glare of the sun almost blinding. What they thought was their salvation was something else entirely.
N: Now they’re running into the wide open. And only seconds later. The lion emerges. The grass is
C: K
D: shorter, rockier. Their flight hampered by Mare’s wound, Nate wounds. * EC
N: Luckily the lion is wounded. Not as fast. But pursuing. They reach the lip of hill, stumbling down. A dry river bed beneath. Nate looks. H
C: NATE THERE.
D: LC
N: A SMALL GROVE OF TREES. But they’re blackened, the branches without leaves. Sentinels of the Savannah. Like gravestones. They sprint towards the grove. EL
S: EXT. BLACKENED TREE GROVE - CONTINUOUS

C: THE LION
D: H
N: In full light for the first time. Bigger then we ever could’ve imagined. More horrific after what we’ve been LC through. The worst of creation. Suddenly he stops. Looks up. Nate. Stands in view. His make shift spear. Dirty. Blood stained. EL
C: NATE
D: COME ON.
N: The lion stares at him. Maybe confused. Because there is no SP fear in this man. Nate starts to back away.
C: NATE
D: COME ON GOD DAMNIT.
N: The lion steps forward.
C: NATE
D: That’s it.
C: AS
D: Still backing away, leaving the trees. And Mare. Who we will not see again.
N: Because this is man vs. Lion. A story as old as Africa.
C: BI
D: Suddenly the lions ROARS. And charges.
N: Nate waits for it. As the lion lunges, he dodges. Stabbing the lion, the inertia, causes him to roll, breaking off the knife.
C: R
D: The lion rises.
C: FO
D: Nate still backing away. As they emerge from the grove of trees, he looks behind him. We think we see a glimmer of water. He turns back.
N: The lion shakes off the pain. A little unsure now. Nate breaks the stick over his knee. Two halves. Two sharp ends. Back peddling slowly.
C: K
D: The lion limps forward. Ten feet and keeping the distance. EC
C: NATE
D: DO IT.
N: The lion charges again. Nate tries to dodge. But a paw swipe catches him, even though he manages to impale one of the sticks in the lion’s side. H The animal is up fast. Nate too. Blood pouring from his shoulder. LC Keeps moving backward. The animal charges fast this time. Nate isn’t able to get the stick up before the lion hits him. The speed. The power. Astonishing. He falls under the EL animal’s weight. It bites into his collar bone. Skin, muscle. He SCREAMS. But uses the broken stick to stab into the SP lion’s side, once, twice. The animal reels back-- Nate scrambles up. But he’s really fucking hurt. His arm shredded from the swipe. The other side of his body mauled. Revision 95. He stumbles away from the animal. Holding only the stick. While the lion is hurt. Nate is shredded.
C: AS
D: Woozey. Only a blood stained broken stick.
N: The animal stalks forward. Keeping pace. Nate waves the sick. It’s feeble. The lion swipes. Misses. Nate backs up. He swipes again. Now it’s like the lion is
C: BI
D: toying with him.
N: Almost as if it knows it has the upper hand. The animal’s eyes on him. A low snarl. And for just a
C: R
D: second, we feel something in his animal beyond instinct.
N: We feel hatred.
C: FO
D: This is it... right now.
N: The lion CHARGES. Nate looks up. He lunges. Nate thrusts the stick. The animal lands on top of him. The stick breaking off in
C: K
D: his breast. The lion rolls still in the mud.
N: Nate lays there. Bleeding. Did he just kill this fucking EC lion? He looks up. A second later. The monster rises. Nate turns. No longer has the strength to stand. Drags himself through the mud towards the edge of a WATERING HOLE. The lion slow-walking behind him. H Finally, mercifully, Nate stops. Rolls onto his back. LC There’s something familiar about this place. The rocks. The * trees. We’ve been here before. * If Nate knows it, we can’t tell. The lion approaches. Nate * coughs blood. The shadow of the animal falls over him. EL Nate looks into his eyes. And for a moment it doesn’t attack. It stares at him. And that’s when Nate says the most unexpected thing.
C: NATE
D: SP
N: It’s okay... It’s okay. And just as the lion’s lips curl back. We hear something * coming. A sound in the water. Both the lion and Nate look * up to see: * Revision 96. ANOTHER LION * Racing across the water at full fucking speed. It barrels * into the monster with a ferocious growl. The monster throws *
C: AS
D: it off-- *
N: But a second one comes from the other direction. We won’t * know it until later. But the first was SEPO. The second is * TAVO. *
C: BI
D: Yet we stay with Nate. As these two lions fight the Beast, * who doesn’t stand a chance. *
N: This is nature at its most carnal, primitive. The sounds, * the demonstration of unbelievable strength, these two lions *
C: R
D: dominating the former alpha--doing what Nate could not. *
N: A final paw swipe and a bite to the neck. *
C: FO
