C: TITLE: Osceola, Arkansas *
D: Fall 1932
S: EXT. OLD CLAPBOARD CHURCH - NIGHT
N: A full moon reflects off the Mississippi River. In a clearing not far from its banks sits an old, WOODEN CHURCH. Checking over his shoulder, a BLACK MAN approaches ON FOOT. He knocks on the door. The sound of voices behind the door immediately stop. Nervous - he waits until the door opens a crack.
C: MAN AT DOOR
D: Was you followed?
E: O.C.
N: The Black Man shakes his head. The MAN AT DOOR sticks his head out briefly, surveys the surrounding area. Satisfied, he lets the Black Man inside.
S: INT. OLD CLAPBOARD CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
N: The Black Man enters the cramped, sweaty one room edifice to a meeting already in progress. He finds a seat in the PEWS that are half-filled with Black men. Their haggard, thread bare clothes tell us they are not men of means. The calloused hands, dirt permanently stuck under their nails and worn, sun-hardened faces say they’re field hands. Sitting together among them are ARTHUR GRACE, (40s) heavy-set, strong, earnest and JIMMY TILLMAN (30s) hungry and charismatic with a fire in his eye. At the front of the room, AL MORELAND, (white, late 20s) passionate, idealistic, remains silent until the door is shut again. On a TABLE beside him are several staple-bound LITTLE BLUE BOOKS. Some in the audience thumb through copies.
C: MORELAND
D: You should all have the right to take your harvest directly to market. And shop for the best deal on your equipment...
C: MAN 1
D: Last I checked, suh, they don’t give no rights at all to Black folk. No deals neither.
C: MORELAND
D: That’s why I’m here, sir. We making strides for the working man in Alabama. And we’d like to...
N: Another MAN, LINKWOOD, cuts him off.
C: LINKWOOD
D: No disrespect, Mr. Moreland. This ain’t Alabama. Words Elaine, Arkansas mean anything to you?
N: Murmurs of agreement from the audience. Arthur speaks up.
C: ARTHUR
D: We all know what you think, Linkwood. Let the man say his piece.
N: More mutters of agreement and discord throughout the room.
C: MORELAND
D: Listen. I know what happened in Elaine. I’m working toward a world where we can make sure nothin’ like that ever happens again.
C: LINKWOOD
D: Now he just talkin’ crazy.
N: Linkwood leaves. As do a few others. As the door closes...
C: MORELAND
D: I understand your apprehension. But I promise you, if we can stand together, there is nothing we...
N: As Moreland continues, Jimmy whispers to Arthur.
C: JIMMY
D: They right you know.
C: ARTHUR
D: They yella.
C: JIMMY
D: That don’t mean they ain’t right.
C: ARTHUR
D: You too, Jimmy? Damn.
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 3.
C: JIMMY
D: I ain’t yella. I just don’t see the point of begging for crumbs from Mr. Charlie when we can...
C: ARTHUR
D: Here we go again.
C: JIMMY
D: Get real jobs in...
N: They say it at the same time. But with very different levels of enthusiasm.
C: JIMMY ARTHUR *
D: Chicago! Chicago.
E: CONT’D
C: ARTHUR
D: You act like they ain’t got crackas up there.
E: CONT’D
C: JIMMY
D: I’m sure they do. But the way I hear it them crackas ain’t keeping Negros from voting. From workin’ no jobs.
C: ARTHUR
D: You read The Defender too much. It cain’t be all they say it is.
C: JIMMY
D: Gots to better than here. Ain’t you tired of living like a dog, man?
C: ARTHUR
D: That’s why I’m at this meeting, Jimmy. Man should be able to make his way wherever he call home. You just want to go Chicago cuz yo’ ass don’t like to work.
C: JIMMY
D: These hands wasn’t made to pick cotton.
C: ARTHUR
D: What was they made for, nigga? *
C: JIMMY *
D: I ‘on’t know. I’m aimin’ to find * out. *
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 4. They share a laugh. *
C: MAN 1
D: You hear that?
N: The room falls silent as everyone strains to listen. There is the unmistakeable sound of CAR ENGINES idling. And then... CRAAAAAASSSSHHHHH!!!! A ROCK WRAPPED IN A FLAMING RAG crashes through a BACK WINDOW.
C: MORELAND
D: WAIT! Don’t PANIC!
N: Another FLAMING ROCK SMASHES through the OTHER BACK WINDOW. Pandemonium erupts as EVERYONE SCATTERS. People knock each other over running for the front door. Pews tumble. The table with the Little Blue Books is kicked over. Arthur starts for the front door, but Jimmy pulls him toward the back.
C: JIMMY
D: This way.
N: Jimmy rears up and KICKS the BACK DOOR open
S: EXT. OLD CLAPBOARD CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
N: ...the door flies out SMASHING a white UNION BUSTER in the face. BLOOD GUSHES from his nose. He drops his SHOTGUN. Jimmy dashes past the Union Buster who is cupping his ruined face in his hands. He sprints for the tree line with Arthur.
C: JIMMY
D: C’mon, Arthur!!!
C: UNION BUSTER
D: GET THEM NIGGAS!
N: Several other WHITE UNION BUSTERS emerge from the side of the church and run after Arthur and Jimmy. As they disappear into the tree line, MORE UNION BUSTERS beat the fleeing sharecroppers BLOODY with BATS and STICKS around the front of the church where most of the Union Busters were waiting to attack.
S: EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER
N: Arther and Jimmy tear through the woods. Jimmy is a little ahead of Arthur. Even running through dense foliage lit only by moonlight, there is a precision with which he moves. Arthur not so much. The big man’s FOOT catches on an UPTURNED ROOT. He goes down HARD. Jimmy turns back for him.
C: JIMMY
D: Get up, man. Let’s go.
N: Arthur grimaces as he clutches his ankle.
C: ARTHUR
D: I cain’t. Done twisted it.
C: JIMMY
D: Fuck.
N: Jimmy starts helping him to his feet.
C: ARTHUR
D: Go’on, Jimmy. You cain’t tote my big ass.
C: JIMMY
D: We’ll make for the river. Current carry us downstream faster than we can run.
C: ARTHUR
D: You know I cain’t swim.
C: JIMMY
D: You gon’ learn.
N: He gets him to his feet. Turns to continue, but a WHITE MAN wielding a CROW BAR, blocks their path.
C: WHITE MAN
D: Only thing you niggas gon’ learn is to stop causing trouble.
C: JIMMY
D: We don’t want no trouble. Just let us by. We‘ont want no parts a no union no how.
C: WHITE MAN
D: Don’t look that way to me.
C: SAP MAN
D: Me neither, Ned.
E: O.C.
N: Arthur and Jimmy turn. Another white man, SAP MAN, has approached from behind. He wields a BUCHEIMER BLACKJACK SAP. A look passes between Jimmy and Arthur. Jimmy undrapes Arthur’s arm from his shoulders and leaves him to stand on his own. He raises his hands plaintively.
C: JIMMY
D: Look. We can work this...
N: Whatever Jimmy’s got to say bears no interest to White Man. He SWINGS his Crow Bar HARD. Jimmy barely dodges the blow. Arthur musters all his strength and leaps toward Sap Man who swings the sap and connects. But Arthur is able to absorb the blow with his heavy shoulders. Sap Man is surprised by his strength. They struggle over the sap. Jimmy dodges another blow. White Man swings wildly again. This time Jimmy lets the bar come dangerously close and then steps past the arc of the White Man’s follow through. He surprises White Man with a quick JAB to the face. And another set of rapid fire blows. The man drops his weapon as Jimmy continues to back him up. The sap goes flying. Arthur and Sap Man fall to the ground. Arthur maneuvers to get on top of him where his weight will give him the advantage. But Sap Man has another idea. He reaches for the SMITH & WESSON MODEL 10 REVOLVER tucked in his waist band. Arthur’s eyes go WIDE. He grabs for the gun. Jimmy PUNCHES White Man with ALL HIS MIGHT. He FALLS to the ground unconscious. Just as Jimmy turns to help Arthur... BANG!!! BANG!!! Sap Man pushes a BLOODIED, GUT SHOT Arthur off of him and FIRES at Jimmy. TREE BARK explodes just behind Jimmy’s head as he DIVES out of the way. Sap Man scrambles to his feet FIRING ANOTHER SHOT at Jimmy who scurries out of sight - grabbing the crow bar as he goes.
S: EXT. WOODS/A FEW FEET AWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Jimmy takes refuge behind a BIG TREE. He braces himself; ready to swing. Eyes whipping everywhere. Straining to hear. MOMENTS LATER A BOOT hesitates over a TWIG. Then sets down silently just to it’s side. Sap Man approaches as stealthily as he can. Gun cocked and ready. Up ahead - at the base of the Big Tree, he sees just the TIP of JIMMY’S SHOE. He approaches in silence and then whips around the trunk BLASTING into...air. He looks down at two EMPTY SHOES. And looks up just in time to see the CROW BAR as it careens toward his... THWOCCCK - the unmistakable sound of metal fracturing skull. Jimmy, SOCKS ONLY adorning his feet, stands over the fallen man. He swings the bar twice more to be sure. Then drops the blood stained instrument. Picks up the gun. And his shoes.
S: EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER
N: Arthur is BLEEDING OUT in the spot where Sap Man left him. Jimmy crouches next to him. Rocks him awake. He stirs. Weak.
C: JIMMY
D: C’mon, Arthur. You gots to get up now.
C: ARTHUR
D: You was right, Jimmy.
C: JIMMY
D: Fuck you talkin’ bout? Get up.
C: ARTHUR
D: You’ve seen this before. You know.
C: JIMMY
D: I seen people survive worse.
C: ARTHUR
D: Good. Then let’s git to Chicago. Right now.
C: JIMMY
D: Alright. C’mon.
N: Jimmy tries pulling him up again. But he just slumps in his arms. Dead with his eyes open. Jimmy realizes. Takes his moment. Closes his friend’s eyes. MOMENTS LATER Jimmy’s SOCK CLAD FOOT kicks White Man until he stirs. Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 8. He opens his eyes. He sees Jimmy standing over him holding Sap Man’s gun at his side. White Man looks around and sees the slumped corpse of Sap Man. He starts scooting backward on his hind parts.
C: WHITE MAN
D: Now, now, look. Let’s not do nothin’ hasty. We can work this out.
C: JIMMY
D: Yes we can. You know my face?
C: WHITE MAN
D: No, suh. No, suh. Never seen ya.
C: JIMMY
D: Yes you have. So you might as well know my name...
N: Jimmy raises the gun. Points it right at the man’s head.
C: WHITE MAN
D: No, suh! PLEASE!!!
C: JIMMY
D: When they ask who sent ya, tell ‘em it was Jimmy Tillman.
C: WHITE MAN
D: NOOOOOOO.....
N: He SQUEEZES the TRIGGER.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. COPELAND’S - NIGHT
N: TITLE: Chicago, Illinois We’re on a BUSTLING AVENUE we will come to know as THE * STROLL. The sidewalk is teeming with storefronts of * BOUTIQUES, SHOPS and RESTAURANTS. Cars are crushed together. * Folks dresses in their SUNDAY BEST are out on the town. * A large MARQUIS fixated above the roof of a fancy restaurant bears the name “Copeland’s.” We drift past the sign into... Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 9.
S: INT. BACK ALLEY / CHICAGO - NIGHT *
N: ...an alley. Narrow. Dark. Empty except for BILLY (mid 20s), bluster masking fear, who stands with TWO BURLY DUDES. He tries and fails to light a CIGARETTE.
C: BILLY
D: I don’t see what the big deal is. I’m saving them...
N: He cuts himself short as a BACK DOOR opens. LIGHT spills into the alley as TWO SILHOUETTED FIGURES emerge. The first, EVERETT COPELAND (mid 30s), an impeccably and conservatively dressed businessman who prides himself on being reasoned, pragmatic, smarter than the next guy, steps uncomfortably close to the scared young man.
C: EVERETT
D: This Billy?
C: BURLY DUDE
D: Unfortunately for him.
C: EVERETT
D: You know who I am?
C: BILLY
D: Yes, suh.
C: EVERETT
D: You know who he is.
N: Billy looks over Everett’s shoulder at JESSE (30), Everett’s younger brother. He’s good looking, but his nose has clearly been BROKEN a number of times. His suit fits, but not just so like his brother. He stares at Billy - a promise of violence. Billy swallows his words. Nods instead.
C: EVERETT
D: We understand you fixed some numbers.
E: CONT’D
N: Billy mumbles something unintelligible. Jesse starts * UNBUTTONING his jacket. *
C: EVERETT
D: I’d start talkin’ if I was you. *
E: CONT’D
C: BILLY *
D: I was trying to save you...save you * some money, suh. *
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 10.
C: EVERETT
D: You damage our rep, you cost us money. You understand that?
C: BILLY
D: Yes, suh.
N: Everett slides a WAD OF CASH out of his pocket and into Billy’s shirt pocket.
C: EVERETT
D: Go make it right. The number hits. * You pay. Got it?
C: BILLY
D: Yes, suh.
C: EVERETT
D: Now.
N: Billy takes off full speed down the alley. Everett and Jesse head back inside...
S: INT. COPELAND’S - CONTINUOUS
N: ...the elegant, high-end restaurant that bares their name. Everett speaks to the MAITRE’D who holds the door open.
C: EVERETT
D: No more interruptions, please.
C: MAITRE’D
D: So sorry, Mr. Copeland.
N: As they move away from him, toward a private dining room... *
C: JESSE *
D: You shoulda let me handle that. *
C: EVERETT *
D: He’s got no broken bones, little * brother. And he won’t do it again. *
C: JESSE *
D: Yeah, but somebody else might. *
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 11.
S: INT. COPELAND’S / PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT *
N: A small intimate dinner in a room designed for royalty. * EZEKIEL “ZEKE” COPELAND (28), playboy, hedonist, the youngest * and most irresponsible of the Copeland Brothers, launches a CHAMPAGNE CORK across the room.
C: ZEKE
D: To my baby sister!
C: ELOISE
D: That’s enough, Ezekiel. *
N: The family matriarch, “LADY” ELOISE COPELAND(late 50s), a wise, traditional woman who is always in-charge, secretly or not, gently reprimands her son. Next to her, the baby, LISA “LILI” COPELAND (25) intelligent eyes, earnest and at the moment quiet.
C: ZEKE
D: But you haven’t even had any. C’mon, Ma. It’s for her big day.
C: ELOISE
D: No thank you.
C: ZEKE
D: Pop ain’t here.
C: ELOISE
D: Boy.
N: He puts down the glass he poured and sits chastened.
C: ELOISE
D: Instead of trying to turn this little dinner into a party all a * sudden, you need to explain to me why y’all throwing a big event tomorrow and the guest of honor is not my LiLi.
E: CONT’D
C: LISA
D: Ma. This is plenty. I don’t need...
C: ELOISE
D: Hush. You’re too modest. She should have the celebration you’re planning tomorrow.
E: to Lisa to Zeke
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 12.
C: ZEKE
D: You don’t understand, Ma. That’s different. If Joe wins this fight - he’s on his way.
C: ELOISE
D: To what? A lifetime of getting beat about the head by other men standing around in their underwear?
C: ZEKE
D: It’s not like that.
C: ELOISE
D: It’s not?
N: An ATTENDANT opens the door as Everett and Jesse enter. *
C: ZEKE *
D: * She wants us to cancel the party.
E: to Everett and Jesse
C: ELOISE
D: No. I want you to do something for your family instead of some boxer you barely know.
C: ZEKE
D: It is for the family.
C: ELOISE
D: How?
C: EVERETT
D: We stand to make a lot of money.
C: JESSE
D: And it’s good for the race. *
C: ELOISE
D: You all do plenty for the race already. Half the Negroes that got jobs in this city work for you.
C: JESSE
D: People need a champ, Ma. Gives ‘em hope.
C: EVERETT
D: Why don’t we do both? Celebrate Joe’s victory. And Lisa’s 1st day at work. Could be like a debutante’s ball...
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 13.
C: ELOISE LISA *
D: I like that. I’m nobody’s debutante. *
C: EVERETT
D: We’d still get to promote our contender. Lisa gets to meet some of the more eligible prospects in town. Hell, maybe Joe takes a shine to her.
C: LISA
D: I’m not interested in no damn boxer.
C: ELOISE
D: Watch your mouth, young lady.
C: JESSE
D: Lisa - do you want a party?
C: LISA
D: No. I keep trying to say that.
C: JESSE
D: Ma. She don’t want it. Don’t make * her.
C: ELOISE
D: Then cancel it.
C: ZEKE JESSE *
D: Toldja. Ma! *
C: EVERETT
D: We’ve already invited half the town. Hazel and Esther are at the club setting things up right now.
C: JESSE *
D: Please, Ma. *
C: LISA *
D: Let ‘em have their party. *
N: Eloise sits unmoved. Zeke throws back some champagne. A sudden, quiet KNOCK on the door breaks the tension.
C: JESSE
D: What!?
N: The Maitre’D enters tentatively. He is dragging a PHONE with a LONG CHORD with him. Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 14.
C: MAITRE’D
D: I’m sorry, Mr. Copeland. It’s Mr. Roxborough. He insisted.
N: Everett takes the phone.
C: EVERETT
D: What now?
E: into phone
S: INT. ROXY’S GYM / RING - MORNING
N: WHAAAAAM!!!! SWEAT DROPLETS leap off a MAN’S FACE as a LEATHER BOXING MITT SMASHES into it. The Man stumbles backwards. He manages to get his MITTS up in a defensive position as his opponent, JOE LOUIS BARROW (18), skinny but ripped, maybe angry, stalks toward him and unleashes a fusillade of punishing blows. The two are in a ring in the middle of a modest, well-kept boxing gym. FOUR OBSERVERS, obscured by shadow, watch from the upstairs office window.
S: INT. ROXY’S GYM / OFFICE - CONTINUOUS *
N: The office is dark, smoky. Thick tension sits on the room. Everett and Jesse talk with fellow Policy Kings, LUCKY SMITH (45) and JOHN “ROXY” ROXBOROUGH (40), Joe’s manager.
C: JESSE
D: What’s the big deal? Didn’t this bastard already agree to the fight.
C: ROXY
D: He did. But now he’s getting cold feet. Says if his man loses to a colored, it could ruin him.
C: JESSE
D: Fuck ‘em both. Shouldn’t be no fighter if he’s scary.
C: EVERETT
D: But he’s not scary is he?
C: ROXY
D: I don’t think so. Started talkin’ ‘white boy.’ Said the terms don’t reflect his client’s exposure.
C: LUCKY
D: How much we talkin’?
C: EVERETT
D: Didn’t say a number did he?
C: ROXY
D: Nope.
C: EVERETT
D: Of course. Let us figure out how much the fight is worth to us.
C: JESSE
D: Wait a second. We already agreed to give him the gate and half the purse. Even if we win. You not actually thinking about paying this cocksucker more are you?
C: EVERETT
D: I’m not thinking of doing shit.
C: JESSE
D: You just gon’ let the fight go?
C: EVERETT
D: Jesse....
C: JESSE
D: What!?
C: EVERETT
D: Get a hold of yourself, little brother.
C: JESSE
D: Tired of these fuckin’ crackas.
C: EVERETT
D: You finished?
N: Beat.
C: EVERETT
D: We’ll be there. They can show up if they want. Or they can forfeit.
E: CONT’D
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 16. Jesse’s not finished. He storms out of the office. Slamming the door behind him. Everett watches after him a beat.
C: EVERETT
D: Sorry, Roxy.
E: CONT’D
C: ROXY
D: He’s right. Forfeiture ain’t a K.O.
C: EVERETT
D: It’s a bluff.
C: ROXY
D: I dunno. Might want to set a precedent. Sides - he don’t need the fight. We do.
C: LUCKY *
D: No we don’t. We make our bread off * the numbers. This just gravy. *
C: ROXY *
D: This is legal. *
C: EVERETT
D: Can’t we fight somebody else?
C: ROXY
D: Not tonight. Dewey Sanders has to be his next fight. Joe beat him, we on our way.
C: LUCKY
D: Where? And how much more money it * gon’ take to get there? *
C: ROXY
D: When he gets his weight up, I believe we might be looking at the next Jack Johnson.
C: LUCKY
D: They ain’t never gonna be no ‘nother Jack Johnson.
C: ROXY
D: But what if there is? Can you imagine what it would mean?
C: LUCKY
D: I know. That’s why we done what we did already. But I can’t see it. Here, there.
E: MORE
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 17.
C: LUCKY
D: Somewhere along the way - they gon’ make sure the nigga don’t win.
E: CONT'D
C: EVERETT
D: Tell him the terms is the terms. * We’ll see him tonight. Or we won’t.
E: to Roxy
N: Roxy exits.
C: LUCKY
D: Jesse’s in a state. You shoulda brought Zeke along to calm his ass down.
C: EVERETT
D: He’s supposed to be here.
C: LUCKY
D: So where is he?
N: On Everett, asking the same question. OMITTED OMITTED
S: INT. ZEKE’S CRASH PAD / LIVING ROOM - DAY *
N: An UPSCALE BACHELOR’S PAD. There are framed photos everywhere * of Zeke with his arm draped around or lifting glasses with * luminaries of the day like ROBERT ABBOTT, LOUIS ARMSTRONG, * WALTER BARNES, JELLY ROLL MORTON, WILLIAM EDOUARD SCOTT, an * assortment of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN including a not yet famous * KATHERINE DUNHAM and POLICY KINGS like POLICY SAM, MUSHMOUTH * JOHNSON and THE JONES BROTHERS. The COUCH is the finest * leather. The TABLE, BAR - SOLID MACASSAR EBONY. All the * LIQUOR - TOP SHELF. The latest and most expensive PHONOGRAPH * PLAYER AND RADIO and several ROLLEIFLEX CAMERAS adding a * distinct panache to the place. * A man and WOMAN’S CLOTHES are DISCARDED haphazardly across * the floor from the front door to the couch. The Woman (20s) * voluptuous, uninhibited, is bent over said couch screaming in delight as Zeke fucks her from behind.
C: WOMAN
D: Oh Zeke! Right there, baby! Right there! OH GOD, OH GOD...
E: O.S.
N: It sounds like they’re close to finishing. Unfortunately... Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 18. CRAAAAASH - the DOOR JAM splinters as A LARGE MAN KICKS in the FRONT DOOR.
C: WOMAN
D: Oh GOD!
E: CONT’D terrified
N: The Woman attempts to cover herself with her arms as Zeke spins and instinctively tries to pull his PANTS up from around his ankles.
C: LARGE MAN
D: Not so fast.
N: He levels a REMINGTON .45 CALIBER M1911 at Zeke who slowly stands back up - hands raised in the air - careful to place his body between the Woman and the gun. FRANK “BETTER OFFER” BARNES, (40s) a stylish gentleman with a * cold heart, steps into the apartment.
C: BETTER OFFER
D: Let him grab his pants. This one don’t pack.
C: LARGE MAN
D: You sure, boss?

E: feigning surprise
N: The Woman cuts Zeke a look. He shrugs.
C: BETTER OFFER
D: She can go.
E: CONT’D
C: ZEKE
D: We’ll try this again real soon, baby.
N: The Woman quickly slides past Zeke, covering her nakedness as best she can as she grabs a few of her garments off the floor and scurries out the door. Better Offer tips his hat and closes the door behind her while Zeke buttons his pants. Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 19.
C: BETTER OFFER
D: Fine woman.
C: ZEKE
D: I thought so too. There a reason you ain’t let us finish?
C: BETTER OFFER
D: I want my money.

D: It’s hard to say.
C: BETTER OFFER
D: I can say. You’d rather your wife know you’re a cooze hound than your brothers know you are such a fucking degenerate that even after they forbade you gamble ever again, you’re still laying jacks with me.

N: Better Offer just shakes his head.
C: BETTER OFFER
D: You better. Or I will take it up with your brothers.
N: He leaves. On Zeke, looking stressed for the first time.
S: EXT. WASHINGTON PARK NEIGHBORHOOD / COPELAND MANSION - DAY
N: A crisp, autumn day. * Nestled on the historic, well-manicured 5900 block of South * Park Avenue, the Copeland Mansion sits kitty corner to the former home of Chicago’s 1st Black banker, Jesse Binga. Eloise calls to the WHITE DRIVER waxing the CADILLAC.
C: ELOISE
D: Make sure it sparkles. I want everything perfect for my baby’s first day.
C: WHITE DRIVER
D: Yes, Ma’am.
N: She heads into...
S: INT. COPELAND MANSION / FOYER - CONTINUOUS *
N: ...the massive foyer and heads up the stairwell. Her hand holds a beautiful HAND-CARVED BANNISTER as she ascends. Art by prominent and yet-known Negro artists of the day hangs on the walls. Among them are pieces by HENRY OSSAWA TANNER, ARCHIBALD MOTLEY, WILLIAM H. JOHNSON and early works by CHARLES WHITE. In the center of them all is an OIL PORTRAIT of a YOUNGER ELOISE with her late husband, ROYAL COPELAND, a handsome, if not stern, officious looking man. Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 21. They are surrounded by Everett, Jesse, Zeke and Lisa when * they were much younger. In the painting, Lisa looks to be * about 8 years old. *
S: INT. COPELAND MANSION / UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Eloise pushes down the long hallway adorned with more Black art. She passes “Girl in a Green Dress” by William H. Johnson before she opens a door without knocking and enters...
S: INT. COPELAND MANSION / LISA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: ...interrupting Lisa who is trying to mask her nerves in chiffon. She stands in front of an elegant FULL LENGTH MIRROR staring at the FLORAL PRINT DRESS she’s wearing. It is modest and professional. Just slightly more daring than the GREEN DRESS she’s holding up to consider. *
C: LISA
D: Mom...
C: ELOISE
D: You ain’t got nothin’ I ain’t seen and nothin’ I ain’t make.
C: LISA
D: You never fail to remind me.
C: ELOISE
D: Look at my little LiLi Swan. College graduate. First day working at Chicago United Savings and Loan.
C: LISA
D: It’s not a big deal, Mom.
C: ELOISE
D: It is to me. And it would be to your father if he was still here. Thank God you didn’t drop out of school like Everett. Or get kicked out like Jesse.
C: LISA
D: They’re men. They have the luxury of...
C: ELOISE
D: They’re Negro men. They don’t have any luxuries.
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 22.
C: LISA
D: You know what I’m saying.
C: ELOISE
D: I do. That’s why I want you to make a good impression. Be courteous, polite. Don’t talk unless he asks you something directly. And when you do - soften your voice. You want to speak loud enough for Mr. Randolph to hear you without straining. But that’s it.
C: LISA
D: Be seen and not heard.
C: ELOISE
D: Exactly.
C: LISA
D: That is not why I took this job, Mom. And that’s not why Mr. Randolph hired me.
C: ELOISE
D: Mr. Randolph hired you because he was your father’s oldest friend. And if you’ve got half the sense I think you have, you’ll look at this job as an opportunity to listen and to earn his trust.
C: LISA
D: And when do I talk?
C: ELOISE
D: No time soon if you want to learn anything.
N: She starts out the room, but pauses at the door.
C: ELOISE
D: The flowers look good on you.
E: CONT’D
N: On Lisa, annoyed at every bit of her mother’s counsel.
S: INT. COPELAND MANSION / KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Like the rest of the house, the kitchen is extremely well * appointed. The most MODERN FIXTURES embedded in the classic * architecture. * Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 23. Jesse is in the kitchen stuffing BILLS into a DISLODGED WOOD PANEL along the base of the cabinet. He looks grim. Eloise walks in and surprises him.
C: ELOISE
D: Boy, I told you I’m not gonna use any of that money.
C: JESSE
D: It’s here if you need it.
C: ELOISE
D: Your father took care of me. You don’t have to.
C: JESSE
D: Nonetheless.
N: He replaces the wood and stands up.
C: ELOISE
D: What’s wrong?
C: JESSE
D: Nothin’, Ma. Gotta run.
N: He bolts the kitchen. Eloise picks up the PHONE and dials.
C: ELOISE
D: Morning. Everett and Jesse are at * it again. *
S: INT. TRAIN / BOX CAR - DAY
N: Cargo packed in stacks of WOODEN CRATES jostle rhythmically in the dark, crowded box car. Jimmy Tillman sits amongst them. He looks as if he has not slept. He wears the same clothes from the ruined meeting several nights before. He’s face is streaked with TEARS. He wipes his face. Approaches the sliver of DAYLIGHT slipping through the CRACK in the BOX CAR DOORS. Cautiously, he peers through the opening.
C: JIMMY
D: Damn. Arthur.
E: sotto
S: EXT. ILLINOIS CENTRAL TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS *
N: This is not Arkansas. The station itself is HUGE. An ENORMOUS MASS OF PEOPLE crowd around the tracks awaiting the oncoming TRAIN. More, it seems than the entire population of Arkansas. There are COLORED, WHITE, ASIAN and HISPANIC PEOPLE - each group circled in an enclave of its own. Many await loved ones. Or have tickets and baggage of their own and plan to board the train for its next destination. Then there are the PEDDLERS, VALETS, CABBIES, PORTERS, POLICY WRITERS and OTHER HUSTLERS who have all descended on this crush of humanity in hopes of making their daily bread. PAPER BOYS loudly hawk their respective NEWSPAPERS: the Chicago Tribune, Chicago American, Chicago Daily Times. The group of BLACK PAPER BOYS that sell THE CHICAGO DEFENDER, no doubt aware that their paper is in the middle of a very intentional campaign to draw Southern Blacks to Chicago, are among the loudest of them all.
C: BLACK PAPER BOY
D: Get The Defender! Your Guide to the Promised Land!
C: BLACK PAPER BOY 2
D: Defender! Get your Defender!
N: There’s also the BULLS, a group of white men wielding BILLY CLUBS who have a particular interest in the cargo cars of the train. One of which has scrawled on its side: “Farewell - We’re Good and Gone. Bound for the Promised Land.” The train BELCHES SMOKE as it grinds to a halt and announces itself with a LOUD WHISTLE. The Bulls start moving toward the various cargo cars.
S: INT. TRAIN / BOX CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Jimmy spies the Bulls fanning out. A couple approach his car.
C: JIMMY
D: Shit.
N: He retreats back into the shadows.
S: INT/EXT. TRAIN / BOX CAR - MOMENTS LATER
N: The Bulls throw the doors to Jimmy’s car open. Even fully illuminated by daylight, Jimmy is nowhere in sight.
C: BULL 1
D: I’ll check it.
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 25. BULL 1 jumps inside and starts walking through the stacks, looking around, indiscriminately tapping the crates with his BILLY CLUB to see if they sound odd. He is approaching a PARTICULAR CRATE towards the far end of the car when he hears...
C: RANDOM BULL
D: Hey! You! Git back here!
E: O.S.
N: Bull 1 immediately turns and jumps off the car. He and Bull 2 join the others in running after a STOWAWAY.
S: INT. TRAIN / BOX CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: The LID pops off of that particular crate. From inside, Jimmy quickly lowers the lid to the floor and climbs out.
S: EXT. TRAIN / BOX CAR - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jimmy sticks his head out the box car door. He sees the crowd dispersing as the Stowaway tries to run away. But the Bulls catch him and proceed to BEAT HIM MERCILESSLY. While almost everyone’s distracted, Jimmy slips off the train and quickly approaches the crowd. One man, CASPER(30), a dandy sporting a GOLD POCKET WATCH and a matching GOLD TOOTH, clocks him while he talks to a female POLICY CUSTOMER. *
C: POLICY CUSTOMER *
D: ...I ain’t no Copeland. Just have to be a day number today.
C: CASPER
D: And hopefully a gig tomorrow. Before you know it, you’ll be havin’ ‘em over for dinner.
E: with a wink
N: She laughs as she digs for change. For Jimmy, it’s easy to get lost in a crowd this size. He notices TICKETED BLACK PASSENGERS disembarking the train in droves. There are joyous and tearful reunions all over the platform. Jimmy tucks his head and continues moving briskly toward the exit hoping to go unnoticed. He walks by CASPER who is finishing the exchange of a POLICY SLIP for a NICKEL with the * female customer. Casper excuses himself and follows after * Jimmy.
C: CASPER
D: Man with your luck don’t need to rush.
E: CONT’D
N: Jimmy ignores him. Casper falls in step.
C: CASPER
D: You must look like your Mama.
E: CONT’D
C: JIMMY
D: What? The fuck you just say?
C: CASPER
D: Don’t mean no offense, Country. Just observing that you was born for luck.
C: JIMMY
D: How you figure?
C: CASPER
D: How you not? You saw what happened to your fellow striver.
C: JIMMY
D: I don’t know what you talkin’ bout.
C: CASPER
D: I ain’t the law, man. Just tryna put a little money in your pocket?
C: JIMMY
D: You gonna put money in my pocket?
C: CASPER
D: After you put some in mine. A nickel gets you five dollars. Five’ll get you plenty. Just tell me your 3 favorite numbers and we be on our way.
C: JIMMY
D: I ain’t the gambling type.
C: CASPER
D: You sure? The squares usually buy tickets when they ride the train.
C: JIMMY
D: Get away from me, man. I don’t know you.
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 27.
C: CASPER
D: I reckon you don’t know nobody. But everybody needs a friend in Chicago.
C: JIMMY
D: Do I look like I got money?
C: CASPER
D: You look like you got a good head on your shoulders. Good enough to bet on yourself. And good enough to bet on the right candidate when the time comes.
C: JIMMY
D: Now you want me to vote? I just got here.
C: CASPER
D: We’ll get you set up. Just make sure you remember who your friends are when it’s election time.
C: JIMMY
D: You can help me find a place? Cheap?
C: CASPER
D: Cheap is my specialty. I know the perfect spot. Come with me.
N: Jimmy hesitates. Casper offers his megawatt smile. The glint from the sun bouncing off his gold tooth is almost blinding.
C: JIMMY
D: Fuck it.
E: sotto
N: They start walking.
C: JIMMY
D: Name’s not Country. It’s Jimmy.
E: CONT’D
C: CASPER
D: Please to meet you, Jimmy. Casper.
C: JIMMY
D: They really let Negroes vote up * here?
C: CASPER
D: Let us? Shiiit. These crackas need us.
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 28.
S: EXT. CHICAGO UNITED SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY
N: A beehive of patrons swarms in and out of Bronzeville’s own * DEPARTMENT STORE. Across State Street, nestled on the corner * in the shadow of the Bates Building sits Chicago United. A * large HAND PAINTED SIGN on the open brick wall of the adjacent building says “INVEST IN YOUR OWN AT CHICAGO UNITED * SAVINGS & LOAN.” *
S: INT. CHICAGO UNITED SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY *
N: Sunlight streams through LARGE, ARCHED WINDOWS bathing the * bank’s mid-day rush in warm light. Every teller, manager and * customer is Colored. Towards the back of the main floor, Lisa, now wearing the GREEN DRESS, sits at a desk strategically positioned in front of a CLOSED OFFICE DOOR with the words “MANAGER” stenciled across the frosted glass. She is talking to an older customer, MR. FERGUSON (60s) feeble and distraught. He leans unsteadily on a CANE.
C: LISA
D: Mr. Randolph will see you as soon as he can, sir. If you’ll just take a seat...
C: MR. FERGUSON
D: Please, Miss. Our little house is alls we got. I told my fool wife not to pay no never-mind to no damn dream book, but she run off and done it anyhow. Now we ain’t got the mortgage again. I’s just hoping Mr. Randolph could find it in his heart to give us a little relief.
N: Lisa stands and starts steering him over to the waiting area.
C: LISA
D: I’m so sorry to hear that, Mr. Ferguson. I’m sure Mr. Randolph will do everything he can to help you. Now if you don’t mind taking a seat right over here, I will make certain that you are his very next customer.
C: MR. FERGUSON
D: You sho’ is sweet, Miss. Thank... Oh shit.
E: suddenly excited
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 29. Lisa turns. Sees what he sees. Her older brother, Everett, striding into the bank as if he owns it. Some customers point him out; others tip their hats. A few pretend not to see him, but what’s clear is that everybody notices as he passes.
C: MR. FERGUSON
D: Pardon me, Miss. Not every day you see one of the Copeland Brothers. * The head brother at that. *
E: CONT’D
C: LISA
D: Excuse me please.
N: Moving as quickly and casually as she can, Lisa returns to her post and sits just before Everett arrives.
C: EVERETT
D: How’s the first day on the big job?
C: LISA
D: What do you want, Everett?
C: EVERETT
D: I need to talk to your boss.
C: LISA
D: You’ll have to come back. He’s in a meeting right now.
C: EVERETT
D: Tell him it’s me.
C: LISA
D: It doesn’t matter. They’re customers waiting. One in particular who lost his mortgage payment playing policy.
C: EVERETT
D: And you think that’s my fault.
C: LISA
D: Our fortune is built on the backs * of the less fortunate.
C: EVERETT
D: You sound like Dad. *
C: LISA
D: Daddy was right. *
C: EVERETT
D: I don’t have time, Lili. He called me.
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 30.
C: LISA
D: Have a seat. I’ll let Mr. Randolph know you’re here.
C: EVERETT
D: Lisa...
C: LISA
D: You’re gonna wait. Like everybody else for a change.
C: EVERETT
D: And you will lose your little job if I do.
C: LISA
D: Are you going to be the one that tells Mom you got me fired on my first day?
C: EVERETT
D: Jesus Christ. Here.
N: Everett abruptly counts out SEVERAL BILLS onto her desk.
C: LISA
D: What’s this for?
C: EVERETT
D: The old man. Now tell Mr. Randolph I’m here.
N: Lisa smiles wryly as she stands. Raps quietly on the door.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Come in, Lisa.
E: O.S.
N: Just before she cracks the door, Everett offers...
C: EVERETT
D: How sweet. You look just like the girl in Mom’s favorite painting.
N: On Lisa, wry smile erased. Now more annoyed than ever.
C: LISA
D: Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Randolph...
S: INT. CHICAGO UNITED SAVINGS & LOAN / OFFICE - LATER *
N: The office is decorated with more taste and capital than one would expect in a bank manager’s office. Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 31. Everett and CURTIS “EYEBALL” RANDOLPH (50s), regal, a * gangster turned statesman dressed in an exquisite IMPORTED * ITALIAN SUIT, talk in hushed tones. It’s clear, he’s more * than just a bank manager. *
C: RANDOLPH
D: You been having trouble with any of your wheels?
C: EVERETT
D: Some idiot who tried to change the * numbers after the pull. I straightened him out.
C: RANDOLPH
D: No raids?
N: Everett raps the desk.
C: EVERETT
D: None yet. But not sure how long our protection lasts with the new * administration in place. *
C: RANDOLPH
D: I know. I’m working on it.
C: EVERETT
D: That’s why you called me down here? You wanna talk about Cermak again?
C: RANDOLPH
D: Actually - I heard you and Jesse are having problems.
C: EVERETT
D: Who told you? Roxy? Lucky? *
C: RANDOLPH
D: Doesn’t matter. What’s going on?
C: EVERETT
D: Sanders’ manager wants more money for the fight. Jesse wants to handle it.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Well you don’t want that.
C: EVERETT
D: Exactly.
C: RANDOLPH
D: So, he’s mad you’re paying him.
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 32.
C: EVERETT
D: I’m not paying him.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Why not?
C: EVERETT
D: Cuz fuck these crackas.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Now you sound like Jesse.
C: EVERETT
D: He’s not all wrong. Hell I agree with him - a Colored Heavyweight Champ will do wonders for the race. And our balance sheets.
C: RANDOLPH
D: So then pay. The more legitimate businesses we have the better. Plus- you don’t want your brother upsetting the balance of things. We got enough trouble with Cermak in office as it is.
C: EVERETT
D: Fine. About Cermak...?
N: Randolph moves to the wall. Flips back a painting, “The Good * Shepherd” by Tanner. Behind it, a HIDDEN SAFE. He starts * removing CASH.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Yes.
C: EVERETT
D: All due respect - I just don’t see * it.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Why not?
C: EVERETT
D: Did the Democrats free the slaves?
C: RANDOLPH
D: No. And neither did Big Bill Thompson.
C: EVERETT
D: He did a lot more for us than that Czech bastard ever will.
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 33.
C: RANDOLPH
D: That Czech bastard won. He’s the Mayor now.
C: EVERETT
D: So we’re just supposed to fall in line. Throw out 65 years of party loyalty because we lost one election.
C: RANDOLPH
D: We’re not loyal to a party. We’re loyal to our interests.
C: EVERETT
D: And Anton Cermak is serving our interest? Raiding wheels and arresting every other writer we know.
C: RANDOLPH
D: He wants us to fall in line. He * knows the Republican machine is gonna pull out all the stops to take City Hall back. He won’t win * again without us. *
C: EVERETT *
D: Not gonna get our vote with the * shit he’s doing now. *
C: RANDOLPH *
D: It’s the only way he knows to deal * with Negroes. *
C: EVERETT
D: So we should teach him a lesson and * vote his ass outta office. Before * he destroys the policy business. *
C: RANDOLPH
D: Three long years till we elect a * new mayor. But if we get on his * side now, we can control him. *
C: EVERETT
D: How we gon’ do that?
N: Randolph hands him a FEW BRICKS OF CASH.
C: RANDOLPH
D: I’m gonna talk to him.
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 34.
C: EVERETT
D: Let me know how that goes. In the mean time, I’ll go pay the man.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Make sure you call Jesse first.
C: EVERETT
D: I’ll take care of it.
E: getting up to leave
C: RANDOLPH
D: Everett.
N: He stops.
C: RANDOLPH
D: You guys are better together than you are apart.
E: CONT’D
N: On Everett, knowing that it’s true. *
S: EXT. LESTER DANIEL’S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
N: The Northside. Most of the commuters are Caucasian. LESTER DANIELS (30s) aka THE MANAGER leaves the office building and approaches an awaiting PACKARD on the curve. A NEGRO DRIVER holds the door open and closes it behind him. I/E. PACKARD - LATER Lester Daniels reads the CHICAGO TRIBUNE as the car cruises along. He notices that the car passes his turn. *
C: LESTER
D: You missed your turn. You’re supposed to turn right on 79th. *
N: The Negro Driver does not respond or look up. It is odd.
C: NEGRO DRIVER *
D: You got another appointment, you’ll be wanting to keep, Mr. Daniels.
N: As he speaks, he raises a REVOLVER so Lester can see it. Then lays it on the seat next to him. On Lester, silent now. And afraid. Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 35.
S: EXT. SOUTHSIDE POLICY BANK - DAY
N: Jimmy and Casper walk through a rough part of the Southside. The block is lined with STORE FRONTS and TENEMENT BUILDINGS in varying stages of disrepair. A RADIO broadcasts Jack L. * Cooper’s “The All Negro Hour” from an OPEN WINDOW. It is all breathtaking to Jimmy - who has not seen a section of a city of this magnitude filled with nothing but Negroes. There are some BUMS here and there, but also many Negroes driving cars and trucks, hustling their wares from the corners. One such brother, a NUMBERS RUNNER, is in the middle of a furtive transaction with an OLD WOMAN. She is handing him some MONEY when a BEAT COP rounds the corner.
C: OLD WOMAN
D: I ain’t know’d whether to play my Myron’s name or Little Darryl. But since Myron ain’t got the rent I...
N: The Numbers Runner drops her CHANGE on the ground and takes off - running away from the Beat Cop who gives chase.
C: JIMMY
D: Y’all got colored cops too?
C: CASPER
D: Not much better than the white ones you ask me. Folks just tryin’ to make their way through the panic and these toms wanna make it harder.
C: JIMMY
D: Jobs all dried up?
C: CASPER
D: Lotta folks outta work since the crash. But there’s still more Negroes working here than anywhere on Earth. *
C: JIMMY
D: That’s not true. *
C: CASPER
D: Sure it is. Cuz there’s more * Negroes on the south side of * Chicago than there is in Africa. *
N: Jimmy laughs. * Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 36.
C: CASPER *
D: Everybody read the same paper brung you here, Jimmy. More people. More * jobs. More opportunity. Let’s cut * through this alley. *
E: CONT’D
N: They turn off the main drag into an alley.
C: JIMMY
D: You know anybody hiring?
C: CASPER
D: Depends on the kinda work you looking for. What you used to do back in...where you say you came from again?
C: JIMMY
D: I didn’t.
C: CASPER
D: That’s alright, Jimmy. Er’body get off that train runnin’ from one thing or another. You good with...
E: chuckling
N: TWO ROUGH MEN brandishing KNIVES step from the SHADOWS.
C: ROUGH MAN
D: Alright, Fancy Man. I’ll take the cash. And your gold watch. You too. Empty your pockets.
C: CASPER
D: You’re making a mistake.
C: ROUGH MAN
D: Shut the fuck up. Hand it over!
N: Jimmy’s hands move toward his waist. Rough Man 2 charges. Jimmy starts to pull the Smith & Wesson, but Casper grabs his hand - stopping him - before he can pull it all the way out.
C: JIMMY
D: What the hell you doin’?
C: CASPER
D: No need for that.
N: Rough Man now has his KNIFE at Jimmy’s throat. *
C: JIMMY
D: You set me up?
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 37.
C: CASPER
D: Not in the slightest. These boys gonna apologize and we gon’ be on our way.
C: ROUGH MAN 2
D: Why the fuck would we do that?
C: CASPER
D: Cuz we work for the Copeland Brothers.
N: He flashes his gilded smile.
C: ROUGH MAN 2
D: Oh shit. Chauncey?
C: ROUGH MAN 1
D: What you saying my name for, man? We sorry. Here. We ‘on’t want no trouble.
E: to Casper
N: He rifles his pockets. Drops a couple of CRUMPLED BILLS.
C: ROUGH MAN 1
D: Give him your money, fool.
E: CONT’D
C: ROUGH MAN 2
D: I ain’t got no money.
E: backing away
C: ROUGH MAN 1
D: Just come on. We sorry. Tell the Misters - we * sorry.
E: to Casper
N: The two men run off.
C: JIMMY
D: The Misters? What the hell? Who are * the Copeland Brothers? *
N: Jimmy starts picking up the money off the ground.
C: CASPER
D: Told you it’s good to have friends in Chicago.
C: JIMMY
D: I ain’t never heard tell of no friends like that.
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 38.
C: CASPER
D: Welcome to Bronzeville. Home of the Copeland Brothers. Far as I know - the owners and operators of more policy wheels than anybody in Chicago.
E: walking ahead
C: JIMMY
D: What’s a wheel?
S: EXT. COPELAND'S HABERDASHERY - DAY *
N: Copeland’s Haberdashery sits in the middle of a bustling block known as Whiskey Row years ago when it was the center of the city’s Red Light District. Now it is a brisk * commercial district filled with Black-owned businesses. *
C: CASPER
D: The wheel’s a bank. Not no Savings and Loan. It’s where they pull the numbers and people find out whether they hit or not. And get their cash. $20 for a dime gig. $200 for jacks if you got the balls.
E: V.O.
N: One PATRON races toward the storefront.
S: INT. COPELAND’S HABERDASHERY - DAY
N: A surprisingly large group of CUSTOMERS are gathered in the * front room of this tailor’s shop in the middle of the afternoon. That is because despite the presence of SEWING MACHINES, MANNEQUINS and WORK COUNTERS that are the tell-tale signs of a tailoring business, most are not gathered to get their trousers hemmed.
C: JIMMY
D: They can front all that?
E: V.O.
C: CASPER
D: Course they can. Folk say they rake in millions off those nickel and dime bets. Plus they own more shops, stores, restaurants than you could shake a stick out. Some are full legit.
E: V.O.
N: A RADIO in the shop is also carrying WSBC’s broadcast of “The All Negro Hour,” but no one’s really listening. Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 39. All eyes are focused on the back corner of the room where the POLICY BANKER, a formidable, stern looking man packing a BARELY CONCEALED GUN, stands watching over the crowd. He calls to a LOOKOUT hanging by the front door.
C: POLICY BANKER
D: The law out there?
N: The Lookout, also STRAPPED, briefly steps outside and looks over the block. He steps back in and gives the ALL CLEAR SIGN to the Policy Banker. He positions himself so he BLOCKS the door. Which he LOCKS. The radio is TURNED OFF. A DRAPE is removed from the back counter revealing a small WOODEN BARREL (aka the “WHEEL”.) A BLIND-FOLDED POLICY WRITER begins spinning the Wheel which has almost 80 small NUMBERED RUBBER CAPSULES inside. He is flanked by the Policy Banker who stands ready to take the capsules from the Writer as he pulls them out. Ponds is also there, positioned near the door to the back office. Like the Policy Banker, he is ARMED. The room is LOUD and ELECTRIC. The Policy Writer stops the spin and begins to draw the first number. The hopeful * Customers, most of whom clutch POLICY SLIPS, alternately call * out the numbers they are hoping for, close their eyes in prayer or make other petitions to Higher Powers for a financial blessing.
C: CASPER
D: Loan money to people to start they own businesses too. They the backbone of this community. So don’t nobody wanna fuck wit’ em. Plus they’ll kill you if you do.
E: V.O.
N: Everything goes silent when the Policy Banker looks over to the back office door as Everett Copeland steps out. Everett calls to the Banker...
C: EVERETT
D: Carry on.
N: ...and the organized noise continues. He speaks to Ponds.
C: EVERETT
D: No sign of this manager?
E: CONT’D
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 40.
C: PONDS
D: Not yet.
S: INT. COPELAND'S HABERDASHERY / EVERETT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: Everett closes the door. Crosses to his desk and picks up the phone. His leg jack hammers the floor as he dials.
C: EVERETT
D: Jesse there?
C: ELOISE
D: Ain’t seen him. Everything okay?
E: O.S.
C: EVERETT
D: Everything’s fine.
C: ELOISE
D: Good. I want y’all to come by for dinner before your little fight.
E: O.S.
C: EVERETT
D: Yes, Ma’am.
N: On Everett, wondering if there’s going to be a fight. OMITTED
S: INT. ABANDONED TENEMENT - DAY
N: This building is beyond fucked. Pools of stagnant water. * Holes in walls. Boarded windows. Rats. Unfinished floors. Not a place anyone wants to hang out. No one that is, except Jesse Copeland. He sits on a couple of STACKED APPLE CRATES - a picture of serenity. A door opens and Negro Driver and another HEAVY muscle Lester Daniels through it. He protests as they force walk him to the middle of the floor to stand in front of Jesse.
C: JESSE
D: Let him go.
N: They do so roughly.
C: LESTER
D: Who the fuck are you supposed to be?
C: JESSE
D: I work with Roxy.
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 41.
C: LESTER
D: Well - you tell his black ass the fight is off. I don’t care if you niggas change your mind about the money.
C: JESSE
D: I thought you might say that. And normally - I’m the type of Negro that would take exception to such language. I tend to just react to things without thinking. That’s what my brother tells me...
C: LESTER
D: I don’t give a fuck you black sonuvabitch. Let me go or...
N: Heavy grabs Lester’s face in his MASSIVE HAND. He squeezes Lester’s cheeks together so his lips purse and he can’t talk. *
C: JESSE
D: I already told you I don’t like that kind of language. ‘Sides - we’re just talking here. Being reasonable. Right? That’s how we solve problems. And I’ve put a lot of thought to this.
N: Jesse starts unbuttoning his shirt as he speaks.
C: JESSE
D: See - I think you got cold feet cuz you don’t think a Negro and a white man can have a fair fight. But that’s not true. See - I’m a Negro. You’re white. And we can have a fair fight. Matter of fact, we gon’ have one - right now.
E: CONT’D
N: He drops his shirt revealing a WHITE TANK TEE, BUILT FRAME. Lester mumbles something unintelligible.
C: JESSE
D: Sure it is. This ain’t just about tonight. Gentlemen.
E: CONT’D to his cronies
N: Heavy and Negro Driver step back as Jesse stalks forward. He moves like he spent some time in the ring himself. Lester turns to run, but Heavy and Negro Driver catch him and push him back towards Jesse.... Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 42.
C: LESTER
D: Wait...
N: ...who throws his FIRST PUNCH. It snaps Lester’s head back and staggers him backwards. Heavy and Negro Driver help him keep his balance. Jesse unleashes a vicious combination on Lester. Blood erupts from his face. He drops to a knee. Jesse stands over him menacing - no longer masking his rage.
C: JESSE
D: Fight me, you cocksucker!
N: Lester raises his hand signaling mercy or something, but Heavy and Negro Driver just stand him to his feet. There is a look of a evil joy in Jesse’s eyes. His lips curl into a smile as he approaches for another assault.
C: BOSKO
D: The city’s colored are out of control as it is.
E: O.S.
S: INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR’S OFFICE - DAY *
N: The 44th Mayor of Chicago, ANTON J. CERMAK (59), a Czech political brawler with no formal education, sits with his Chief of Staff, FEDIR “FREDDY” BOSKO (50s), salty, of Polish and Ukrainian descent, sipping tea and talking.
C: BOSKO
D: Giving a private audience to this so called Negro business-man will only embolden the native element.
C: CERMAK
D: Three of the five wards that went for Thompson are on the Southside. Damn near 40,000 votes.
C: BOSKO
D: And we still won.
C: CERMAK
D: Cuz Bill Thompson is a corrupt sonuvabitch. In three years, the * Northside will have forgotten how * terrible the Republican * administration was. We’re gonna * need the Southside coons if we want * to hold this office.
C: BOSKO
D: If you say so.
C: CERMAK
D: I do. So show the fucker in so we can get this over with.
N: The Chief of Staff rises and opens the door to the outer office where Curtis Randolph sits in the waiting area across from the Mayor’s SECRETARY. He’s been there for a while.
C: SECRETRAY
D: You can head in now, Mr. Randolph.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Thank you, Ma’am.
N: Curtis crosses into the office.
C: BOSKO
D: Sorry to keep you waiting, Curtis.
N: There is a slight tinge in the way Bosko says his name.
C: RANDOLPH
D: No problem, Freddy. Happy to finally have a chance to sit down with our Mayor and offer my congratulations in person.
N: The men shake.
C: CERMAK
D: Well it is my pleasure. So good to finally meet you. I hear wonderful things about the work you’re doing in the community.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Actually, sir - we met briefly when you spoke at Wendell Phillips.
C: CERMAK
D: Ah. That was a great event. I do recall. You seemed to be one of the few civic leaders on the Southside who seemed to think I had a snowball’s chance of victory.
C: RANDOLPH
D: I recognize that the entire city does not have the same political disposition we do.
C: CERMAK
D: Do I take that to mean you are also machine loyalist?
C: RANDOLPH
D: Oh contraire. I say “we” in acknowledgement of my particular constituency. I don’t cast my ballot out of rote. I want to forge alliances with those who have the best interest of my community at heart.
C: CERMAK
D: And I have the best interest of all Chicagoans in mind at all times. So it is good that we speak.
C: RANDOLPH
D: There is a particular issue that has confronted the Southside. I wonder if you can help.
C: CERMAK
D: How can I be of service?
C: RANDOLPH
D: It seems, since your election, there has been an inordinate and, I dare say, unnecessary amount of pressure on certain business interests.
C: CERMAK
D: If you’re referring to my administration’s efforts to root out crime and corruption wherever we find it, I will remind you that I campaigned on a promise to do just that.
C: RANDOLPH
D: To be clear - sporting houses are not my concern. And I applaud any attempts to curtail the violence associated with the Outfit. I speak specifically to certain non-violent efforts of colored entrepreneurs who have taken the onus of making capital investments in our district.
N: Cermak looks puzzled.
C: BOSKO
D: He’s talking about policy.
C: CERMAK I know. I’m just....surprised.
D: Curtis, you are one of the first and only Negros to successfully open and run a bank for coloreds in the entire State. Maybe the country. Why’s a man of your relative stature here pandering for hooligans who prey upon the most vulnerable of your people?
E: to Randolph
C: RANDOLPH
D: Respectfully, the men you call hooligans are the only reason there is any hope in our community. A community, I’ll remind you, that has been historically neglected and marginalized in every possible way.
C: CERMAK
D: Are you that desperate for deposits?
C: RANDOLPH
D: I beg your pardon.
C: CERMAK
D: Let’s cut to the quick, shall we? You want the police to lay off the policy bankers so they can funnel money into your “legitimate” bank. And in exchange, you’ll deliver the Black Belt in the next election.
C: RANDOLPH
D: My interests are not self motivated.
C: CERMAK
D: Well, mine are. You see my interests are the city’s interests.
C: RANDOLPH
D: And mine are in supporting the candidate that supports us.
C: CERMAK
D: So we have an understanding?
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 46.
C: RANDOLPH
D: I understand there’s three years until you run again.
N: On Cermak, flummoxed by a Negro that sees himself as equal.
S: INT. ABANDONED TENEMENT - DAY *
N: Lester Daniel’s face is SWOLLEN and BLOODY. Heavy and Negro Driver hold the barely conscious man up as Jesse continues to beat him. Jesse doesn’t notice the CUTS that have opened on * his hands. *
C: JESSE
D: Say it! Say it, you miserable fuck!
N: Alternately striking him and taunting him to speak.
C: JESSE
D: We gon’ have a fair fight. Say it!
E: CONT’D
C: NEGRO DRIVER
D: Jesse, man, you gon’ kill him.
C: JESSE
D: Not if he smartens up.
N: Lester says something. But he’s so weak, no one can hear it.
C: JESSE
D: What’s that?
E: CONT’D
N: Jesse leans in close so he can hear the man’s whispers. Lester SPITS BLOOD in Jesse’s face. Jesse loses his shit. Beating the man so wildly, Heavy and * Negro Driver are forced to let go of him. They exchange looks as the men crash to the floor and Jesse continues to pummel the poor man. * They grab Jesse and pull him off Lester.
C: HEAVY
D: Stop, Jesse! He not gonna give.
N: They pull their boss a few feet away and try to calm him down as he struggles against them.
C: NEGRO DRIVER
D: Jesse, please!
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 47.
C: JESSE
D: Alright, alright, alright!
N: He relents. They let go. All three shake it off for a beat. Jesse finally seeming to get control of himself. Then - quicker than either of them can react, Jesse snatches the GUN from Negro Driver’s waist and strides back over to Lester. He pulls him up by the HAIR and slams the barrel of the gun to his temple.
C: JESSE
D: You got two seconds, mothafucka! One!
E: CONT’D
C: HEAVY
D: Jesse, DON’T!
C: JESSE
D: Two!
N: He SQUEEZES...
C: EVERETT
D: Go ahead.
E: O.C
N: Jesse looks up. Letting go of the trigger before it discharges. He sees Everett standing in the doorway. His Driver behind him holding a LEATHER SATCHEL.
C: EVERETT
D: Do it. Blow him away. Then what?
E: CONT’D
C: JESSE
D: Then this cracka is dead. And all these white cocksuckas know not to fuck wit us.
C: EVERETT
D: Cuz that’s what’s gonna happen right? No. Let me tell you how this plays out. He’s dead. The fight gets cancelled for sure. A bunch of flatfoots investigate the murder of a white man. On the Southside. In * this building. We all get pinched. * You get the hotsquat. Mama’s heart breaks. Again. Every policy bank in Bronzeville is shut down. No more dough for the legit businesses - so they dry up too. If they don’t just burn ‘em down for good measure. Everything we working toward goes down the drain. And for what?
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 48. Jesse says nothing.
C: EVERETT
D: Cuz you a gotdamn hothead. Cuz you refuse to think. Go head if it’s worth it to you. Let him have it.
E: CONT’D
N: Jesse considers his brother. The white man whose barely open eyes still regard him with contempt. Jesse wrestles with his bloodlust. And drops the gun.
C: EVERETT
D: Take him to the house. Ma wants us to come for dinner. Grab the roscoe. Help him sit up.
E: CONT’D to Negro Driver to Jesse to Heavy
N: Heavy does as told. While Negro Driver walks a chastened Jesse out past his brother. The two glare at each other. Once Jesse is gone, Everett goes and crouches by Lester.
C: EVERETT
D: Find me some ice. *
E: CONT’D
N: Heavy leaves. He pulls his SILK POCKET SQUARE out his jacket and goes to wipe Lester’s face. The man FLINCHES. Turns away.
C: EVERETT
D: I’m not gonna hurt you. Is it okay?
E: CONT’D
N: Lester nods. Everett gently begins to wipe the blood away.
C: EVERETT
D: I’m sorry about my brother. He’s... *
E: CONT’D
C: LESTER *
D: ...a fool. *
N: WHAAAAAM - Everett SMACKS the words right out of his mouth - * HARD. His eyes narrow to a slit. *
C: EVERETT *
D: My brother is my brother. You see * the bag? *
N: Lester nods. * Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 49.
C: EVERETT
D: 2 G’s. For your trouble. So the fight goes on. You okay with that?
E: CONT’D
N: Lester doesn’t respond. He leans into the man. Whispers * something only he and the man can hear. Lester’s face whites. Everett speaks audibly again. Still quiet. Very calmly.
C: EVERETT
D: The fight goes on. You had a bad car accident. We ever hear otherwise, all bets are off. Okay?
E: CONT’D
N: Lester Daniels nods, more afraid than he’s ever been.
S: INT. COPELAND MANSION / DINING ROOM - EVENING *
N: A THICK SALVE is applied with care to the CUTS on Jesse’s hands.
C: JESSE
D: It’s nothing, Ma. Worked the heavy bag too hard.
N: Eloise sits next to him at the dining room table tending to his hand while the ELEGANT FEAST that awaits them gets cold. Still pissed, but trying to hide it, Jesse is careful not to look at Everett who sits across the table also working hard not to look at him. Instead, Everett eyes the CLOCK on the wall. Under the table, his leg shakes like it was in the * office. His wife, ESTHER (26), fastidious about rules and quiet to a fault, places a calming HAND on his THIGH to get him to stop. She reiterates the point with her eyes. Also at the table - Lisa, still dressed from work.
C: ELOISE
D: I think you all done got too excited about this fight. You oughta know better.
C: JESSE
D: It’s fine, Ma.
C: ELOISE
D: No it is not fine. Where’s Ezekiel?
N: A BUTLER brings over a few BANDAGES and places them on the table next to Eloise. He disappears back into the kitchen as Eloise continues to work on Jesse’s damaged hand.
C: EVERETT
D: He’s probably at the club. Making sure everything is perfect for tonight.
C: ELOISE
D: I told him to be here. I figured since I’m lettin’ you all throw your little party...
C: JESSE
D: He’ll be here.
C: ELOISE
D: He’s late.
C: LISA
D: He’s always late, Mom.
C: ELOISE
D: Don’t sass me, girl. How was your first day?
C: LISA
D: With the exception of a couple asinine customers, it was...unremarkable.
C: JESSE
D: Need me to talk to somebody?
C: LISA
D: Nothing I can’t handle.
C: ELOISE
D: How was Mr. Randolph?
C: LISA
D: He was fine. I mostly answered the phone. Nothing too exciting.
C: JESSE
D: We can find something for ya.
C: LISA
D: Oh no. I see too much of you guys as it is. No. I’ll pay my dues at Chicago United. Learn the business so one day I can work at a bank that’s not so complicated.
C: JESSE
D: What’s complicated about holding people’s money?
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 51.
C: EVERETT
D: She thinks giving people something to hope for is exploitative.
C: LISA
D: Policy is not hope.
C: EVERETT
D: That’s where you’re wrong, little * sister. *
C: ELOISE
D: Enough. The important thing right now is that this family is together to celebrate my LiLi getting her * business degree and using it. I am so proud of you. God...I wish your father was here.
E: a little emotional
N: She casts a look toward the EMPTY CHAIR at the head of the table. Jesse places a tender hand on his mother’s back.
C: ELOISE
D: I’m okay, baby.
E: CONT’D
C: ZEKE
D: Where’s the next president of Chicago United Savings and Loan!?
E: O.S.
N: Zeke saunters in holding a BOUQUET. He wraps Lisa in a hug.
C: ZEKE
D: I heard deposits was up 100 large today!
E: CONT’D
C: LISA
D: You a fool, boy.
E: laughing
C: ELOISE
D: Ezekiel Marcellus Copeland. You supposed to be here 30 minutes ago.
N: He breaks the hug with Lisa. Heads over to his mother, cheshire stitched to his face. He presents her the bouquet with a flourish. Jesse rolls his eyes.
C: ZEKE
D: It takes time to hand pick roses.
C: LISA
D: Nothing for the bank’s next president?
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 52. He playfully shushes her, roses still extended to Eloise.
C: JESSE
D: He’s conning you, Ma.
N: She takes them, charmed - despite herself.
C: ELOISE
D: I know. But they’ll look lovely on the table. Where’s Hazel?
C: JESSE
D: Left her to finish at the club. She’ll be this way before long.
C: ELOISE
D: Again? We’ll wait. *
C: EVERETT JESSE *
D: We need to be gettin’ to the Ma. We got a lot riding on arena before... this fight...
C: ELOISE
D: Hush. I insist.
C: LISA
D: Please, Ma. Not on account of me.
C: ELOISE
D: What I say?
N: Silence from all. She stands and heads to the kitchen.
C: ELOISE
D: Everett, come help me find a vase for these flowers.
E: CONT’D
C: ESTHER
D: I’ll help you, Ms. Eloise.
C: EVERETT
D: I got it, babe.
N: As Everett follows his Mom through the door into...
S: INT. COPELAND MANSION / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: ....modern and very well appointed kitchen. She instructs the Butler who is waiting there.
C: ELOISE
D: Renfro, be a dear and run the capon back in the oven for me. Dinner’ll be a little while.
C: BUTLER
D: Yessum.
N: He heads into the dining room as Eloise starts opening cabinets from the BUTLER’S PANTRY looking for the right vase.
C: EVERETT
D: Do we really have to wait for Hazel? I don’t want to be late.
C: ELOISE
D: Neither does Jesse. Looks like that’s the only thing y’all can agree on.
C: EVERETT
D: We didn’t say...
C: ELOISE
D: You think I can’t see, boy? Heavy bag. I don’t believe that foolishness for one minute. You need to work out whatever’s going on between the two of you.
C: EVERETT
D: That’s not fair, Ma. Why’s it on me?
C: ELOISE
D: Because you don’t think with your heart. And I’m not gonna be around to play peacemaker forever.
N: She places the flowers in a vase and splays them out for Everett to admire.
C: ELOISE
D: See. Beautiful.
E: CONT’D
N: On Everett, as Eloise returns to the dining room.
S: INT. RAINBO FRONTON - NIGHT
N: WHAAAAAM!!!! BEADS OF SWEAT leap off a Joe Louis’s FACE as a LEATHER BOXING MITT SMASHES into it. Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 54. The man wearing the mitt, DEWEY SANDERS, (26) white, muscular, several pounds heavier and more experienced than Joe stalks forward. Several BANNERS touting CHICAGO GOLDEN GLOVES are strung up around the space. They’re in Fred Mann’s Rainbo Fronten. The giant SMOKE FILLED ROOM is electric. Negroes and whites alike * cheer the sweet science. *
C: SPECTATOR
D: Kill the black bastard!
C: SPECTATOR 2
D: Who told this monkey he could fight!?
N: The two warriors battle. Everett, Jesse and Zeke, now dressed the dashing peacock, squeeze through the crowd and find their seats awaiting them in the front next to Lucky and Roxy.
C: LUCKY
D: That’s right, Joe!
C: ROXY
D: Finish him! Nice of you guys to show up.
E: to Everett
C: EVERETT
D: How we doing?
N: OMITTED OMITTED OMITTED
S: INT. THE ROYALE - LATER
N: POP! A CHAMPAGNE CORK FLIES. Followed by raucous CHEERS from the Southside’s BEST DRESSED and MOST GLAMOROUS, practically all of whom seem to have gathered at The Royale, the Copeland Brothers’ legendary night club in the heart of The Stroll. It is larger and more * tastefully expensive than anyone could imagine for a club * owned by Negroes in 1932. * Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 55. The Brothers are there, as well as Curtis Randolph, Roxy, Lucky Smith, a number of OTHER POLICY KINGS, their WIVES and * MISTRESSES as well as OTHER LADIES, HUSTLERS, GAMBLERS, ENTREPRENEURS, CRIMINALS, and SQUARES too. As long as they look good and have some dollars to spend - they are among. A band, WALTER BARNES AND HIS CREOLIANS, plays on stage. Zeke Copeland takes the floor, OVERFLOWING CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE in hand. Several WAITERS top off those who are in need.
C: ZEKE
D: If you don’t know him now, you gon’ know him soon. And so will the whole world. Lift your glasses for the next champ - MR. JOE LOUIS!!!
N: Everybody cheers. Roxy nudges Joe who attempts to speak. But the crowd is too loud. Zeke notices and simmers the crowd.
C: ZEKE
D: C’mon, yall. Joe got somethin’ to say.
E: CONT’D
C: JOE
D: I just want to thank Roxy for bringing me out here to compete in the Golden Gloves. And the Copeland Brothers for hosting this celebration. Believing in me.
E: stammering slightly
C: LUCKY
D: A lot of us believe in you, Joe.
C: JOE
D: My thanks to you too, suh. And all the Kings!
N: Those gathered around the bar erupt in spontaneous cheers. NEAR THE FRONT DOORS Jimmy, dressed better than before, but clearly working with a limited budget, walks in with Casper. His eyes saucer at the sight of the place; Negroes looking fabulous and dressed to the 9’s.
C: JIMMY
D: I done died and gone to Negro Heaven.
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 56.
C: CASPER
D: Heaven’s later. When we find you a lady. C’mon, let’s get you a drink.
E: laughing
C: JIMMY *
D: They own this too...? *
N: The two blend into the mass of people, just missing Better Offer as he heads over to Zeke who stands with MRS. HAZEL COPELAND (30.) She is stunning, a star in her own right, named for her eyes. Better Offer, shadowed as always by his Large Man, introduces himself.
C: BETTER OFFER
D: Zeke, you told me your wife was stunning, but I don’t think you do her justice.
C: HAZEL
D: You flatter me, Mister...?
N: She extends her hand which he takes and kisses.
C: BETTER OFFER
D: Barnes. But you can call me Better Offer.
C: ZEKE
D: Hazel, baby - Frank and I got to see a man about a horse. Why don’t you go bless Walter and the boys.
C: HAZEL
D: Sure thing. Nice to meet you, Mr. Offer.
N: They watch her head over to the band stand.
C: ZEKE
D: Real classy.
N: They heads toward the back of the club, not noticing Everett clocking the whole interaction from across the room. He’s talking to Jesse and Randolph. Jesse’s got a few in him.
C: RANDOLPH
D: You guys alright?
C: EVERETT JESSE *
D: We’re good. Yes, sir.
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 57.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Alright. Good. I told Anna I wouldn’t stay long, but I wanted to congratulate you both. Relax. Have a good time. You’re on your way.
C: JESSE
D: We not goin’ anywhere without you.
C: RANDOLPH
D: Well. I appreciate that. But Eyeball’s retired. You guys have a good night. I’m gonna check on Lucky.
N: He excuses himself. Goes over to talk to Lucky.
C: EVERETT *
D: You know we just closed on that * building. *
C: JESSE *
D: I heard. *
C: EVERETT *
D: That’s what this is all about? I * don’t tell you enough. *
C: JESSE *
D: I’m supposed to know everything. We * just closed on that building. *
C: EVERETT *
D: Thought you were focused on where * we need muscle. *
C: JESSE *
D: We need muscle everywhere. *
C: EVERETT
D: No we don’t. That’s the whole point * of branching out. Legit businesses. *
C: JESSE *
D: You’re naive, big brother. *
C: EVERETT *
D: I’m not. I know policy will always * be the engine of everything. But we * need to diversify. Not just what, * but how we do business. *
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 58.
C: JESSE
D: Maybe I oughta start my own wheel. Shit I was runnin’ numbers before you anyway.
C: EVERETT
D: Is that what you really want?
C: JESSE
D: What difference it make to you?
C: EVERETT
D: Look, man. I know I can be stubborn sometimes. That’s the way we was both raised. But never for a second - have I thought I could do any of this without you. Remember - it was me that asked you for help. And look at what we done together so far. Five years ago, nobody coulda imagined a club this big on The Stroll. A legit bank. Property. That’s why cats like Better Offer and Denver Ferguson are always comin’ to town. To see what we got goin’ in Chicago. They wanna be us. Not Everett. Not Jesse. Us.
C: JESSE
D: Don’t forget Bro-Bro. *
C: EVERETT
D: Course not. Zeke built this club.
N: Jesse looks out at the sea of Brown. Laughing, drinking, celebrating, free. In their own club. Hazel has now joined the band on stage. She joins them in a vocal rendition of “Birmingham Bertha.”
C: JESSE
D: He sure knows how to throw a party.
C: EVERETT
D: We all play our part. And this just the beginning. If we stick together.
N: He raises his glass. A beat. Jesse clinks. Spies Zeke * emerging from a back corridor with Better Offer.
C: EVERETT
D: We tight?
E: CONT’D
N: Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 59.
C: JESSE
D: Yeah. * * I need to tell that mothafucka to * leave our little brother alone? *
E: nods toward Better Offer
C: EVERETT
D: Not tonight. Let me talk to Zeke. *
C: JESSE *
D: Good idea. *
N: He steps off to go talk to Zeke just as Casper arrives with Jimmy Tillman in tow.
C: CASPER
D: Boss? Got somebody I want you to meet. This Jimmy. Got some talents I think you’ll appreciate.
C: JESSE
D: That right? Where you from?
C: JIMMY
D: Here and there, sir. Just got off the train today. Lookin’ for a fresh start...
N: ACROSS THE ROOM Everett glad hands his way through the club and catches up with Zeke who has already parted ways with Better Offer. He throws an arm around his little brother’s shoulders - walking with him in a tight embrace. Zeke plays cool, but is visibly unnerved.
C: EVERETT
D: Great party, little brother.
C: ZEKE
D: Great fight, Ev.
C: EVERETT
D: I see you beating your gums with Better Offer.
C: ZEKE
D: Just catching up is all.
C: EVERETT
D: Hope so. You know St. Louis no different than Chicago as far as we concerned.
C: ZEKE
D: I know. Don’t worry.
C: EVERETT
D: Good. I’d hate to get Jesse all riled up again.
C: ZEKE
D: Believe me - nobody wants that.
C: JESSE
D: Fuck ya’ll talkin’ about.
E: O.C.
N: Zeke smiles- silently pleading with his eyes to Everett as Jesse throws his arms around both his brothers.
C: EVERETT
D: Just how amazing Hazel is.
C: JESSE
D: I think we can all agree about that.
N: The brothers watch the performance - sincerely mesmerized. FRONT DOORS Fashionably late and ravishing in a RED DRESS, Lisa saunters into the club. The MAITRE’D practically curtsies when he greets her.
C: MAITRE’D
D: Good evening, Ms. Copeland.
C: LISA
D: Evening, Freddy.
N: She doesn’t get far before Better Offer is on her.
C: BETTER OFFER
D: As I live and breathe. Lisa Copeland - out the house and all grown up.
C: LISA
D: Mr. Barnes.
C: BETTER OFFER
D: Oh, please, Lisa. No need to be so formal...
N: AT THE BAR Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 61. Casper SLAMS A SHOT on the stick and motions for another while Jimmy is still holding his, watching him.
C: JIMMY
D: You alright?
C: CASPER
D: I’m fine. I gets a bit ancy whenever I talk to the boss.
C: JIMMY
D: I appreciate the introduction.
C: CASPER
D: Don’t mention it. Jesse handles the * business end of the business - if * you know what I’m sayin’. It ain’t * lost on me how quick you was to step to my defense today.
C: JIMMY
D: Everybody needs a friend in Chicago.
N: Casper laughs as he eyes the room.
C: CASPER
D: Speaking of Negro Heaven...
C: JIMMY
D: I’m all for it. These last few days been...
C: CASPER
D: Woo-wee!
N: Further down the bar, Casper sees a WOMAN IN A SHORT DRESS revealing beautiful, statuesque legs.
C: CASPER
D: Now that’s about my speed. She got legs just like I like ‘em.
E: CONT’D
C: JIMMY
D: How’s that?
C: CASPER
D: Feet on the bottom. Pussy on top.
C: JIMMY
D: You crazy, man.
N: Jimmy shakes his head as he scans for his own target. His eyes land on Lisa Copeland. Still hemmed up by Better Offer. Blue Rev. (10/24/20) 62.
C: JIMMY
D: I think I found my salvation.
E: CONT’D
C: CASPER
D: Best keep lookin’, Jimmy. Talkin’ to that one there’ll get you to heaven fo’ real.
C: JIMMY
D: The old man don’t seem to know that.
C: CASPER
D: Ain’t nobody stuttin’ him. Better Offer a 2nd rate King from a 2nd rate town. The Copelands’ll * straighten him out if he steps * outta line. *
C: JIMMY
D: That’s...?
C: CASPER
D: Baby sister.
C: JIMMY
D: All the more reason to help her out. *
C: CASPER
D: Fool, I introduced you.
C: JIMMY
D: Don’t worry. I’m not screwing up my * chance a’ workin’ for the Copeland * Brothers for nothin. *
N: Jimmy peels off with his drink. Casper, nervous, slams * another one and signals for two more. Jimmy crosses to Lisa and Better Offer.
C: JIMMY
D: Pardon me, Old Timer. Here’s your drink, baby. Just like you like it.
E: CONT’D to Lisa
C: BETTER OFFER
D: You know this guy?
C: JIMMY
D: Of course, she do.
C: LISA
D: Actually I don’t. I’ve never had the occasion to go to Mississippi.
C: JIMMY
D: Arkansas.
C: LISA
D: I figured you were from somewhere where they ain’t got no home training.
C: JIMMY
D: Pardon me, ma’am. Just looked like you needed some help.
C: LISA
D: Not from the likes of you.
C: BETTER OFFER
D: You want me to take this clown outside, Lisa?
C: LISA
D: I don’t need help from you either, Mr. Barnes. If you all need to prove your manhood to each other, be my guest. Good evening.
N: She walks away. Jimmy watches after her - somehow more intrigued. Better Offer steps into his field of view.
C: BETTER OFFER
D: You best mind your eyeballs.
C: JIMMY
D: You best get the fuck up out my face.
