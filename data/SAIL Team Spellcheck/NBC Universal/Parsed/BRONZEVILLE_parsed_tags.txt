S: EXT. OLD CLAPBOARD CHURCH - NIGHT
0: 
N: A full moon reflects off the Mississippi River. In a clearing
N: not far from its banks sits an old, WOODEN CHURCH.
0: 
N: Checking over his shoulder, a BLACK MAN approaches ON FOOT.
N: He knocks on the door. The sound of voices behind the door
N: immediately stop. Nervous - he waits until the door opens a
N: crack.
0: 
C:                     MAN AT DOOR (O.C.)
D:           Was you followed?
0: 
N: The Black Man shakes his head. The MAN AT DOOR sticks his
N: head out briefly, surveys the surrounding area. Satisfied, he
N: lets the Black Man inside.

S: INT. OLD CLAPBOARD CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: The Black Man enters the cramped, sweaty one room edifice to
N: a meeting already in progress.
0: 
N: He finds a seat in the PEWS that are half-filled with Black
N: men. Their haggard, thread bare clothes tell us they are not
N: men of means. The calloused hands, dirt permanently stuck
N: under their nails and worn, sun-hardened faces say they’re
N: field hands. Sitting together among them are ARTHUR GRACE,
N: (40s) heavy-set, strong, earnest and JIMMY TILLMAN (30s)
N: hungry and charismatic with a fire in his eye.
0: 
N: At the front of the room, AL MORELAND, (white, late 20s)
N: passionate, idealistic, remains silent until the door is shut
N: again. On a TABLE beside him are several staple-bound LITTLE
N: BLUE BOOKS. Some in the audience thumb through copies.

N: Another MAN, LINKWOOD, cuts him off.

C:                     LINKWOOD
D:           No disrespect, Mr. Moreland. This
D:           ain’t Alabama. Words Elaine,
D:           Arkansas mean anything to you?
0:

D:           We all know what you think,

D:           Listen. I know what happened in
D:           Elaine. I’m working toward a world
D:           where we can make sure nothin’ like
D:           that ever happens again.

C:                     LINKWOOD
D:           Now he just talkin’ crazy.
0: 
N: Linkwood leaves. As do a few others. As the door closes...

C:                     MORELAND
D:           I understand your apprehension. But
D:           I promise you, if we can stand

S: EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: Arther and Jimmy tear through the woods. Jimmy is a little
N: ahead of Arthur. Even running through dense foliage lit only
N: by moonlight, there is a precision with which he moves.
0: 
N: Arthur not so much. The big man’s FOOT catches on an UPTURNED
N: ROOT. He goes down HARD. Jimmy turns back for him.
0: 
C:                     JIMMY
D:           Get up, man. Let’s go.

0: 
0: 
N: Arthur and Jimmy turn. Another white man, SAP MAN, has
N: approached from behind. He wields a BUCHEIMER BLACKJACK SAP.
0: 
N: A look passes between Jimmy and Arthur. Jimmy undrapes
N: Arthur’s arm from his shoulders and leaves him to stand on
N: his own. He raises his hands plaintively.

C:                     JIMMY
D:           Look. We can work this...
0: 
N: Whatever Jimmy’s got to say bears no interest to White Man.
N: He SWINGS his Crow Bar HARD. Jimmy barely dodges the blow.
0: 
N: Arthur musters all his strength and leaps toward Sap Man who
N: swings the sap and connects. But Arthur is able to absorb the
N: blow with his heavy shoulders. Sap Man is surprised by his
N: strength. They struggle over the sap.
0: 
N: Jimmy dodges another blow. White Man swings wildly again.
N: This time Jimmy lets the bar come dangerously close and then
N: steps past the arc of the White Man’s follow through. He
N: surprises White Man with a quick JAB to the face. And another
N: set of rapid fire blows. The man drops his weapon as Jimmy
N: continues to back him up.
0: 
N: The sap goes flying. Arthur and Sap Man fall to the ground.
N: Arthur maneuvers to get on top of him where his weight will
N: give him the advantage. But Sap Man has another idea. He
N: reaches for the SMITH & WESSON MODEL 10 REVOLVER tucked in
N: his waist band. Arthur’s eyes go WIDE. He grabs for the gun.
0: 
N: Jimmy PUNCHES White Man with ALL HIS MIGHT. He FALLS to the
N: ground unconscious. Just as Jimmy turns to help Arthur...
0: 
N: BANG!!! BANG!!!
0: 
N: Sap Man pushes a BLOODIED, GUT SHOT Arthur off of him and
N: FIRES at Jimmy. TREE BARK explodes just behind Jimmy’s head
N: as he DIVES out of the way.
0: 
N: Sap Man scrambles to his feet FIRING ANOTHER SHOT at Jimmy
N: who scurries out of sight - grabbing the crow bar as he goes.

0: 
N: Sap Man approaches as stealthily as he can. Gun cocked and
N: ready. Up ahead - at the base of the Big Tree, he sees just
N: the TIP of JIMMY’S SHOE.
0: 
N: He approaches in silence and then whips around the trunk
N: BLASTING into...air.
0: 
N: He looks down at two EMPTY SHOES. And looks up just in time
N: to see the CROW BAR as it careens toward his...
0: 
N: THWOCCCK - the unmistakable sound of metal fracturing skull.
0: 
N: Jimmy, SOCKS ONLY adorning his feet, stands over the fallen
N: man. He swings the bar twice more to be sure. Then drops the
N: blood stained instrument. Picks up the gun. And his shoes.

D:           Oh contraire. I say “we” in

D:           constituency. I don’t cast my
D:           ballot out of rote. I want to forge

0: 
C:                     RANDOLPH
D:           There is a particular issue that

0: 
C:                      RANDOLPH
D:           It seems, since your election,
D:           there has been an inordinate and, I
D:           dare say, unnecessary amount of
D:           pressure on certain business
D:           interests.
0: 
C:                      CERMAK
D:           If you’re referring to my
D:           administration’s efforts to root
D:           out crime and corruption wherever
D:           we find it, I will remind you that
D:           I campaigned on a promise to do
D:           just that.
0: 
C:                     RANDOLPH
D:           To be clear - sporting houses are
D:           not my concern. And I applaud any
D:           attempts to curtail the violence
D:           associated with the Outfit. I speak
D:           specifically to certain non-violent
D:           efforts of colored entrepreneurs
D:           who have taken the onus of making
D:           capital investments in our

E:     (to Randolph)
D: Curtis, you are one of the first
D: and only Negros to successfully
D: open and run a bank for coloreds in
D: the entire State. Maybe the
D: country. Why’s a man of your
D: relative stature here pandering for
D: hooligans who prey upon the most
D: vulnerable of your people?
0: 
C:           RANDOLPH
D: Respectfully, the men you call
D: hooligans are the only reason there
D: is any hope in our community. A
D: community, I’ll remind you, that
D: has been historically neglected and
D: marginalized in every possible way.
0:

D: I beg your pardon.

C:           CERMAK
D: Let’s cut to the quick, shall we?
D: You want the police to lay off the
