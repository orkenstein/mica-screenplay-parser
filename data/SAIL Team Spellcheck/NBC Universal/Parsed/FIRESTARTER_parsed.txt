S: INT. BABY NURSERY - DAY
C: AS
D: A COOING NEWBORN, nestled at her mother’s breast, feeding. VICKY McGEE rocks the child in a chair by an open window. 26 and bright-eyed, Vicky gazes down at the bundle of joy cradled in her arms. She wipes milk from baby’s cheek with a cloth. Then she looks up and smiles at...
C: BI
D: ANDY McGEE, standing in the doorway, looking lovingly upon his wife and child. He’s 27, with an All-American smile. Soft morning light filters in, glows Vicky’s hair like a halo.
C: R
D: A gentle breeze flutters the long, sheer curtains. An idyllic scene, a heightened reality, dreamlike...
C: FO
D: Vicky lays the child gently in the nearby crib, then pulls the string on the colorful MOBILE that hangs above it. The mobile spins slowly, playing a familiar lullaby. Then Vicky takes Andy’s hand, leads him down the hallway toward the bedroom.
C: K
D: IN THE CRIB, the child lies there a moment, staring up at mobile as it spins, spins, spins... EC
N: Then a whimper, soft. Then another. Perhaps she wasn’t finished feeding. Or just misses the warmth of mother’s embrace. Either way, baby starts to cry. Quietly at first. Then louder, louder... Then VIBRATIONS. H DOWN THE HALL, Vicky turns into the bedroom. But Andy stops, turns back. A strange feeling hitting him... LC IN THE CRIB, the air DISTORTS SLIGHTLY around the child’s head as she cries. Like WAVES OF HEAT rising off hot pavement. Tears come harder now. Pain? Fear? Vibrations grow stronger. Sweat beads on baby’s forehead. Flowers wilt across the room. EL Then the spinning mobile CATCHES FIRE... TENDRILS OF SMOKE waft out from the doorway... SP Andy RUSHES back to the room... He turns into the doorway... The flaming mobile... Crib full of smoke... ON ANDY’S FACE as he arrives at the crib, leans over the railing... and gasps in horror at what he sees inside. His baby’s head engulfed in flames. SUDDENLY--
S: INT. MCGEE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - PREDAWN
N: ANDY WAKES WITH A START. He sits up in bed, sweating, trying to catch his breath. Rattled by the nightmare.
C: AS
D: He turns to the body lying beside him. It’s Vicky, though we don’t see her face. Turned away, fast asleep. Andy climbs warily out of bed and shuffles to the bathroom. Outside the windows, the deep blue of predawn.
C: BI
D: INT. MCGEE HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - PREDAWN LIGHTS POP ON, revealing Andy’s naked torso, covered in SCARS. Small and not so small. On his arms, legs, neck. Burn marks.
C: R
D: He’s a decade older now, too. Mid-30s.
C: FO
D: He splashes water on his face. We might wonder if he’s coming off a three-day bender. Lines branch out from the corners of his tired, bloodshot eyes. His short hair flecked with grey.
S: INT. MCGEE HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Andy shuffles down the darkened hallway, peers into a BEDROOM.
C: K
D: But the small bed inside is empty. This gives Andy pause.
C: ANDY
D: EC
N: Charlie?
S: INT. MCGEE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Andy enters the kitchen, stops. A FIGURE sits at the table, H unmoving. Then a cigarette lighter STRIKES, illuminating the face of the silhouette. A young girl, 11. This is CHARLIE. LC
C: ANDY
D: Where’d you find that? The flame goes out. Her face becomes silhouette. She tosses a PACK OF CIGARETTES across the table. EL
C: CHARLIE
D: You promised you’d quit.
C: ANDY
D: It’s not so easy. SP
N: She strikes it again. Her serious eyes focus on the flame.
C: ANDY
D: Why are you awake, Charlie?
N: The flame goes out. Darkness.
C: CHARLIE
D: Bad dream...
C: AS ANDY
D: Wanna talk about it? She strikes it again. ANDY
C: BI
D: Put that down, please. It’s not a toy. She sets it on the table. Andy hits the light. We see Charlie more clearly now. She’s scared, troubled.
C: R CHARLIE
D: Daddy... Something feels weird, in my body. Something’s changing.
C: FO ANDY
D: ...Maybe that’s a conversation you could have with your mother.
C: CHARLIE
D: I don’t mean that thing. I mean the other thing... The Bad Thing.
C: K
D: He knows what the Bad Thing is. But he covers his concern. He studies his daughter’s eyes. Fear. Darkness. Then, carefully: EC
C: ANDY
D: You remember your tools, right? Andy glances over to FRESH FLOWERS in a vase on the hutch. H
C: ANDY
D: Flowers... LC
N: Then he turns, looks at a “CAT CLOCK” on the wall, its eyes turning back and forth and back and forth.
C: ANDY
D: Clock... EL
N: Then to one of CHARLIE’S DRAWINGS on the fridge, a bucolic scene of a forest and a deer by a stream.
C: ANDY
D: Forest... Deer... SP
N: Saying the words with calm and rhythm, like a mantra. Finally Andy’s eyes settle on Charlie.
C: ANDY
D: ...and Sweet Charlie.
N: Charlie breathes, calming. Andy sits at the table beside her, puts his hand on hers.
C: ANDY
D: You’ll be fine. The Bad Thing’s been
C: AS
D: gone a long time. And you’re strong, Charlie. Don’t ever forget...
C: VICKY
D: Everything okay in here?
E: O.S.
C: BI
D: They turn. Vicky, now mid-30s too, standing at the door, rubbing sleep from her eyes. Andy looks at Charlie, who smiles back, her fears assuaged. At least for now. ANDY
C: R
D: How bout I make us breakfast? He stands again, walks to the fridge, giving Vicky a kiss on the cheek as he passes. Vicky moves to the table, sits next
C: FO
D: to Charlie and puts an arm around her. AS WE PULL BACK, taking in this loving family scene, we see a dusty old FIRE EXTINGUISHER hidden in the corner. We’ll soon discover there’s one in every room of the house.
C: K
D: MUSIC HITS AS WE ROLL CREDITS: EC
N: A discordant sequence. Image and sound distorted, manipulated. As if coming to us from some distant past, a memory...
C: A BLACK SCREEN
D: H
N: Speckled with video noise, it shudders before late ‘90s font pops up. The text reads: LC LOT Six trial - “3” - 4/5/2003 Dept. of Scientific Intelligence J. Wanless, MD (lead) The black screen holds a beat before it cuts to: EL
S: INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY (2003)
N: Staring into the lens of a Sony Handycam is YOUNG ANDY MCGEE, 21 and fresh-faced, with his whole life ahead of him. SP He sits in a chair in front of a bland beige wall, answering a series of questions from an UNSEEN MAN.
C: UNSEEN MAN
D: Do you exercise?
E: O.S.

E: 2003
N: SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE of a different small, windowless room. A dozen COLLEGE KIDS settle onto cots, as RESEARCH ASSISTANTS in white lab coats hook them to blood pressure cuffs and IVs. We glimpse Young Andy among the students. H Some of the White Coats hold syringes, others hold IV bags, the words “LOT SIX” scrawled upon them in thick black ink. LC

C: VICKY
D: Do you know your parents’ blood types?
C: UNSEEN MAN
D: Fair enough. Where do they live now? Your parents.
E: O.S.
C: VICKY
D: They don’t. Died when I was ten. Beat.
C: AS UNSEEN MAN

C: FO
D: Young Andy reclines on a cot, and now we see Young Vicky in the cot beside him. Other students on cots scattered about. Needles pierce veins. Blood swirls in syringes. White Coats drip drugs into the arms of the college kids. Standing at the front, observing it all, is the old and ominous DR. JOSEPH WANLESS. He makes notes on paper, watching.
C: K UNSEEN MAN
D: And you were raised in a group home, EC
E: PRE-LAP

C: ANDY
D: ...Since I was seven, yeah.
C: UNSEEN MAN
D: So who is your closest living relative, geographically? EL
E: O.S.
N: (off Andy’s confusion) What family member lives nearest you? Andy eyes the Unseen Man, growing skeptical.
C: ANDY
D: SP
N: The ad said this was just an FDA clinical trial...? HARD SPLICE TO:
S: INT. TESTING ROOM - DAY (2003)
N: The IV drips. Andy is splayed out on the cot, helplessly stoned. He studies his hands as if they’re foreign objects.
C: AS
D: Vicky giggles, tripping. She stands now, begins dancing to the rhythms in her head. Andy watches her, entranced. Around the room, strange feelings abound. More tripping and laughter, weaving in and out of the white, antiseptic noise...

S: INT. TESTING ROOM - DAY (2003)
N: Several students are standing now, swaying to the music in their heads. One pulls out his IV and dances across the room. SP But in moment, things turn... People grab at their temples as migraines strike like iron spikes. Muscles cramp and seize. Dizziness. The room spins... And objects fly. Paper cups, hand towels, IV bags. And a deadly hail of pens and pencils. People duck and cover. Some get struck, go down.
C: AS
D: MORE WHITE COATS flood the room. Seizures over here, cardiac arrest over there. It’s madness. Vicky and Andy move toward each other in the chaos, terrified. Is this real? She reaches out for comfort. He takes her hand.

N: HARD SPLICE TO:
S: INT. TESTING ROOM - DAY (2003)
N: UTTER CHAOS. Objects FLY and people SCREAM. Andy and Vicky SP hide behind a file cabinet, clinging together. Then A MAN IN THE CORNER grabs at his own terrified eyes. Digs his fingers into the sockets. And screams like holy hell. The White Coats descend, wrestle him down, try to sedate him. WE PUSH THROUGH THE MOB to find the man at the bottom of the pile, thick red blood pouring from his two eyeless sockets.
C: AS
D: The eyeballs dangle like charms from his raised hand.
C: EYELESS YOUNG MAN
D: I still see it! I still see it! White Coats grab at his hand, knock the eyeballs loose. But
C: BI

D: RUNDOWN SEDAN moving through this small, suburban town in Western Mass. Trees alive with spring foliage. EC
S: EXT. STRIP MALL - MORNING
N: The sedan parks in this retail wasteland. Andy at the wheel, studying his face in the rearview. He drips a few EYEDROPS into his reddened eyes, wipes away the runoff. H He approaches the strip mall -- Dry Cleaners, Jewelry Shop, Shoe Repair -- pulls out a set of keys and opens the door of LC a nondescript storefront. There’s a homemade sign hung in the window: “CONFIDENCE ASSOCIATES.” Andy steps inside...
S: INT. SCHOOL BUS - MOVING - MORNING
N: EL Charlie at the back of the bus, in a pair of faded overalls, well-worn sneakers. She sits in silence, holding an old RABBIT’S FOOT. Her thumb runs over the fur in small circles. She eyes TWO GIRLS in the seat diagonal, watching videos on their phones. Giggling. Best friends. Charlie looks away. SP The bus comes to a stop in front of LEWISTON ELEMENTARY. Charlie pulls on her small backpack and files off the yellow bus, following the other kids, one by one...
S: INT. MCGEE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Vicky at the table, searching the CLASSIFIED ADS of the local paper. In RED MARKER, she’s circled several computer/software postings. But most have been crossed out.
C: AS
D: She circles an ad for a “Full Stack Java Engineer,” then dials a number on the CORDLESS PHONE.
C: VICKY
D: I’m calling about the listing in the
C: BI
D: Gazette, Java Engineer... No, but I’m quick learner... Not exactly that but... I see, yes, okay... Thanks anyways. She hangs up then turns back to the paper, undeterred. She

D: Close your eyes. Now concentrate. Think of Skinny
E: she does, reluctantly
C: FO
D: Darla. Imagine her. At the beach. Darla likes what she hears. Dreaming with eyes closed. Andy takes a quiet breath, preparing. Then he seems to summon something from deep within him. A
C: K
D: kind of guttural strength or power. It makes him nauseated but he swallows it down and... EC
C: ANDY
D: Now look me in the eyes. She opens her eyes. He is very close to her. Looking deeply into her pupils. It’s powerfully intimate. Darla is disarmed. H
C: ANDY
D: Don’t look away. No matter what. Then Andy cracks his neck, resulting in a little “pop.” Darla LC
N: swallows. Andy’s stare intensifies. As does his nausea. But he fights it down, holds the focused gaze. Then: A LOW RUMBLE rattles the soundtrack... A small SHIVER runs EL through Andy... A web of blood vessels BURST in his eyes... Then Darla’s pupils subtly DILATE. Bingo. Darla stares in rapt attention, as though hypnotized. Andy breathes through the pain. The clock is ticking. SP
C: ANDY
D: You feel better already, Darla. Lighter. You’re not hungry right now. You don’t like the taste of chocolate. ...And a hundred bucks is a steal.
N: A tense beat, waiting for a response... Then Darla smiles.

C: FO DARLA
D: Don’t know how I ever liked those things. Keep it. See you next week! Darla bounds out of the office, full of surprising energy... But the second she’s out of sight, Andy drops heavy into the chair. All energy drained from him. A massive migraine spikes
C: K
D: his temples. He grabs at them, tries to breathe through it. IN ANDY’S POV, the room blurs. Sounds are distorted in his EC
N: throbbing head. Quiet sounds are jackhammers, loud sounds are silent. It’s disorienting. His heartbeat pounds in his brain. He grips the chair, white-knuckled. Waiting for it to pass. It only lasts a few seconds, but it’s a motherfucker. Then: H A SMALL DOT OF BLOOD forms in the corner of his eye. He wipes it, thinking it’s a teardrop. Then he sees the smear of red on his finger. He stares at it, shocked. Wipes it on his shirt. LC

S: INT. LEWISTON ELEMENTARY - CLASSROOM - DAY
N: EL A DEAD FROG. Pinned to a styrofoam board, legs spread-eagle. A SMALL KNIFE makes a nervous slice down the middle... but it goes too deep. Frog guts spill onto the styrofoam.
C: GAVIN
D: Ewww... SP
E: O.S.
N: Charlie holds the knife, frowning above the frog. GAVIN stands beside her. 11, buzzcut. He’s a dick.
C: GAVIN
D: Nice work, goober.
C: MS. GARDNER
D: How’s it going over here, Gavin? MS. GARDNER, 20s, approaches. Gavin points at the failed experiment, distancing himself from it.
E: O.S.
C: AS GAVIN
D: Amish girl killed our frog.

C: BI GAVIN
D: But now it’s extra dead. Charlie darkens, embarrassed.
C: R CHARLIE
D: I’m not Amish.
C: FO MS. GARDNER
D: It’s okay, Charlie. To make an omelette, you gotta break a few eggs. Or a few frogs, I guess. Charlie doesn’t quite follow the analogy. Gavin turns back to his desk, shaking his head. Ms. Gardner leans in, whispers.
C: K MS. GARDNER
D: Let’s be honest, a quick Google search EC
N: will show you all the frog guts you want, perfectly dissected. We don’t even need to do this anymore. She smiles, but Charlie doesn’t, because: H

D: LC
N: Right, sorry. (thinking) You ever go to the public library? You can use the computers there, you know. Maybe ask your mom to take you? EL

N: actually believes.

C: GAVIN
D: Is it true that Amish families share the same bathwater? Cause that’s weird.
C: R
D: You’re weird. Charlie closes her eyes, GRITTING HER TEETH with anger...
C: FO
D: Then SMALL WAVES OF HEAT appear around her. Like the kind that rise off hot pavement. Charlie opens her eyes, shocked. An old thermometer hangs on the wall. Its mercury RISES a bit. The edge of Charlie’s drawing CURLS slightly. She covers it.
C: K
D: Gavin sits up, confused. Wipes his forehead, suddenly warm. EC
N: Charlie looks nervously around her desk, eyeing OBJECTS. She whispers the names to herself:

N: Paper. Eraser. Ruler. Calculator... Ms. Gardner hears her muffled words up front.

D: SP
N: ...Yes, Ms. Gardner. Everything’s fine. But her eyes tell us a different story.
S: EXT/INT. MCGEE HOUSE/ANDY’S CAR - EVENING
N: Andy’s car pulls into the drive and parks. The modest house is not exactly rundown, but could certainly use some work. Neighbors on either side, but not too close.
C: AS

S: INT. MCGEE HOUSE - CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - EVENING
C: BI
D: Charlie on her bed, drawing in her sketchbook with colored pencils. Intensely focused. We may only now notice how antiquated the McGee house seems.
C: R
D: No iPhones or laptops in sight, no screens of any kind. NOW WE SEE: Charlie’s drawn a picture of Gavin from school.
C: FO
D: His face looking all screwed-up. Studying her pencils, Charlie hesitates a moment before... Grabbing the red and drawing flames on him. Sweat beads break out of her forehead as she colors furiously, adding more flames and smoke before--
C: K VICKY
D: Charlie, wash your hands! EC
E: O.S.
N: --Charlie pauses, looks at what she’s drawn, curious, as though it was done in some kind of haze. She scribbles the drawing out, burying it beneath a layer of black.
S: INT. MCGEE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER
N: H Dinner at the humble table. Andy, in a t-shirt now, serves Charlie some chicken casserole. She pokes around with her LC fork, looking dour. Vicky notices, tries for family bonding.
C: VICKY

C: ANDY
D: I’ll go first. Best thing that happened today was... I got three new clients!

C: AS

N: in the bathroom. Vicky and Andy exchange looks. He defers to her on this one. LC
C: VICKY
D: Well, Charlie. A diaphragm is a... contraption of sorts. It goes inside a woman’s vagina. EL

C: VICKY
D: And its function, really, is to block-- Who is Jenny Wolski and why is she SP
E: wait a sec--
N: talking about diaphragms? She’s ten.

C: AS VICKY
D: And boobs have nothing to do with diaphragms! Let’s change the subject! Andy stifles a laugh.

C: R
D: And just like that, Charlie darkens again. ANDY
C: FO

C: CHARLIE
D: SP
N: We can’t even have smartphones. All I want is stupid wifi. That’s normal.

C: K ANDY
D: I’ll come for you. Now go! EC
N: Rainbird appears around the edge of the house. Charlie’s eyes dart between Andy and Rainbird... AT LAST SHE RUNS, quickly vanishing in the thick overgrowth. H Andy exhales deeply, then drags himself towards one of the dead cops, reaching for his gun but-- LC Rainbird’s boot finds it first, kicks it away.

S: EXT. FOREST - DUSK
N: H The sun fading. Charlie wanders, lost. Afraid. Wondering what to do, how she will find her way out. How she will survive. LC IN A CLEARING, she gathers wood, makes a pile on the forest floor. But there’s UNDERBRUSH everywhere, she does not clear it. If it catches fire, the whole forest could go up. Charlie stands over the pile of wood, focusing... Gathering the nerve to use her power.

D: She’d fallen asleep by the unlit wood pile. She sits up, scared. Trying to settle her nerves, Charlie says her mantra.

N: THE OLD HOTEL. An apparition in the deep woods. Only there a moment, then it fades away with the sound of the waves. Charlie stands, confused and hungry. Dirty and cold. Still no SP sense of direction. Just trees surrounding on all sides. She sets off through the trees.

S: EXT. ANOTHER BACK ROAD - DAY
N: The sun is high in the sky as Charlie walks a lonely back road, sprinkled lightly with houses and cars. EL She eyes the houses as she passes them. Laundry hangs from a line in one yard. A small CHILD plays on his jungle gym. Then LAUGHTER draws Charlie out of her reverie. SP IN THE DISTANCE, THREE BOYS approach on bikes. They cruise past Charlie, wearing backpacks and ballcaps. On their way home from school, they’re probably thirteen. A few yards past, they circle back, pass by again. Checking out this weird kid, her clothes dirty and torn, hair a mess.

D: Charlie, stop! EC
N: Andy can hardly keep his eyes open. A long beat, Charlie’s eyes boring holes through Hollister... It’s a game of chicken. Then Charlie pulls off her jacket, stamps out the fire. H Andy’s head droops again. His eyes are fully bloodshot, past the point of no return. LC

C: CHARLIE
D: SP
N: But I’m not... I hurt someone, outside... I broke my promise... I’m so sorry, Daddy... Tears form in her eyes. VIBRATIONS return.

C: AS ANDY

C: K CAPTAIN HOLLISTER
D: Whoa, easy now. Burn me and you burn him too. EC
N: Charlie just stares, but in disbelief or hypnosis, it’s impossible to say...
C: CAPTAIN HOLLISTER

C: CHARLIE
D: I love you so much, Daddy. EL
N: Then her gaze turns from Andy... And she focuses on Hollister. She exhales slowly and cracks her neck -- the push. Instantly, the Captain’s pupils dilate. Charlie leans in and the Armed Guards step closer. SP A tense beat before the lights flicker. Suddenly brightening.
C: CHARLIE
D: Let my Daddy go. THE TEMPERATURE RISES.
N: Hollister wraps her arms around Andy and squeezes hard.
C: CAPTAIN HOLLISTER
D: Don’t do this!
C: AS
D: IN AN INSTANT the cell is pulsing with heat. Charlie’s stare intensifies. Hollister begins to tremble... Muscles twitch and contort, violently... CHARLIE

C: R
D: Charlie is burning her from the inside out. CAPTAIN HOLLISTER
C: FO
D: Stop... Stop... She pulls herself from Andy, steps back, waves to the Armed Guards. They stand down, holstering their weapons. Smoke stops curling from her nostrils and mouth. Hollister coughs several times to clear it. Wipes away sweat and soot.
C: K CAPTAIN HOLLISTER
D: Go on. Open it up. EC
E: to the Armed Guards
N: With a clank, a lock is undone and a door to the side of the glass cell opens. Hollister ushers Andy out, undoes his handcuffs. Beaming, Charlie runs to her father. Andy sweeps her up in his arms. H
C: ANDY
D: Sweet Charlie. LC
N: The moment is heightened, dreamlike...
C: CHARLIE I kept my promise.
D: EL
C: ANDY
D: Yes, you did. Holding his daughter, Andy turns to the Captain.

N: be too. You’re going to change the world, Sweet Charlie... They look up -- SNOWFLAKES drift slowly down from the sky. Charlie smiles and hugs Andy close... But WE PUSH in on Andy H to see his pupils are DILATED... The pupils open LARGER and LARGER as...

EL Andy is NOT OUTSIDE but still in the--
S: INT. “SHOP" HQ - ANDY’S CELL - NIGHT
N: SP --AND HE IS ON FIRE. Oblivious to the heat, Andy is lost in the pushed reverie. Burning violently with the Captain wrapped around him. Charlie has pushed the escape, the kept promise, into his mind. But it was too easy. It was a lie.
C: AS
D: Hollister’s mouth moves frantically, but her lungs and vocal cords cannot make words. Sounds choked with hisses and smoke. The skin on the Captain’s face bubbles, then bursts. Her hands and arms and chest follow suit.
C: BI
D: The heat in the room is remarkable now. The foot-thick glass
C: MOANS AND CRACKS.
D: Andy smiles, eyes glazed over in a beatific fugue state with Hollister’s burning body wrapped around his own, and...
C: R ANDY
D: Charlie...
C: FO CHARLIE
D: I love you so much, Daddy. Andy’s eyes roll back in his head, as the fire consumes his body and Charlie, no tears in her eyes, focuses on Hollister, roasting meat before she falls, crumbling, to the floor.
C: K
D: Dead. THE GLASS WALL SHATTERS-- CHARLIE IS BLOWN BACK by the force-- EC
N: ALARMS SOUND-- SPRINKLERS RAIN DOWN-- Charlie climbs slowly to her feet, rattled but alive. She stands alone as water rains upon her, clearing the smoke. H No remains of Andy or Hollister to be found. Blasted to nothing. LC Charlie breathes.

D: drawn. Charlie sends out the power-- THEIR HEADS CATCH FIRE like human matchsticks. They fall to the ground, flailing. Even the sprinklers can’t relieve them. Charlie marches by them toward the door they sprang from. UNTIL ONE OF THEM GRABS HER ANKLE--
C: K
D: HE YANKS HER UPON HIM. She slaps and kicks at the burning man until finally the agent dies and the fire is out. EC
N: She scrambles to her feet, holes in her jeans from the burns. She’s covered in blood and black flesh, soaked with water. She stumbles to the door. It opens onto: H

S: INT. “SHOP" HQ - LEVEL SIX - CONTINUOUS
N: --a hallway that stretches out before her. Endless doors line the hall, countless corridors bisect it. SP Charlie marches down the hall, undeterred. A DOOR OPENS behind her and an AGENT leans out, gun drawn. Charlie feels his presence and spins -- THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT, pinning the agent between the door and doorframe.
C: AGENT
D: Agh-- He drops the gun. The door presses in on his sternum, his face. His breathing is labored, trying to pry it off, but it

D: won’t budge. Charlie heaves forward-- --and we hear the soft crack of breaking bones, then the agent goes limp. Charlie watches the life go from him. She ends the power and he drops like a stone.

D: Then she THROWS THE HEAT and it blasts them into the back wall -- and through it. Just a smoldering crater is left. Charlie spins to see a FEMALE AGENT racing away.
C: CHARLIE K
D: Stop! The agent obeys, throws her hands in the air. She’s trembling. EC
C: FEMALE AGENT

C: GAIL
D: EL
N: I just wanna get home to them... ...But she feels them, and suddenly turns on them, sending TWO SPIRALS OF HEAT instantly through them. A hole in each man’s chest, punched clean through. The size of a softball. SP They drop dead to the floor.
C: GAIL
D: ...Fuck me.

D: Then there is only the sound of the flickering flames against the spray of the sprinklers. There is no one left to kill.
C: FO
D: Charlie marches up the stairs, through the fire and corpses. Then onto the top floor...
S: INT. “SHOP" HQ - MAIN HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: ...Back where she started. Charlie walks the empty hallway.
C: K
D: Sprinklers raining down, but she doesn’t care. She throws open doors with her mind, searching. But the rooms are empty, too. EC
N: She passes a window -- and sees her reflection. It stops her. Blood and darkness cover her. A little girl, lost. She blinks. As if coming to from the fog. The push is lifting. And as she stares at the frightful image, a strange thing H happens. The sprinklers wash away the blood. Charlie emerges from beneath the mask of destruction. The last LC strains of hope. She reaches the last door, throws it open... And there he is. Alone, strapped to a chair like her father. His face bloodied and bruised from a brutal beating. Rainbird. EL They stare at each other a long, tense beat.

D: You should leave if you want to live. EC
N: Then she turns and walks away. Rainbird watches her go, quietly astonished.
S: EXT. “SHOP" HQ - PREDAWN
N: H The blackened windows do not betray the devastation inside. The front door opens. Charlie exits into the quiet night. LC She walks through the parking lot, heading for the beach. MOMENTS LATER, Rainbird exits. Follows her path like a shadow. Charlie glances back, sees that he’s clear of the building... EL Then the Old Hotel explodes. As though hit by an atomic bomb. It lights up the sky, the ocean. Wood and glass and metal and brick blast into the night. The SP heat shatters windows hundreds of yards away. The power takes something from Charlie. She buckles, but keeps walking. Rainbird continues behind her.
S: EXT. THE BEACH - DAWN
N: Charlie reaches the surf, as the Old Hotel burns in the distance behind her. She takes off her shoes. Her toes dabble in the water. She splashes some on her face, cleans it.
C: AS
D: She glances behind her, but Rainbird is gone. She looks into the darkness a long beat, but cannot see him. She sits on the sand, staring out at the water. Tapped out, exhausted. She falls back on the sand. Her eyes close.

D: A long beat. Charlie asleep on the beach. Then two feet appear beside her. Rainbird bends, lifts her up.

D: The sun breaks the horizon, creeps into the sky. We frame them against the red orb glowing.
C: FO
D: The little girl and the monster. Charlie’s eyes slowly open. She looks up at the man. Then back at the hotel, far in the distance. Engulfed in flames. Firetrucks and cop cars arrive on the scene. People film the devastation on their phones.
C: K
D: Charlie watches it all for a moment, then turns back to Rainbird. She nods, then her head droops again. She sleeps. EC
