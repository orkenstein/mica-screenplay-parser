S: INT. LOS ANGELES - CAR - NIGHT
N: Close on Teddy grooving to an upbeat, empowering song.
S: EXT. DRIVE-THRU RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
N: Reveal that she is in her car at a fast food restaurant order box. She turns off the music and rolls down the window.
C: ORDER GUY
D: Hi, can I take your order, please?
E: O.C.
C: TEDDY
D: Yes, I’ll have the number three. Only, no cheese. Actually, can I get the cheese on the side?
E: firmly then
N: A beat.
C: ORDER GUY
D: How?
E: O.C.
C: TEDDY
D: Never mind, leave it.
C: ORDER GUY
D: Okay, number three. Do you want fries with that?
E: O.C.
N: Teddy turns to camera.
C: TEDDY
D: Is there a stupider question? Of course I want fries with that. Who doesn’t want fries with everything? No fries.
E: then, to box
C: ORDER GUY
D: But don’t you deserve it? You’ve been really good lately.
E: O.C.
C: TEDDY
D: Whoa. How do you know that?
C: ORDER GUY
D: I don’t. It’s what you told me to say the last time you were here.
E: O.C.
N: Teddy glances at the camera, yeah, did do that.
C: TEDDY
D: Thing is, I want like three fries.
C: ORDER GUY
D: So throw the rest out.
C: TEDDY
D: Dude, so wasteful--
N: SFX: Phone text sound. Teddy glances at it. It’s a text from “James.” Her background photo is a picture of she and James (30s, so handsome). It reads: “where are you?” Teddy texts back: “gym” James: “good girl”
C: TEDDY
D: I still might go.
E: CONT'D to camera
S: INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Lisa (50s, never at her ideal weight) is smudging in liner as she watches a YouTube tutorial on mastering the smokey eye. One eye is garishly made up. From the laptop we hear:
C: GLOTTAL FRY VOICE
D: ...and the great thing is this look looks great on everyone.
E: V.O.
N: She picks up her phone.
S: INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
C: TEDDY
D: Look, you know how when you take everything out of the big bag there’s always a few renegade fries at the bottom? I just want the ones that would have escaped on their own.
E: to box
N: SFX: Phone FaceTime chime. Teddy glances at it: MOM
C: ORDER GUY
D: You need to get that?
E: O.C.
C: TEDDY
D: It’s just my mom.
C: ORDER GUY
D: My mom died a few years ago. I wish I could take calls from her.
E: O.C.
C: TEDDY
D: Okay, fine. Hi Mom. And no fries.
E: answers phone then, to box
C: LISA
D: What?
C: TEDDY
D: Not you.
N: SFX: Car honking behind her.
C: TEDDY
D: Why be a dick?
E: CONT'D to car
C: LISA
D: What?
C: TEDDY
D: Not you! Mom, enough with the smokey eye tutorials.
E: then, noticing
C: LISA
D: But this one was for mature eyes, I couldn’t resist.
C: TEDDY
D: Repeat after me: no one masters the smokey eye. What’s up?
C: LISA
D: I joined a new support group and I need you to come with me.
C: TEDDY
D: Why?
C: LISA
D: To support me.
C: TEDDY
D: Isn’t that what the group is for?
C: LISA
D: It’ll be my birthday present.
C: TEDDY
D: Can’t I just get you a candle?
C: LISA
D: You can do that, too. Something that smells like cookies, but not in a way that makes me want cookies, in a way that makes me feel like I’m already eating cookies.
N: Teddy is now at the window. The Order Guy (20s, gives off nothing) hands her the food.
C: ORDER GUY
D: Here you go.
C: LISA
D: Who’s that? Please tell me you’re on a date with someone new.
C: TEDDY
D: Not on a date.
C: ORDER GUY
D: You could be. I get off soon.
C: LISA
D: He sounds nice. Let me see him.
C: TEDDY
D: Bye, mom.
S: INT. HIKING TRAIL - DAY - NEXT DAY
N: Lisa and Teddy hike up a canyon trail, both out of breath.
C: LISA
D: I think they meet at the top of this hill.
C: TEDDY
D: You said that about the last one.
C: LISA
D: This group is going to finally get my food stuff under control.
C: TEDDY
D: You said that about the last one.
C: LISA
D: It’s only been around a few months, very non-judgemental.
C: TEDDY
D: Well, that’s good.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: On your left!
E: O.C.
N: Wednesday (28-35, super fit) zips past in skin-tight gear.
C: TEDDY
D: On your left! Look at me.
E: imitating her
C: LISA
D: Hate her.
C: TEDDY
D: Me, too.
C: LISA
D: Anyway, it’s very non-judgemental.
C: TEDDY
D: Super important.
C: LISA
D: Especially with women. Y’know, this group could be good for you too, Teddy. Men come, you could meet someone.
C: TEDDY
D: I have someone.
C: LISA
D: He doesn’t count as a someone. He’s married.
C: TEDDY
D: No, he’s divorced... in every way except he’s still married. In fact... Tonight is our anniversary. And he likes it when I’m bold. So. I’m. Going to propose.
C: LISA
D: You’re going to propose?
C: TEDDY
D: Mom, women propose. It’s so not a big deal. It’s a huge deal. I’m so nervous. Do women propose?
E: to camera
C: LISA
D: It’s not because you’re a woman. It’s because he’s married.
C: TEDDY
D: The divorce is this close to being finalized.
C: LISA
D: Do you want me to respond as your mother or your friend?
C: TEDDY
D: Neither.
C: LISA
D: Well, both of us think it’s a terrible idea. Honey, even if he weren’t married I wouldn’t like him. He’s controlling and critical.
C: TEDDY
D: He just wants me to be the best I can be.
S: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
N: Teddy and James are in bed, very close to the finish line.
C: TEDDY
D: You and me... are so good together.
E: moaning
C: JAMES
D: You and I.
C: TEDDY
D: Mmmmm.... yeah.
C: JAMES
D: No, you said you and me.
E: still thrusting MORE
C: JAMES
D: “I” is a subject pronoun and “me” is an object pronoun.
E: CONT'D as he’s coming, words strained
C: TEDDY
D: Yeah, I know. But look at him.
E: to camera
S: EXT. HIKING TRAIL - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Lisa and Teddy reach the bluff where the group is gathered. There are about fifteen people of various ages and sizes.
C: LISA
D: Oh, thank God. I’m not the oldest of the biggest one here. “On your left” girl.
E: then, nudging Teddy
C: TEDDY
D: What’s she doing here?
N: They watch as Wednesday takes out a pouch of almonds, eats one and puts it away.
C: TEDDY
D: One almond. What kind of freak just eats one almond?
E: CONT'D to camera
N: Jared (28-35, a specimen) approaches.
C: JARED
D: Welcome, ladies. I’m Jared.
C: TEDDY
D: Damnnn.
E: to camera, lowering imaginary sunglasses
C: JARED
D: We’ll start in a few. Stoked to have you.
N: Lisa and Teddy melt as they babble non-words. Linus (28-35, a bear but doesn’t want to be), chatting with Nicole (28-35, proudly big) and Cooper (28-35, a little chubby), notices them.
C: LINUS
D: Hey, perfectly arched brows. Over here.
N: Lisa and Teddy look at each other.
C: LINUS
D: Both of you. It’s clearly genetic gold.
E: CONT'D
N: Lisa and Teddy cross over.
C: LINUS
D: First off... This is all snatched. Love me a peeky mesh moment. So, what brings us?
E: CONT'D re: Teddy’s look
C: TEDDY
D: I’m just here because of my mother.
C: LINUS
D: Aren’t we all? No offense.
E: to Lisa
C: LISA
D: None taken. My mom did a number on me. But Teddy and I, we’re like the Gilmore Girls.
C: TEDDY
D: Yeah, but like ten years later, which would have been sad.
C: LISA
D: What about the Gilmore Girls reunion?
C: TEDDY
D: That was sad.
C: LISA
D: But we watched it.
C: LINUS
D: So you’re sad. But watchable.
C: NICOLE
D: I can’t even tell my mother I’m here. Or my boyfriend. Every time I say I want to eat better he’s all “You better not lose that sweetness down below.” Look how squirmy that makes him.
E: re: Cooper
C: COOPER
D: I’m not squirmy.
C: LINUS
D: You should see how he gets when we talk about dicks.
C: COOPER
D: There’s a lot of dick talk.
E: matter-of-factly
C: LINUS
D: So obviously straight. No offense.
E: re: Cooper
C: COOPER
D: Not sure why that’s offensive.
C: LINUS
D: And there’s your privilege showing.
C: LISA
D: How FUN are they?
E: to Teddy
C: JARED
D: Hey everyone, Danny’s running late, but let’s get started.
E: calling out
N: Everyone takes a seat. Teddy sits between Cooper and Lisa.
C: JARED
D: For my newbies, this is not a weight loss group, it’s a food issues group. I am not a doctor or an eating disorder specialist so if you need that, this is not for you. But if you want to break bad habits and change your body, or break bad thinking and change the way you see your body, this method will set you free. And that’s why I named it The Free Method.
E: CONT'D
C: TEDDY
D: But it’s not free of charge.
E: raising hand
C: JARED
D: No.
C: TEDDY
D: But doesn’t that get kind of confu--
C: JARED
D: Look, I already bought the URL. Plus, it worked for me. I used to weigh four hundred big ones. It’s all about turning Negativity into Positivity.
N: Everyone nods like that was profound.
C: COOPER
D: He said nothing.
E: under his breath
N: Teddy stifles a GIGGLE, which pleases Cooper. Danny (28-35, John Candy big) arrives, out of breath, wearing a dark suit.
C: DANNY
D: Sorry I’m late. Funeral.
C: LISA
D: Oh, I’m so sorry.
C: DANNY
D: Don’t be. I’m a funeral director. Mahogany casket, five hundred mourners. Few more of those I’m buying a party boat. Wait, I know you. You had that morning cooking show.
E: then, noticing
C: LISA
D: Oh, that was a long time ago. You must have been a teenager.
C: DANNY
D: Oh, I was a teenager. The way you pounded that veal...
E: with meaning
N: As Lisa GIGGLES girlishly, Teddy looks to camera, pained.
C: JARED
D: Okay, Freebies, trademark pending, How do we make our new members feel welcome? We share our journeys. Cooper, how about you start?
C: COOPER
D: Okay. My journey.
E: rising
C: LISA
D: So cute. And nice. Maybe he’s single.
E: to Teddy
C: COOPER
D: I’m here because my fiancee signed me up.
C: LISA
D: Maybe he has a brother.
E: to Teddy
N: Teddy looks to the camera for help.
C: COOPER
D: She bought me a size thirty-two wedding tuxedo. What grown man has a thirty-two inch waist?
C: JARED
D: Mine’s thirty.
C: COOPER
D: Asked and answered.
N: Cooper sits. Nicole rises.
C: NICOLE
D: I’ll go next. Nicole. Divorce lawyer. As many of you know, I wanna be thicc, but like with two c’s, not three. I just feel healthier when I’m under two hundred.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: Sorry, just never heard that as a goal weight before, so...
E: gasps, then
C: LINUS
D: Babe, this is why people don’t like you.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: People don’t like me?
E: baffled
C: JARED
D: Look, this is a safe space where you say anything you want, but you can’t say anything you want.
C: COOPER TEDDY
D: Confusing. Confusing.
E: to camera
N: Surprised by their like-mindedness, Teddy looks at Cooper with interest.
C: JARED
D: Wednesday, how about you go next?
C: WEDNESDAY
D: Hi. Wednesday. I joined the group because A. It’s exactly ten thousand steps from my house so I know I’ll get in double steps that day and B. I really want to stop obsessing about things like steps. I have been diagnosed with Orthorexia Nervosa which is a compulsive preoccupation with pure foods - a real thing, so... but I think it might be driving my husband crazy. Not that he doesn’t love me. I know he’s proud to have me on his arm. And if that makes me a trophy wife, is that such a bad thing?
E: rising, waves
C: LISA
D: Always wanted to be a trophy wife.
E: to self
C: TEDDY
D: My role model.
E: to camera
C: WEDNESDAY
D: I mean, don’t we like trophies? How come we’re supposed to respect sex workers but not trophy wives? Thank you.
E: then, slight curtsy
C: LINUS
D: I will go next. Linus. I spent my childhood being sent to either pray the weight away or pray the gay away camps and I just came back bigger and gayer. Anyway, calendar pages...
E: rising making time-passing motion with hand MORE
C: LINUS
D: Today. Recently went through a breakup with the love of my life. I got played harder than ‘Uptown Funk’ in 2015. And now I’m here because I want to be the heartbreaker. Payback is a bitch and she is a skinny bitch.
E: CONT'D
N: Lisa claps, then notices she’s the only one.
C: LISA
D: Oh, was I not supposed to clap that? I just relate. I’ve been trying to lose weight for decades to get back at my ex.
C: TEDDY
D: That’s been fun.
E: to camera
C: LISA
D: Okay if I talk?
E: to Jared
C: JARED DANNY
D: Of course. Please.
C: LISA
D: Well, I’m Lisa. And I’m here because I really want this to work. And I do want to be more positive. But the truth is, I’ve lost and gained the same thirty pounds for thirty years and now, at my age, even if I do lose it for good my skin will just hang. Honestly I probably look better naked like this, but in order to attract a man to see me naked I’ve got to look better in clothes. And don’t say “work out” because that doesn’t lift skin so, what, now I’m supposed to eat right and work out so I can feel better but not look better? That’s some fucked up bullshit right there! But I am trying to be more positive.
E: then, sweetly
C: JARED
D: Awesome share, Lisa. And how about you, Teddy? What can The Free Method free you from? Trademarked.
C: TEDDY
D: That’s okay, I’m just here for my mom.
C: JARED
D: But you’re signed up for the next six months.
C: TEDDY
D: Wait... what?
C: LISA
D: It’s a gift.
C: TEDDY
D: But I don’t want it. Or need it. I’m good. I’m happy.
E: to group
C: LISA
D: Well, that’s what she says.
C: TEDDY
D: I say it because it’s true.
C: LISA
D: She dates men who are all wrong for her, she sneaks food at night. And I know because when I go to sneak it? Gone.
C: TEDDY
D: Mom, that’s enough.
C: LISA
D: Sometimes I hear her crying--
C: TEDDY
D: Mom, please stop talking.
C: LISA
D: Maybe you can get her to open up.
E: to group
N: The others AD-LIB encouragement: “This is a safe space.”, “Let it out.”, “I just spilled my guts.” etc.
C: TEDDY
D: What does she want me to say?
E: frustrated, to camera MORE
C: TEDDY
D: I like food so I eat it and then I get sad that I ate it and then I eat ‘cause I’m sad and then the whole thing starts all over again and I’m filled with so much shame and self-loathing I can’t stand it? I’m good, y’all. And all this sharing stuff? Not for me. And honestly, don’t think it works. It certainly has not worked for my mom.
E: CONT'D then, to group, upbeat
C: LISA
D: But this one’s different.
C: TEDDY
D: They’re all different. I can’t even count the number of groups and programs you’ve joined that you thought were the one.
E: to camera
C: Twenty-two. I counted.
D: So... just gonna leave. Very big night tonight. But not gonna share why.
E: then, to group
N: As Teddy walks away Wednesday gets a text: “Late night, don’t wait up.” We see from the background photo that Wednesday’s husband is Teddy’s boyfriend James. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO
S: INT. APARTMENT - WORKROOM - LATER THAT DAY
N: Close on Teddy’s hands stacking pancakes on a plate with cardboard in between as she practices her proposal.
C: TEDDY
D: Will you marry me?... Mar-ry... Marr-ee... Ma-ree... Do I not know how to talk?
E: O.C.
N: As she puts plastic butter on top and blasts it with a torch:
C: TEDDY
D: It’s for a Denny’s menu.
E: CONT'D to camera
N: She quickly adds berries then douses it with brown lubricant.
C: TEDDY
D: Motor oil. Doesn’t absorb into the pancakes. Yeah, still wanna eat it.
E: CONT'D re: beautiful stack
N: As she snaps some photos:
C: TEDDY
D: She signed me up. How can I even think about proposing when I’m so mad at her? No boundaries... When is it going to end with her? I guess it doesn’t end until I make it end. And I need to do it in time for us to watch next week’s Survivor together.
E: CONT'D sighs
S: INT. APARTMENT - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
N: Teddy walks down the stairs that connect the apartment to the restaurant kitchen and finds Lisa opening a bottle of wine.
C: TEDDY
D: So you got home okay.
C: LISA
D: Yes. And the Uber driver agrees that you were very mean to me.
C: TEDDY
D: He spoke English?
C: LISA
D: Not really. You should have stayed. It’s such an interesting group--
C: TEDDY
D: I do not want to hear about the group, or know about the group, I never want to see them again. In fact--
N: SFX: Laughter from the restaurant.
C: TEDDY
D: Who’s here?
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: Keep an open mind.
N: Lisa takes the wine into the restaurant. Teddy follows...
S: INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
N: ...to find Cooper, Wednesday, Linus and Danny eating pizza and drinking wine. Linus spots Teddy.
C: LINUS
D: Hey, you.
C: LISA
D: I opened up the restaurant early for them. Everyone was peckish after the meeting - you know how it is, all that talk about conscious eating makes you famished.
C: TEDDY
D: How could I not be fucked up about food?
E: to camera
C: LINUS
D: We’re in the middle of a hot debate over best afterschool snack. For me, the combo of Doritos 3D, Vanilla Coke and a Disney Channel original movie has yet to be surpassed.
C: DANNY
D: Dunkaroos. When you’d finish the cookies and then scoop the last bit of frosting out with your finger? Chef’s kiss.
N: They all SIGH, lost in the memory.
C: LINUS
D: We have a winner.
C: LISA
D: C’mon Teddy, join us.
C: TEDDY
D: I’m in the middle of some work.
C: LISA
D: Teddy is a very talented food stylist. Those deli sandwiches in Mrs. Maisel? All her.
N: Everyone reacts: “That’s you?!”, “Major.” They applaud.
C: TEDDY
D: Wow, thanks. Well, gotta get back.
C: NICOLE
D: That’s right, you’ve got that “mysterious big night.”
N: They AD-LIB goodbyes as Teddy heads out but she hangs behind the kitchen door to overhear:
C: LINUS
D: Okay, new category: Best Chain Restaurant Free Bread. Go.
C: COOPER
D: Don’t jump down my throat, but my choice is Olive Garden’s bread sticks.
N: Angle on: Teddy, listening, amused as they pounce: “You’re delusional.”, “That shit is nasty.”
C: NICOLE
D: Who hurt you?
C: COOPER
D: Hey!
C: LINUS
D: I’m sorry, Cooper, but is our outrage on Timothy Olyphant’s IMDB page? Because it is justified.
C: NICOLE
D: The only way an Olive Garden bread stick is getting inside of me is if I’m too lazy to get my dildo. Look at him.
E: off Cooper’s reaction
C: COOPER
D: I’m sorry, I didn’t grow up with sisters.
N: Angle on: Teddy stifling a giggle.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: I’m finding all this talk about bread triggering.
C: NICOLE
D: You know what I find triggering? People who say “triggering.” Me? I like a Texas Roadhouse roll.
C: LINUS
D: Nah you don’t. You like the cinnamon butter it comes with. I’d eat my arm if that was on it.
C: DANNY
D: Cracker Barrel’s got a good basket. Cornbread and biscuits. It’s an older crowd, but I don’t mind feeling young and sexy. And I like waiting in a rocking chair.
C: LINUS
D: Yes. But. There can only be one best and that is... Cheesecake Factory’s Brown Bread. End of discussion. Fight me.
N: Everyone AD-LIBS agreement: “Doughy.”, “Sweet.”, “Like eating a hug.” Teddy listens, then can’t resist and storms back.
C: TEDDY
D: What is wrong with all y’all? It’s Red Lobster’s Cheddar Bay Biscuits! Made from scratch, brushed with scampi butter.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh-kay now we talking. That shit is legit delicious.
C: DANNY
D: Cheese. Bread. Butter. Amen.
E: sign of the cross
C: LINUS
D: The winner.
E: indicating Teddy
C: LISA
D: More wine anyone?
C: LINUS
D: Sure, I’m currently without employment.
C: COOPER
D: And I’m off duty. I’m a cop.
E: to Teddy
C: TEDDY
D: You’re a cop?
C: COOPER
D: I wish once someone wouldn’t say it that way. Just... “Oh, you’re a cop.” Not “You’re a cop?” I work for the Jumper Squad. Talk people off ledges, bridges.
E: casually
C: TEDDY
D: Wow. How do you keep them from...
C: COOPER
D: Believe it or not, sometimes pizza. Even people on ledges hesitate if you offer them a slice. It’s all about keeping them talking, finding that moment when they seem open to help. We call it “The Grab.”
C: DANNY
D: Keeping people alive, dude. That’s taking money out of my pocket.
C: LINUS
D: And it makes me want another slice.
E: then MORE
C: LINUS
D: And now I hear Jared’s voice saying I’m just justifying and excusing. Screw it, I’ll just move to the south where I’ll be thin.
E: CONT'D then
C: NICOLE
D: But then you’re a gay man in the south.
C: LINUS
D: Oy. Sometimes I think we need to Marie Condo this country. Does West Virginia really spark joy?
C: TEDDY
D: Hey guys, sorry for earlier on the mountain. Just not big on the whole sharing personal stuff thing.
E: laughs, then
C: LISA
D: Something the group could really help you with.
E: under breath
C: TEDDY
D: Mom...
E: under breath
N: Lisa mimes zipping her lip and throwing away the key.
C: TEDDY
D: She always finds that key. Will you apologize to Jared for me?
E: CONT'D to camera then, to group
C: NICOLE
D: Oh, he’s not mad, he asked us to get your number.
C: TEDDY
D: He did? But you told him I was with someone, right?
E: flattered then, to Lisa
C: LISA
D: I did, but the group discussed it and we decided you could do better.
C: TEDDY
D: What?
C: NICOLE
D: Unless, how good is the dick? Hard to break up with good dick. Even if he’s married.
N: Cooper makes a face.
C: TEDDY
D: You told them that?
E: to Lisa
C: LISA
D: We have no secrets.
E: re: group
C: TEDDY
D: You met them. Today.
E: seething
C: COOPER
D: Uh... Maybe we should give you guys your space.
N: The others rise, AD-LIB: “Yeah.”, “Thanks for the food.”, “See you later.” After they exit:
C: LISA
D: Look, honey, I know you’re mad. But we’re all just trying to help.
C: TEDDY
D: Trying to help, trying to help. Okay, we’ve danced around this too long. For once, Mom. Listen to me. I don’t need or want help. From you. Or anyone else.
C: LISA
D: What groups like this give me--
C: TEDDY
D: Stop! I don’t want to be like you. Spending my whole life trying to fix myself, trying to achieve some impossible ideal that’s not me and putting my life on hold until I do. I don’t need to fix myself. I’m not broken.
N: She turns to exit.
C: LISA
D: Wait... I know I’m a blabbermouth and I’m sorry I’m such a bad role model and I passed my messed up stuff on to you... You say you don’t need any help, but when you keep everything inside, tamping it down, it comes out in other ways... like dating men who aren’t available. Men who put you down, make you feel bad about yourself. Ask yourself, why do you put up with that? I’m not saying you’re broken, but that’s what you’ve got to fix. And if you really don’t want to be like me, don’t marry a man who is less than you deserve.
N: This sinks in but Teddy resists.
C: TEDDY
D: You’re wrong about James. He’s not Daddy. And next time you see me? I’m going to be engaged. I hope you can be happy for me.
N: Teddy exits.
S: INT. TEDDY & LISA'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY
N: Teddy, looking fabulous, finishes lighting romantic candles. We hear a KNOCK on the door. She takes a big breath, then:
C: TEDDY
D: It’s open.
N: James enters with flowers and a bottle of wine.
C: JAMES
D: Happy anniversary, baby.
C: TEDDY
D: Every time he enters a room I feel like I’m on The Bachelor. Happy anniversary.
E: to camera, excited then
N: They kiss. James hugs her tight.
C: JAMES
D: One more sec. Did three breast augmentations today and it’s nice to feel the real thing. Wow, you look fantastic. Only... Posture. We’ve talked about this - your career would be further along if your posture exuded confidence.
E: then touches her back
C: TEDDY
D: You’re right, sorry. Trying.
C: JAMES
D: Trying allows for failure, just commit.
C: TEDDY
D: Well, speaking of committing... I was going to wait til later but I’m seriously about to burst. I know the divorce isn’t final yet-- Shitty start for a proposal, it’ll get better.
E: taking his hands to camera
C: JAMES
D: Actually, baby, the divorce. Gonna take a bit longer than we hoped.
C: TEDDY
D: What? Why? James, I don’t want be in the shadows anymore. I hate that you’re married.
C: JAMES
D: I hate it, too. I love you, I want to be with you. It’s just timing. She’s under a lot of stress.
C: TEDDY
D: Oh, who isn’t under a lot of stress?!
C: JAMES
D: Okay, dial it down. You’re doing that thing where you let your insecurities run the show and your voice gets shrill.
C: TEDDY
D: Why do I put up with that? Why do I put up with that?
E: to camera then, to James
C: JAMES
D: What are you talking about? I don’t have the bandwidth for a Teddy tantrum right now.
C: TEDDY
D: Oh my god, is my mother actually right? Fuck. I’m talking about the way you treat me, the constant digs, corrections. It’s not right. I deserve better.
E: to camera to James to camera, unsure
C: Don’t I?
D: Before they can get into it, we hear a DOORBELL. Teddy crosses and opens the door to find Wednesday, Linus, Nicole and Danny. Linus’ face is covered in red marks.
C: TEDDY
D: What are you doing here? Do you travel in a pack?
E: CONT'D
C: LINUS
D: More of a tribe, but sure. Microneedling. In a week I’ll have skin like the Hollywood filter. Not that I know what that is.
E: re: face
C: TEDDY
D: No Cooper?
E: looking
C: DANNY
D: He didn’t think this was any of our business.
C: TEDDY
D: It isn’t!
C: LINUS
D: Yeah, but if we don’t obsess about other people’s problems we’ll have to think about our own, so...
C: NICOLE
D: The thing is, after we left earlier we felt bad that you were upset with your mom because we agreed with her that you could do better, but then we realized people always tell people they could do better because that’s what they want to hear, but is that really honest?
C: WEDNESDAY
D: Yes, your guy’s married, but he’s handsome and successful and judging from the sounds your mother hears through the walls, good in bed...
C: TEDDY
D: Wait. So y’all are here to tell me I can’t do better?
C: DANNY
D: No, you so can! But we’re also saying... can you?
C: NICOLE
D: None of us is nineteen anymore.
C: TEDDY
D: I’m twenty-eight.
C: LINUS
D: Not nineteen.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: Cute story. When I met my husband-- James?
E: spots something
C: TEDDY
D: You know him?
C: WEDNESDAY
D: He’s my husband.
N: END OF ACT TWO ACT THREE
S: INT. TEDDY & LISA’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: As before. As they cross into the living room:
C: TEDDY
D: What do you mean he’s your husband?
C: WEDNESDAY
D: What else could I mean? James, what are you doing here?
C: TEDDY
D: I knew his wife would be skinny. Yes, I go there right now.
E: to camera
C: JAMES
D: Wednesday, I can--
C: TEDDY
D: Wait, you said your wife’s name was Dorothy.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: Dorothy? That’s an old lady’s name.
C: JAMES
D: It’s not your name.
C: NICOLE
D: How did you not know she was his wife? Didn’t you cyberstalk?
E: to Teddy
C: TEDDY
D: He’s not on any social media.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: It’s something I always admired about him.
C: TEDDY
D: Me, too.
E: momentary bond
C: DANNY
D: This is getting a little weird.
E: sotto
C: LINUS
D: I’m in heaven.
E: sotto
C: JAMES
D: Who are these people?
C: WEDNESDAY
D: They’re part of this food group I go to. She’s in it too.
E: re: Teddy
C: TEDDY
D: I went once.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: How long has this been going on?
C: JAMES TEDDY
D: Not long at all. Two years. Today.
C: LINUS
D: Woof. You poor thing-- -ngs.
E: to Wednesday adding Teddy
C: WEDNESDAY
D: But we were trying to have a baby.
C: TEDDY
D: What? You’re in the middle of a divorce!
C: WEDNESDAY
D: What divorce?
C: TEDDY
D: There’s no divorce?!
C: LISA
D: What is going--
E: O.C.
N: She enters, takes in the scene, and GASPS.
C: LISA
D: What’d I miss?
E: CONT'D
C: TEDDY
D: I just found out James is Wednesday’s husband.
C: LISA
D: I knew it!
C: TEDDY
D: No, you didn’t.
N: SFX: Timer. Lisa reaches into her pocket and shuts it off.
C: LISA
D: Shoot. Something in the oven. Not a word til I get back.
C: TEDDY
D: Mom, we’re not going to do that.
C: LISA
D: Then come to the kitchen with me.
C: DANNY
D: It sure smells good.
S: INT. APARTMENT - STAIRS/INT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN
N: As they head down the stairs:
C: TEDDY
D: Look, Wednesday, you have every reason to hate me. But I didn’t know he was your husband.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: You knew he was somebody’s husband.
C: TEDDY
D: Fair point.
E: to camera
N: They arrive in the kitchen. Lisa crosses to the stove and takes chocolate lava cakes out of the oven.
C: NICOLE
D: Don’t you just love a restaurant kitchen?
E: sotto to Linus and Danny
C: LINUS
D: More than life itself. Got to explore.
N: As Linus, Nicole and Danny explore:
C: JAMES
D: Look, I know I fucked up. But it’s over. I came here to end things.
E: to Wednesday
C: TEDDY
D: What?!
C: WEDNESDAY
D: Really? Is that true?
C: LINUS
D: Oh, babe, look at him. I’m sorry, are you a pie made by angry housekeepers? Because you are full of shit.
E: to Wednesday to James
C: TEDDY
D: You weren’t breaking up with me. But I was just about to break up with you.
C: LISA
D: Oh honey, I’m so proud of you! Was it because of what I said?
C: TEDDY
D: Yes.
E: grudgingly
C: WEDNESDAY
D: Oh my god, can we not make this not about me right now?
C: TEDDY
D: I’m sorry, just give us a minute.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: Okay. See? I’m nice.
C: TEDDY
D: I do date men who make me feel bad about myself. And I need to look at that. You were right.
E: to Lisa
C: LISA
D: You were right about me, too. I’ve wasted so much of my life being unhappy with myself.
E: to Teddy MORE
C: LISA
D: There was no “body acceptance” when I was growing up. That’s like a foreign language to me.
E: CONT'D
C: TEDDY
D: Well, I may want it, but I’m not there yet, either. And at least you’re honest about your struggles. I hide what I’m going through with eating... and everything else.
C: LISA
D: Oh, honey. I’ll do better.
C: TEDDY
D: Me, too. And thank you. I do think I could use some help. Thought I didn’t. Thought I was different.
C: NICOLE
D: Thinking you’re different is what’ll kill you.
C: LINUS
D: And, babe, there’s no one in a food issues group who doesn’t know about hiding things. We hide what we eat, we hide when we eat, we hide from mirrors and scales. It’s all shame and guilt and things we’re afraid to say out loud like... This isn’t microneedling! I’ve been stalking my ex for weeks and today I saw him with another man and I jumped into a bush.
E: re: face
C: NICOLE
D: I hide stuff, too. Like most of the time I love myself, but there’s times I take my clothes off and just effing hate myself.
C: DANNY
D: I’m scared I’m gonna die.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: I weigh a hundred and twelve!
C: NICOLE
D: That’s your big dark secret?
C: WEDNESDAY
D: I tell everyone I weigh a hundred and eight. That’s a big confession. Why can’t anyone be supportive of me?
C: NICOLE
D: Girl, you don’t make it easy.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: I spend every second of every day trying to be perfect. And my husband still cheats on me. Why was I trying so hard to be perfect for you?
E: to James
C: TEDDY
D: Why did I think you were making me better?
C: WEDNESDAY
D: Oh, it’s not even about him. It’s about needing to believe like he was the thing, the handsome prince, the one everyone wants. Like... if I can get him to love me maybe I’m not as unlovable as I think I am. It’s all just... feeling like you’re not enough, you know?
E: tearing up
N: This strikes a chord in the group. Everyone gets emotional.
C: TEDDY
D: Yeah, I do know.
E: tearing up
C: NICOLE
D: Me, too.
C: LINUS
D: All the time.
C: LISA
D: My whole life.
C: DANNY
D: Food makes it better.
C: TEDDY
D: For a minute. But then... it’s all connected y’know? I think I... No, I don’t want to get into...
N: The other’s AD-LIB: “Let it out.”, “It’s OK.”, “We’re here.”
C: TEDDY
D: I think I... date men who make me feel bad about myself because... it’s what I know. It validates what I’m already feeling. And then when it ends, there’s food. Food will always be there, food will never leave me.
E: CONT'D
N: Lisa hugs Teddy as everyone wipes away tears.
C: TEDDY
D: Is there actually anyone who likes themselves?
E: CONT'D
C: JAMES
D: I do.
E: sincerely
N: The others AD-LIB: “Shut up.”, “Unbelievable.”, “Jerk.”
C: LINUS
D: Jealous.
C: JAMES
D: Look, nothing I say right now is gonna be right. There’s no me coming off well here, I know that. But I honestly did and do love both of you.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: It’s over, James.
N: He nods and then gives the slightest of glances toward Teddy.
C: TEDDY
D: Obviously with me, too.
C: NICOLE
D: Every marriage ending is a tragedy. Which one of you wants my card?
E: whips out
N: Wednesday snaps it up.
C: JAMES
D: I’m sorry. I’m truly, truly sorry.
E: to Teddy and Wednesday
N: He exits. They all watch him go.
C: LINUS
D: Okay, I’ll say it. Nice ass. But not nice enough to justify what he put you two through.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: I’m not going to be married. All my life all I wanted to be is married. And now I won’t be.
N: Without thinking, she picks up one of the lava cakes and takes a bite. Her eyes roll back into her head.
C: WEDNESDAY
D: Oh. My. God. I haven’t had sugar in five years. So good. So good.
E: CONT'D
N: The others watch wide-eyed as she downs it like an animal.
C: LINUS
D: Played out, but I’ll have what she’s having.
C: TEDDY
D: I think I need some air.
N: As Teddy exits, Lisa stops her.
C: LISA
D: We’re good, right?
C: TEDDY
D: Yeah.
C: LISA
D: One thing I know is that you won’t pass this stuff on to your kid.
C: TEDDY
D: No, I won’t. Thanks.
N: Teddy heads out.
C: LISA
D: It’s not easy!
E: calling after
N: Teddy glances at the camera as she exits.
S: EXT. APARTMENT - ALLEYWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Teddy steps outside. Cooper, planting flowers in the alleyway, turns. They look at each other.
C: COOPER
D: Is it too late to pretend you didn’t see me?
C: TEDDY A hundred percent. COOPER
D: I know this looks weird. I usually do it at night. Just made it weirder. Any chance you’ve heard of Guerrilla Gardening? Basically it’s illegally planting stuff on public property. It’s my way of sticking it to the man.
E: off her puzzled look
C: TEDDY
D: But aren’t you the man?
C: COOPER
D: Yeah, I guess I just like flowers. When I left earlier I noticed this area could use something lively. Sort of like when you showed up at the group. Any chance you might come back? Some of it’s BS, but you might get something out of it. Or realize you’re great the way you are.
E: then shyly
C: TEDDY
D: Was that “The Grab”?
E: beat
C: COOPER
D: Maybe.
C: TEDDY
D: Y’all are an interesting bunch.
C: COOPER
D: Is there a story behind the “y’all”?
C: TEDDY
D: Yes, but it’s a long one. And I don’t think Wednesday will want me in the group. Turns out I’ve been sleeping with her husband.
C: COOPER
D: Wow. Well, maybe the two of you can help each other through that.
C: TEDDY
D: You’re so nice.
C: COOPER
D: Too nice?
C: TEDDY
D: Maybe.
N: They share a look. It is indeed a moment.
C: TEDDY
D: Am I actually attracted to a nice guy? Maybe I don’t need help.
E: CONT'D to camera
N: SFX: Text on Cooper’s phone.
C: COOPER
D: My fiance.
E: looks
C: TEDDY
D: There it is.
E: to camera
C: JARED
D: Dudes!
E: O.C.
N: Jared strolls up holding a bottle.
C: JARED
D: Your mom said I should stop by sometime. Vodka. No carbs.
E: CONT'D holds up bottle
C: COOPER
D: You go ahead. Anyway... see you next week?
E: starts to text, then, to Teddy
C: TEDDY
D: Yeah, I’ll be there.
N: END OF SHOW
