D:              I have been diagnosed with

D:              husband crazy. Not that he doesn’t
D:              love me. I know he’s proud to have
D:              me on his arm. And if that makes
D:              me a trophy wife, is that such a

D:             Look, nothing I say right now is
D:             gonna be right. There’s no me
D:             coming off well here, I know that.
D:             But I honestly did and do love both
D:             of you.

0: 
C:                       TEDDY
D:             Obviously with me, too.

D:             Every marriage ending is a tragedy.
E:                 (whips out)
D:             Which one of you wants my card?
0: 
N: Wednesday snaps it up.

D:           Okay, I’ll say it. Nice ass. But
D:           not nice enough to justify what he
D:           put you two through.
0: 
C:                     WEDNESDAY
D:           I’m not going to be married. All
D:           my life all I wanted to be is
D:           married. And now I won’t be.
0: 
N: Without thinking, she picks up one of the lava cakes and
N: takes a bite. Her eyes roll back into her head.
0: 
C:                     WEDNESDAY (CONT'D)
D:           Oh. My. God. I haven’t had sugar
D:           in five years. So good. So good.
0: 
N: The others watch wide-eyed as she downs it like an animal.
0: 
C:                     LINUS
D:           Played out, but I’ll have what
D:           she’s having.
0: 
C:                     TEDDY
D:           I think I need some air.
0: 
N: As Teddy exits, Lisa stops her.
0: 
C:                     LISA
D:           We’re good, right?
0: 
C:                     TEDDY
D:           Yeah.
0: 
C:                     LISA
D:           One thing I know is that you won’t
D:           pass this stuff on to your kid.
0: 
C:                     TEDDY
D:           No, I won’t. Thanks.

N: Teddy steps outside. Cooper, planting flowers in the

C:           COOPER
D: Is it too late to pretend you
D: didn’t see me?
0: 
C:           TEDDY
C: A hundred percent.
C:           COOPER
D: I know this looks weird. I usually
D: do it at night. Just made it
D: weirder. Any chance you’ve heard
D: of Guerrilla Gardening?
E:     (off her puzzled look)
D: Basically it’s illegally planting
D: stuff on public property. It’s my
D: way of sticking it to the man.
C:           TEDDY
D: But aren’t you the man?
C:             COOPER
D: Yeah, I guess I just like flowers.
E:      (then)
D: When I left earlier I noticed this
D: area could use something lively.
E:      (shyly)
D: Sort of like when you showed up at
D: the group. Any chance you might
D: come back? Some of it’s BS, but
D: you might get something out of it.
D: Or realize you’re great the way you
D: are.
0: 
C:            TEDDY
E:     (beat)
D: Was that “The Grab”?
0: 
C:           COOPER
D: Maybe.
0: 
C:           TEDDY
D: Y’all are an interesting bunch.
0: 
C:           COOPER
D: Is there a story behind the
D: “y’all”?
0: 
C:           TEDDY
D: Yes, but it’s a long one. And I
D: don’t think Wednesday will want me
D: in the group. Turns out I’ve been
D: sleeping with her husband.

D:           Wow. Well, maybe the two of you
D:           can help each other through that.
0: 
C:                     TEDDY
D:           You’re so nice.

E:               (to camera)
D:           Am I actually attracted to a nice
D:           guy? Maybe I don’t need help.

N: SFX: Text on Cooper’s phone.
