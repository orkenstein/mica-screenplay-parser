S: INT. BEDROOM - 1994 - MORNING
N: A 7-year-old boy, GREG YOUNG, pops out of bed, excited. He runs to his desk, grabs a pencil, then marks his height on the wall. He hears some LOUD NOISES down the hall. Curious, he creeps towards the door when suddenly, his 10 year old sister, JUNE, BURSTS into his room and shuts the door with urgency!
C: GREG
D: What are you doing?
C: JUNE
D: You have to listen to me. This is serious. I’m only telling you this because you’re seven now and you’re old enough to know the truth.
C: GREG
D: Okay...
C: JUNE
D: That’s not what you think it is.
E: pointing
C: GREG
D: My toy chest?
C: JUNE
D: It’s actually... a portal.
C: GREG
D: Pfft. No way. To where?
E: then; curious
N: June starts dumping all the toys out of the chest.
C: JUNE
D: I’ve only used it once and it took me to the North Pole. Maybe it goes other places too - I only know for sure it goes there.
N: Greg stares at the toy chest, his heart pounding. Then he runs to his CLOSET.
C: JUNE
D: What are you doing?
E: CONT’D
N: Greg pulls out a WINTER COAT.
C: GREG
D: It’s the North Pole.
C: JUNE
D: Duh! Wish I had thought of that when I went. Now hurry!
N: Greg quickly climbs into the toy chest.
C: JUNE
D: Okay. When I close this, you need to count to five but most importantly, you need to believe.
E: CONT’D
N: Greg nods and June closes the toy chest. WE STAY IN GREG’S POV INSIDE THE DARK AND CONFINING TOY CHEST.
C: GREG
D: Nothing’s happening! I’m just getting hot.
C: JUNE
D: Weird! Maybe try to believe more!
E: O.S.
N: Greg tries again. Nothing. Frustrated, he tries to push open the toy chest only to realize he’s locked in. He starts POUNDING to get out but it’s no use. He panics.
C: GREG
D: JUNE! LET ME OUT! JUNE!
N: Then the Offspring’s “Keep Em Separated” starts BLARING AT FULL BLAST. It’s torture. Greg bangs on the lid like he’s trying to get out of a coffin. His SCREAMS MORPH into the SCREAM OF AN ADULT-
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
N: GREG (now in his 30s) wakes up SCREAMING, in a cold sweat. His wife NICOLE (30s), who is sleeping face-to-face with him, is startled awake and screams right in his face:
C: NICOLE
D: AHHHHH!! Seriously?! Again?
C: GREG
D: Sorry. I can’t control my mind when I sleep. I’m not Freddy Krueger.
C: NICOLE
D: Freddy controlled other people’s minds when they slept, not his own. I don’t even think he slept.
N: 3:02am. They both groan, trying to get back to sleep. Then-
C: AARON
D: I’m wet.
E: O.S.
C: GREG/NICOLE
D: AHHHHH!!
N: Their 4-year-old AARON is standing at the foot of their bed, horror-movie style. Nicole rolls over.
C: NICOLE
D: I did it last time.
N: Greg GROANS and gets up.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BOYS’ BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Greg, half-asleep, strips the sheets, and flips the mattress - - there are pee stains everywhere.
C: GREG
D: This mattress looks like a giraffe’s neck.
C: AARON
D: Can we go to the zoo tomorrow?
C: GREG
D: No. Go back to sleep.
E: tucking Aaron in
C: AARON
D: I’m thirsty.
C: GREG
D: That’s how we got into this mess in the first place. Love you.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER
N: It’s 4:01am. Greg and Nicole are fast asleep again.
C: ANDREW
D: I had a bad dream.
E: O.S.
N: Their other son, ANDREW (5) is now standing by their bed.
C: ANDREW
D: Can I sleep with you?
E: CONT’D
N: Andrew climbs in bed and clings onto his mom.
C: NICOLE
D: Can you move over a bit? And maybe loosen the choke-hold?
C: ANDREW
D: No. The Chupacabra will eat my feet.
N: Andrew gets in a position where he’s splayed across the bed, clinging to Nicole with his feet kicking Greg’s back. Neither of them will be sleeping tonight.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - MORNING
N: The house is a mess. Chipped paint and magic markers on walls, scratches on floors, toys everywhere. Greg and Nicole look utterly exhausted as they prepare breakfast, clean-up after the boys, fold laundry, etc. Once the plates are on the table, Greg sits down to review PAPERWORK.
C: ANDREW
D: 3-2-1! THE FLOOR IS LAVA!
N: Andrew and Aaron dive onto the couch and climb on furniture, knocking over Nicole’s neat laundry piles.
C: NICOLE
D: Awww come on, man. My piles.
C: AARON
D: The floor was lava.
C: NICOLE
D: Greg, you want to attempt to be useful here?
C: GREG
D: Boys. Food’s on the table. Eat.
N: The boys ignore him and continue playing. Greg looks at her - he tried.
C: NICOLE
D: Okay, you have 5 seconds to get to the table or you never get to eat breakfast again.
C: ANDREW
D: Race you to the table!
N: The boys race to the table and knock over a cup of milk. Some of it SPILLS on Greg’s paperwork. He quickly grabs them.
C: GREG
D: NO! My inspection report- Do you see what you did?!
C: ANDREW
D: Yeah.
C: GREG
D: Do you even care?!
N: They don’t. Frustrated, Greg pins the dripping papers up on the fridge with an OLD FRIDGE MAGNET (that features a much younger Greg and Nicole as real estate partners).
C: AARON
D: Mom. Can I have more milk?
C: NICOLE
D: There isn’t any more.
C: AARON
D: BUT I WANT MILK!
N: Nicole sees Aaron is on the brink of tears and enthusiastically tries a different tact.
C: NICOLE
D: Boys! This is math! Aaron had 1 milk, then he lost 1 milk, so now there’s 0 milk. But what if Aaron had 2 milks, and then spilled just 1 of them? Then how many milks would Aaron have left?
C: AARON
D: I waaaaaant miiiiiilk!
E: bursting out in tears
C: NICOLE
D: Ugh. We really need to get these guys into pre-school. They’re not learning anything here.
C: GREG
D: Do you not see me working on it?
C: NICOLE
D: I didn’t mean it like that.
N: This is a touchy subject. The moment is interrupted by Andrew teasing Aaron which then escalates to PUSHING AND FIGHTING.
C: GREG
D: No closed fists! Slappers only!
N: They roll on the ground, wrestling.
C: NICOLE
D: Guys! GUYS! If you’re gonna roll on the floor at least roll over the milk and help me out.
C: ANDREW
D: Ahhhhh! Aaron bit me!
C: NICOLE
D: STOP FIGHTING EACH OTHER! WHY WON’T YOU JUST LISTEN?!
N: Both boys cry harder after being yelled at. At the peak of the stress level, Greg announces:
C: GREG
D: You know what, I’m gonna print these at the office. See you tonight. Love you!
N: Greg’s out the door before Nicole can even respond. Numb to the boys’ crying, she starts cleaning up the spill.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
N: JUNE OLSEN (40s, Greg’s sister from the flashback) lays in bed, staring up at the ceiling. She looks troubled. Her husband RANDALL (40s) sleeps beside her. She gets up.
S: INT. OLSENS HOUSE - GARAGE/ART STUDIO - SOON AFTER
N: June paints on a canvass, now looking calmer and more relaxed, as if this was a form of therapy.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MORNING
N: June and Randall sit across from each other at the breakfast table, reading the newspaper, not engaging in conversation. Their son, MARTY (11) joins them.
C: MARTY
D: Oh. They evacuated Ventura County. Wildfires are getting closer.
N: June and Randall look at each other, confused, then realize Marty read the headline from the back of the newspaper he’s holding. Randall folds the paper and tucks it away.
C: RANDALL
D: It’s okay. We’re nowhere near a burn zone. We won’t be affected.
C: MARTY
D: We’re affected by the air quality.
C: JUNE
D: You don’t have to worry about stuff like air, honey. You’re young and healthy.
C: MARTY
D: What about the two of you though?
C: JUNE
D: We’re fine. We’re healthy as horses.
C: MARTY
D: Horses die all the time. At Santa Anita race track it’s happening in record numbers.
C: RANDALL
D: Fine. We’re healthier than horses. Hey, how about you go play some video games, huh?
C: MARTY
D: Really? Before school?
C: RANDALL
D: Sure! Why not? So much for reading newspapers around him.
E: Marty leaves
N: Their 13-year-old daughter AMY walks in and starts making a smoothie, not acknowledging either of her parents.
C: JUNE RANDALL
D: Morning Amy. Morning honey.
E: CONT'D
N: No response. They look at each other, give a wink and a nod.
C: RANDALL
D: Hey, uh, Amy...
E: CONT’D
N: Amy rolls her eyes, as if even the sound of their voices makes her nauseous.
C: RANDALL
D: ...you might wanna check your bag there. I think there’s something sticking out of it.
E: CONT’D
C: AMY
D: Were you going through my things?
C: JUNE
D: Just look at the bag.
N: Amy pulls out the 4 TICKETS from her bag.
C: AMY
D: Disneyland?
C: RANDALL
D: We thought it’d be fun for all of us to go for your birthday! Happiest place on earth!
C: AMY
D: Yeah, for kids. I want to go to Coachella for my birthday.
C: RANDALL
D: Coachella. I guess we could rent an RV and go camping in Joshua tree-
C: AMY
D: Not with you. With my friends. Jasmine’s Dad is a concert promoter, he can get us VIP passes.
C: JUNE
D: Oh great. Jasmine’s dad. The guy who bought his daughter a vape pen for Christmas?
C: RANDALL
D: I guess getting your daughter cool things but never actually being around makes you father-of-the-year now?
C: AMY
D: Yes.
N: Randall is clearly hurt by this.
C: JUNE
D: Amy, you’re 13 and you’re obviously not going to Coachella.
N: Amy crosses her arms; this is so unfair.
C: RANDALL
D: But! How about we do a Coachella- themed birthday party in our backyard and invite all your friends!
C: JUNE
D: Oh, great idea! We can get wristbands, body glitter, uhh...
C: RANDALL
D: Port-o-pottys! We’ll get the set lists and play the music by the artists! It’ll feel like you’re really at Coachella... without all the inherent risks.
C: AMY
D: But I won’t be at Coachella. I’ll be in backyard. With my parents. While my friends are at the actual Coachella, having actual fun.
C: JUNE
D: We get that you’re frustrated. It’s just, there’s so many bad people at Coachella. So many bad people.
C: AMY
D: So you’re basically saying you don’t trust me.
C: JUNE
D: Of course we do. We just don’t trust the 99,000 other people.
C: RANDALL
D: Look, the same thing happened to me when I was your age and my parents wouldn’t let me go to a Cars concert because they weren’t sure about some of the themes in Rick Ocasik’s music-
C: AMY
D: Are you really comparing The Cars to Frank Ocean and Dababy?
C: RANDALL
D: No. Because I don’t know who those people are.
C: JUNE
D: Did you say “The Baby”? I don’t wanna sound out of touch but is there an actual baby performing at this festival?
C: AMY
D: I knew you guys would react like this! Why are you doing this to me?! I HATE YOU!!
N: Amy grabs her bag and storms out of the room.
C: RANDALL
D: ... I see.
N: Randall calmly picks up his plate and gets up from the table. - HIS MIND FLASHES TO THE FIRST TIME HE HELD AMY IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN SHE WAS BORN. Randall brushes his food scraps into the compost bin... - THE FIRST TIME AMY SAID “DADA” AS AN INFANT. Randall turns on the sink, starts doing the dishes... - AMY TAKING HER FIRST STEPS AND FALLING INTO HIS ARMS. - AMY LEARNING HOW TO RIDE A BIKE. - AMY BEING DROPPED OFF AT HER FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN. - AMY LOOKING RANDALL DEAD IN THE EYE:
C: AMY
D: I HATE YOU!!!
N: Randall drops the dish in the sink and breaks down crying.
C: RANDALL
D: She hates me.
C: JUNE
D: Hey, hey, she hates “us”. I said the same thing to my parents when I was her age.
C: RANDALL
D: But you actually hate your parents.
C: JUNE
D: And they always said they hoped this would happen to me when I had kids. God, I hate them so much. Shit, I have to be at the studio. You gonna be okay?
E: checking the time
C: RANDALL
D: Yeah... I’ll be fine.
C: JUNE
D: Okay, just- try not to take it so hard. Normal teenage stuff.
N: June hugs Randall goodbye and then leaves. He continues doing the dishes, then breaks down crying again.
S: INT. JUNE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
N: June buckles up, is about to drive, but puts it back in PARK. Clearly Amy’s words sting more than she lets on. She takes a moment to collect herself, then drives off.
S: INT. MENDELSON HOUSE - DAY
N: CLOSE ON Greg’s blissfully sleeping face. We PULL BACK to reveal he’s lying on a couch in his suit. We PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal TWO PEOPLE standing over him.
C: WOMAN
D: Wake up!
E: O.S.
N: Greg is jolted awake to find his clients MR. and MRS. MENDELSON (60’s) gawking at him. He’s still half-asleep.
C: GREG
D: MENDELSONS!! I have your inspection report. Don’t worry, it’s dry. I was just power-napping. Feeling very powerful at the moment- Owwww. Little crink. It’s fine. So, shall we review?
E: grabbing his neck
N: He gets up and there’s a NOTICEABLE DROOL PUDDLE on the cushion. Greg flips the cushion over.
C: GREG
D: I do that all the time at home.
E: CONT’D
N: The Mendelsons look very displeased with this man.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - DAY
N: Nicole and the boys PAINT. It’s everywhere. Bored, Aaron stops and grabs a Nerf Gun. Then Andrew stops and joins him.
C: NICOLE
D: You’re done? We just started painting five minutes ago... fine. Can you please at least help me clean up before you move on to the next activity?
C: ANDREW
D: We don’t want to.
C: NICOLE
D: I know you don’t want to. But sometimes when you love somebody you do things you don’t want to just to help them out and make them feel like they exist.
N: Andrew stares at his mom. Is she getting through to him? Then-
C: ANDREW
D: Wakanda Forever!
N: He unloads his Nerf Gun on Aaron. Aaron runs away, laughing and knocks over some open paints, splattering the walls.
C: NICOLE
D: Okay! Time to leave the house!
S: INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY - LATER
N: As Nicole grabs some milk, the boys fight over the cart and RAM it into the back of an ELDERLY SHOPPER’S legs.
C: ELDERLY SHOPPER
D: OW!
N: The Elderly Shopper falls to the ground, clutching her leg. Nicole rushes over to help.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh my god I’m so sorry!
N: The Elderly Shopper is badly hurt, not ready to get up.
C: NICOLE
D: Boys, what do you say?
E: CONT’D
C: ANDREW
D: Aaron did it.
C: AARON
D: No I didn’t!
N: Andrew pushes Aaron and he trips over the Elderly Shopper’s legs. Nicole physically separates them as CUSTOMERS gather to watch this train wreck. She is mortified.
C: NICOLE
D: Okay! Time to go back home!
S: INT. MINIVAN - DAY - LATER
N: Nicole drives as the boys fight over an iPad. Numb, she stops outside of A PRESCHOOL with an OPEN ENROLLMENT SIGN. She stares longingly at the throngs of kids in the yard. Then, the car behind her honks and she keeps driving.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER
N: Nicole locks the door, sits on the toilet. Finally, a moment of peace and quiet. Then, she hears the boys looking for her, calling out “MOM” over and over. She says nothing, hoping it will stop. The “MOM” “MOM” MOM” gets closer and closer until both boys are outside the bathroom door, rattling the door knob trying to get in. Nicole puts her head in her hands. I/E. YOUNG HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON Greg parks and looks up the house, not eager to go inside. He enters and sees the house is a sty, paint on the walls.
C: GREG
D: There’s paint everywhere. Why would you let them paint?
N: Nicole walks in looking extremely frazzled.
C: NICOLE
D: Why would I let them paint? Because they had to do something! They’ve been all over me all day. You don’t know what it’s like.
C: GREG
D: I have some idea what it’s like.
C: NICOLE
D: What’d you have for lunch today?
C: GREG
D: I don’t see why that’s relevant. But... a turkey club.
C: NICOLE
D: You know what I had for lunch? NOTHING! I picked at the remains of the kids’ plates like a bird at the beach. I’m on a goddamn seagull’s diet. So if you think you have the right to complain about the mess or what I let the kids do-
C: GREG
D: I don’t! I won’t! I’m sorry!
C: NICOLE
D: I’m sorry. Today was rough. I know we only have a few months of this, but I don’t know how I’m going to survive it. How was your day?
E: deep breath
N: This is the one question Greg was hoping she wouldn’t ask.
C: GREG
D: Uhhhh. You know, pretty uneventful. I’m mean, not totally uneventful. I guess there was one event worth mentioning...
E: then
C: NICOLE
D: Why are you being so coy? Did you sell the Mendelson house?!
E: suddenly hopeful
C: GREG
D: I should not have tee’d it up like that. You know I love you, right?
C: NICOLE
D: Oh no. Don’t say that.
C: GREG
D: The Mendelsons sort of decided to go... in a different direction... with me. Or without me.
C: NICOLE
D: So the Mendelson house - the one you said could sell itself, the one that’s supposed to pay for preschool - is gone? Which means I’m stuck at home with the kids now indefinitely?
E: gutted
N: Greg sees how upset Nicole is and feels ashamed.
C: GREG
D: I’m sorry. I just don’t get any sleep at night and then when I’m at work I can’t think too good. Maybe if I didn’t have to get up multiple times a night-
C: NICOLE
D: Oh, so I should be the one getting up with them all night and then also be the only one that looks after them all day?!
C: AARON
D: MOM!
E: O.S.
C: GREG
D: I’ll take care of this. Boys, what do you want?
E: calling out
C: AARON
D: We want mom.
N: Nicole walks away, devastated. Greg feels like a failure.
S: INT. OFFICE - RANDALL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: Randall is on a boring conference call, barely listening. His eyes fall on a framed FAMILY PHOTO of when the kids were much younger. They all looked so happy and together.
S: INT. ART STUDIO - LATER
N: June paints between TWO SEPARATE ART PIECES that we don’t see, bouncing between them, passionate, TEARS ARE STREAMING DOWN HER FACE. Then- her phone RINGS and snaps her out of it. She quickly wipes away her tears and answers cheerfully:
C: JUNE
D: Hi hun.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT. RANDALL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Randall is driving home, shopping bags beside him.
C: RANDALL
D: Hey! Just picked up stuff to make pot roast. Thought we could all use a family dinner. What time you think you’re home?
C: JUNE
D: Oh... sorry. I really need to stay here and work tonight. Could we do it tomorrow instead?
C: RANDALL
D: I have basketball Friday.
C: JUNE
D: Right. And my brother’s coming over Saturday.
N: Sort of an awkward silence.
C: RANDALL
D: K, no prob. I’ll just have dinner with the kids. Have a good night!
N: Randall hangs up, more than a little disappointed.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING
N: Randall finishes setting the table for dinner.
C: RANDALL
D: Kids! Dinner!
S: INT. OLSENS HOUSE - AMY’S ROOM - SOON AFTER
N: Randall knocks on Amy’s door.
C: RANDALL
D: Amy? Dinner’s on the table.
C: AMY
D: I’m not hungry.
E: O.S.
C: RANDALL
D: Okay. It’s just a lot of food.
C: AMY
D: I literally just told you I’m not hungry.
E: O.S.
C: RANDALL
D: Alright! It’ll just be a boy’s night then.
S: INT. OLSENS HOUSE - MARTY’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Randall opens Marty’s door and sees him watching Twitch.
C: RANDALL
D: Marty, hope you’re hungry.
C: MARTY
D: Starving. But can you bring it here? I’m watching a friend watch someone play a videogame.
C: RANDALL
D: Watching your friend watch a- why? Okay. I’ll bring some up.
E: giving up
S: INT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - SOON AFTER
N: Randall sits alone, sadly eating pot roast in the dark.
S: EXT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - TWO DAYS LATER - AFTERNOON
N: The YOUNG FAMILY pulls up to the house. Greg gets out, looks to the house, takes a deep breath, before he opens the door.
C: GREG
D: Hey! We’re here!
S: INT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Andrew and Aaron run in to greet Aunt June and Uncle Randall, who are just as excited to receive actual love from a kid.
C: GREG
D: Huh. A hug. Can’t remember the last time I got a greeting like that.
C: RANDALL
D: Here, I’ll give you one of those.
N: Randall pulls Greg in for a warm hug. Then, Greg and June give each other and a more perfunctory hug. It’s awkward.
S: EXT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER
N: June pours Nicole some wine. She needs it.
C: JUNE
D: Another year, huh?
C: NICOLE
D: Yup.
N: REVERSE to see they’re staring at the boys, who are taking dirt from the garden and pouring it on their heads.
C: NICOLE
D: So what’s it like not having kids crawling over you all the time?
E: CONT’D
C: JUNE
D: It’s... quiet.
E: tinge of sadness
C: NICOLE
D: Quiet... that sounds incredible.
N: They take generous sips, lost in their own thoughts.
S: EXT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - BBQ - CONTINUOUS
N: Randall and Greg are at the grill, cooking burgers. Marty walks over with a plate of buns.
C: GREG
D: Marty, how’s school going?
C: MARTY
D: Pretty good. We had a lock-down drill yesterday and it was our best time yet, so hopefully that will limit casualties if there’s ever a school shooting.
C: GREG
D: Wow. That’s terrible you even have to think about that.
N: Randall starts aggressively flipping burgers, uncomfortable.
C: MARTY
D: Although if the shooter was a student from our school, the drills might be helping them, because they’d know the procedure, where to find everyone, the exit routes-
C: RANDALL
D: ALRIGHT EVERYBODY SIT DOWN! BURGERS ARE DONE!
N: Greg leans over the BBQ to check the RARE BURGERS.
C: GREG
D: Are they?
S: EXT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - SOON AFTER
N: Both families sit at the table, chatting. Nobody has touched the burgers. The boys are still PLAYING LOUDLY in the dirt, and it’s bothering Greg. He leans over to Nicole.
C: GREG
D: Hey, the boys are being a bit-
C: NICOLE
D: I don’t care.
C: GREG
D: Got it.
N: Nicole turns to Amy, who clearly doesn’t want to be there.
C: NICOLE
D: Thanks for giving us one of your Saturday nights, Amy.
C: AMY
D: Oh it’s no problem. I’m not allowed to have a social life anyway.
C: NICOLE
D: Well if it makes you feel any better, I don’t have one either.
C: GREG
D: Hey boys! We’re eating! Can you join us at the table?
C: ANDREW
D: We can’t! We’re baking a cake!
C: GREG
D: Okay, can you just bake it a little quieter? Heh, heh.
N: The boys continue playing at the same level. Annoyed, Greg walks over to them, kneels down to make his plea:
C: GREG
D: Guys, seriously. We’re at someone else’s house right now. I need you to just listen to me-
E: CONT’D
N: Aaron SQUAWKS right in Greg’s face and continues playing. No respect. Greg rejoins the table and June smirks at him.
C: JUNE
D: How’d that go?
C: GREG
D: Oh, you know...
E: stewing
C: RANDALL
D: It’s fine, they’re just excited kids. They’re not bothering anybody. They’re laughing.
C: GREG
D: Well if it doesn’t bother you, it doesn’t bother me.
N: Greg continues eating though clearly this bothers him a lot.
C: NICOLE
D: Your tomato garden looks great.
C: JUNE
D: Thanks. I laid some plastic down on the soil before planting to warm it up. And I always use red mulch...
N: Greg nods, pretending to listen. But all he can focus on is the boys making noise. Again, he gets up from the table.
C: JUNE
D: Tomatoes love heat and the mulch really helps to retain the moisture in the soil...
E: O.C. CONT’D
N: Greg walks to the boys, offers them an iPad. This time they comply and quietly enter the house. Back at the table, June has clocked this transaction.
C: NICOLE
D: Huh. So that’s what mulch does. Never really thought that mulch about much- - that much about mulch.
E: correcting
N: June and Nicole laugh, both buzzed. Greg returns to the table. And June gives him the slightest of shit-eating grins.
C: GREG
D: What?
C: JUNE
D: Nothing. Just an interesting time to reward them with screens. Unless your goal was to reinforce the exact behavior you were trying to stop?
C: GREG
D: It was actually. That was the goal that I set, and I achieved it.
E: defensive
C: JUNE
D: Relax! I was just joking.
C: GREG
D: So was I.
N: Everyone laughs to get past this awkward moment.
C: RANDALL
D: Summer corn! Is there anything better? Sorry about the burgers.
E: then; ashamed
S: EXT. OLSEN’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: Only adults at the table now and everyone’s even drunker.
C: GREG
D: She said she hates you? Oof.
N: The wound is still fresh for Randall.
C: GREG
D: I remember the first time you said that to mom.
E: CONT’D
C: JUNE
D: Yeah, but mom deserved it. She wouldn’t buy me that... I don’t remember what it was, but she deserved it.
C: NICOLE
D: At least you have a daughter. I would love a daughter. I’m surrounded by boys. Just me in a house full of nutsacks. Honestly, even the thought of a nutsack at this point, repulses me.
N: Greg self-consciously crosses his legs.
C: JUNE
D: You know what eventually happens to daughters? They develop self-esteem issues, body image issues... and they have a right to. Their bodies and faces look straight-up weird. Acne. Backne. Rackne.
C: NICOLE
D: Tit zits.
E: off the men’s confusion
C: JUNE
D: And the raging hormones coursing through their bodies aren’t helping. Just makes them mean and manipulative and cunning-
C: GREG
D: So they basically turn into you?
C: RANDALL
D: You know what else isn’t helping? The internet. All the world’s worst things at your fingertips. Every time we try to shield Marty from the harsh realities of the world, here comes lil Greta with another devastating sound byte about the impending apocalypse. I’m sorry but a ten year old should not have to deal with that.
C: GREG
D: Yeah that sounds really tough. Hey Randall, have you got Marty’s poo on your hand recently?
C: NICOLE
D: You guys can actually talk to your kids and their brains are able to process the words. I feel like I’m a goddamn Peanuts character to my kids. It’s so. Frustrating.
C: JUNE
D: But they’re not trying to frustrate you. That’s the difference. They just need you and want your attention. Kids that age are always in the moment and you just need to be in the moment with them.
C: NICOLE
D: I am in the moment. Every waking moment.
E: insulted
C: GREG
D: We’re fine! We just need to keep our heads down for the next 5 years or so until the kids can actually do something for themselves, and life will be good again.
C: RANDALL
D: What? Then you’d be skipping over the best part! You don’t know how good you have it. Your kids still want to be around you.
C: GREG
D: How many hours do you sleep at night?
C: RANDALL JUNE
D: Not that many. 8? Oh, I need my 9.
C: GREG
D: I haven’t had 9 hours of sleep this week! Their bedtime routine lasts two full hours and doesn’t even put them to sleep. And when they finally do fall asleep, they piss the sheets and then we have to do bedtime routine all over again.
C: RANDALL
D: Bedtime routine. Ah, I miss that. Tucking them in. Kissing their sleepy foreheads.
E: MORE
C: RANDALL
D: I’m sorry. I’ve had too much wine.
E: CONT'D tearing up
N: Randall takes another massive gulp of wine. June looks at Randall, wishing there was something she could do to help him. The wheels start turning, then... AN EPIPHANY.
C: JUNE
D: Sounds like you guys need a break. Why don’t we take them off your hands for awhile?
C: NICOLE
D: Take what?
C: JUNE
D: Your boys. And you take Amy and Marty.
N: Greg, Nicole and Randall look at June. Is she serious?
C: GREG
D: Haha, that’s funny. You wouldn’t last a week.
C: JUNE
D: You don’t think I could last a week with my adorable nephews?
C: GREG
D: I know you couldn’t.
C: JUNE
D: Care to make it interesting?
C: GREG
D: Course I do! I always do!
C: RANDALL
D: What are you doing right now?
E: to June; incredulous
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: June is uncorking another bottle of wine.
C: RANDALL
D: Are you serious? Or just drunk?
C: JUNE
D: Both. I know it sounds crazy but you have been... having a bit of a rough time lately. Understandably.
E: MORE
C: JUNE
D: Things have just been so heavy with the kids and this could be a way to inject some lightness and fun back into the house.
E: CONT'D
N: Off Randall, considering-
S: EXT. OLSEN HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
N: Greg gives his pitch to Nicole.
C: GREG
D: Let’s think about this for a second. We obviously both need a break. You especially. Their kids are on auto-pilot. If we did this, we’d actually get some time to ourselves. Not just a few minutes here and there. Like, meaningful time alone. Oh my god. I could actually get some work done.
E: realizing
N: Nicole is starting to get excited. Then, feels guilty.
C: NICOLE
D: But the boys. They’d be so sad.
C: GREG
D: Right...
C: NICOLE
D: I mean, they would be with their uncle and aunt who they love and we’d be right nearby if they actually needed us.
C: GREG
D: Right! So we should do this! Right?
C: NICOLE
D: I think we should.
N: Greg and Nicole high-five enthusiastically.
C: GREG
D: Okay. We shouldn’t look too excited when they come back. Poker face.
N: Greg and Nicole put on their best poker faces.
S: EXT. OLSEN HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER
N: Both couples are back at the table finalizing the details.
C: GREG
D: The kid swap will last one week or until either side “taps out”.
C: NICOLE
D: No baby sitters or outside help of any kind. You have to know what it feels like to be trapped.
C: RANDALL
D: No internet for Marty. Also No HBO. No procedurals. Or anything that depicts violence. And no news.
C: GREG
D: No news? Is it okay for him to stare blankly at a wall?
C: JUNE
D: And no going out on school nights for Amy.
C: NICOLE
D: Alright. Is that it?
N: June and Randall look at each other. Yeah, that’s it.
C: RANDALL
D: How about you guys?
N: Greg and Nicole look at each other, gleeful.
C: NICOLE
D: Just... have fun!
N: Greg and Nicole burst out laughing. Randall and June smile, also very satisfied with this arrangement.
C: GREG
D: So what do we get when we win?
C: JUNE
D: Oh, it’s not about what the winner gets. It’s about what happens to the loser.
C: GREG
D: Humiliation bet. Classic. Just like when we were kids.
C: JUNE
D: Remember when you had to shave off your eyebrows before prom?
C: GREG
D: Yeah I remember. My date refused to go with me. This time you’ll be the one shaving. Your head! But you have to leave one of those little tufts at the front like a cartoon baby.
E: suddenly upset
C: NICOLE RANDALL
D: I’m not doing that. I need my hair.
C: JUNE
D: How about winner gets to pick the loser’s Halloween costumes?
C: GREG
D: No black face. No pedophiles.
C: JUNE
D: Ugh, then what’s the point? Got it! Tramp stamps. His and hers.
E: thinking
C: NICOLE
D: I’m not permanently inking the small of my back over this.
C: RANDALL
D: Yeah, neither am I.
C: JUNE
D: Fine. Henna. Only lasts 3 weeks. But the photo shoot will last a life time.
N: Greg, Nicole and Randall look at each other; they can live with this. They all raise their glasses.
C: GREG
D: A toast. To the two of you, for embracing the joy of early childhood. May it be as constant and unrelenting for you as it’s been for us.
C: JUNE
D: And to you, for taking your first dip in the bottomless reservoir that is teenage angst.
N: They clink glasses. Done deal.
S: INT. MINIVAN - LATER
N: Greg and Nicole are driving home, ecstatic. The boys are passed out in their car seats.
C: GREG
D: The craziest part is that she’s the one that suggested it! She doesn’t stand a chance. Oh my god... I’m actually going to beat her at something.
C: NICOLE
D: I just feel bad for their kids. No wonder they don’t want to spend time with their parents, they don’t let them do anything.
C: GREG
D: Imagine complaining about your kids not wanting to spend time with you. You know what I call that? Vacation.
C: NICOLE
D: We’re basically about to go on vacation!
C: ANDREW
D: We’re going on vacation?
E: O.S.
N: Greg and Nicole are surprised the boys are actually awake. They look at each other, unsure how to broach the subject.
C: NICOLE
D: Uhhhhh, yeah. Sort of.
C: GREG
D: How would you guys like to go to your uncle and aunt’s for a sleepover? Like a big one?
C: AARON
D: Can Mom come?
C: NICOLE
D: No.
N: Andrew and Aaron both start whining.
C: GREG
D: But you didn’t hear the best part! You don’t have to listen to them. Cuz they’re not your parents.
C: ANDREW
D: Will they make us chicken nuggets?
C: GREG
D: If you scream loud enough for them.
C: ANDREW / AARON
D: YAYYYYYYY!!!
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Randall and June are cleaning up together.
C: RANDALL
D: How are we gonna tell the kids?
C: JUNE
D: I think we just do it gently. Let them know they’re loved and that this isn’t us wanting time away from them.
C: RANDALL
D: But that’s exactly what it is.
C: JUNE
D: I know. I’m saying we shouldn’t make it too obvious.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Family meeting in progress.
C: JUNE
D: Again, this has nothing to do with you and everything to do with your uncle and aunt needing some help. So... how would you feel if we took the boys and you stayed at their place for a week...?
C: AMY
D: How about a year?
N: Amy exits. Marty follows. June and Randall share a look; that was insulting, but also easier than expected.
S: EXT. BANK - PARKING LOT - THE NEXT DAY
N: Two cars park in front of each other, mafia-style.
S: INT. OLSENS CAR - MOMENTS LATER
N: Randall and June turn around to face their kids. But Amy and Marty have already exited the car.
C: RANDALL
D: Goodbye?
S: INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS
N: Greg and Nicole turn to face their kids.
C: NICOLE
D: You know how much we love you and how we’re gonna miss you, right?
N: The boys nod.
S: EXT. BANK PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
N: RAPID SHOTS OF: minivan doors slide open, car seats unlatched, car seats are set on the ground with the BOYS STILL SITTING IN THEM.
C: JUNE
D: Oh yeah. Car seats. It’s been so long I kinda forgot how to-
C: GREG
D: Ehhh, you’ll figure it out.
N: Greg and Nicole hop back in the minivan and peel off.
S: INT. OLSEN CAR - LATER
N: Randall and June, sweaty, finally get the car seats fastened.
C: ANDREW
D: That took you a long time.
C: RANDALL
D: Yes, but it didn’t get me upset. I still have a smile on my face.
C: JUNE
D: Which is what you’re gonna have on your faces because we’re going... ... to DISNEYLAND!
E: pulls out Mickey hats
N: The boys CHEER! Randall and June soak it up, turn on the radio and crank the music. Fun! Fun! Fun!
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - LATER
N: Greg and Nicole lead Amy and Marty inside.
C: NICOLE
D: Alright. Welcome to your home. Amy, you can sleep in the boys room.
N: Nicole opens the door revealing the room’s been re-decorated with ‘nSync posters and other circa 2000 teen girl adornments. Amy looks kind of shocked.
C: NICOLE
D: I wanted to redecorate for you but all I could find was stuff from my teenage years. Do girls still like Justin Timberlake?
E: CONT’D
C: AMY
D: Well, he did cheat on Jessica Biel. But she’s an anti-vaxxer so I’m kinda glad he did.
E: beat
C: NICOLE
D: So leave the posters up, or...
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - OFFICE - LATER
N: Greg and Marty stand over a small air mattress on the floor.
C: GREG
D: Sorry this is smaller than your room at home...
N: But all Marty’s focused on is the DESKTOP COMPUTER.
C: MARTY
D: I love it.
C: GREG
D: Really? Okay! So, what now? Should I be making you lunch?
C: MARTY
D: I can make my own lunch.
C: GREG
D: Seriously? Like, I don’t have to?
C: MARTY
D: Pretty sure I know how to make a sandwich, Uncle Greg.
C: GREG
D: Okay... do you know how to make two of them?
N: Marty nods. Is this kid really going to make him lunch?
S: EXT. DISNEYLAND - AFTERNOON
N: Randall, June and the boys enter the park, wide-eyed.
C: RANDALL
D: Race you to Toon Town!
N: Randall and June take off. The boys chase them, excitedly. - They all ride the Toon Town Roller Coaster. It’s hard to tell who’s more excited, the kids or the adults. - They take a GROUP PHOTO WITH GOOFY.
C: ANDREW
D: Can we have hot dogs for dinner?
C: RANDALL
D: YES!
N: - They all eat hot dogs.
C: AARON
D: Can we get toys from the gift shop?
C: JUNE
D: YES!
N: - The boys walk out of the gift shop with toys.
C: AARON
D: Can we ride Splash Mountain again?
C: JUNE
D: YES!
N: - They ride Splash Mountain and then get the souvenir photo.
C: ANDREW
D: Can we-
C: RANDALL
D: I’m gonna stop you right there. The answer’s YES!
N: Best. Day. Ever.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BOYS ROOM - LATER
N: Nicole and Amy hang out, looking at PICTURES on Amy’s phone.
C: NICOLE
D: Is that you and your teacher?
C: AMY
D: No, that’s my friend, Jasmine.
N: PHOTO of JASMINE, who does not look 13 years old.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh. She’s in your class? She looks... mature.
C: AMY
D: Yeah, she’s super cool. She has the best clothes, and like the most Insta followers in our school.
C: NICOLE
D: That is the barometer for cool these days. How about you? You got a lot of followers?
C: AMY
D: I got a lot more since I became friends with Jasmine.
C: NICOLE
D: Sounds like your relationship with this girl is pretty important.
C: AMY
D: It is. Not that my parents care. They won’t let me go with her to Coachella. I can’t even go to her house tomorrow and literally everyone’s gonna be there.
C: NICOLE
D: Right. It’s a school night.
C: AMY
D: Although technically, this week, you’re my parent but... whatever.
N: Nicole senses an opportunity to be a hero.
C: NICOLE
D: You know what? You deserve to have a life. You’re young. You’re free. That doesn’t last forever. Go be free!
C: AMY
D: Are you serious right now?!
C: NICOLE
D: Does the devil wear Prada?
C: AMY
D: What?
C: NICOLE
D: It means yes. Yes, you can go to Jasmine’s tomorrow!
N: Amy jumps up and hugs Nicole. Nicole beams.
C: AMY
D: You’re the coolest aunt ever!
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER
N: Greg and Marty eat sandwiches together. Then:
C: MARTY
D: Did my parents send me here because they’re sick of me?
C: GREG
D: What? No. Why would you say that?
C: MARTY
D: Every time I try to talk to them about something important they just change the subject. Like one time I asked about Nazi Germany and my dad just put on a bunch of David Hasselhoff music videos and danced in the kitchen until I walked away.
C: GREG
D: Yeah that sounds like Randall.
C: MARTY
D: I wouldn’t say that they’re Holocaust deniers but they sure aren’t talking about it. At least not to me. I guess I should just keep all that stuff to myself.
C: GREG
D: No! What? You shouldn’t have to hide anything from your parents. It’s not your fault for asking those questions. It’s their fault for not answering them. They’re, like, not doing their job.
N: Greg notices Marty looking even sadder. He reels it back.
C: GREG
D: Look, your parents just want to protect you. They want you to be a kid and to not have to worry. But, I’m your uncle and if you wanna worry about depressing stuff around me then knock yourself out.
E: CONT’D
C: MARTY
D: Really? Okay. Uh, the whole Israel- Palestine thing. How did it start? Who’s fault is it?
C: GREG
D: That’s a whole chicken and egg situation. Full disclosure, I’m not exactly a Middle East expert, but I’d say the real reason for all the bloodshed? It’s the heat. You can’t solve anything in those conditions.
C: MARTY
D: I have noticed there’s always people fighting over parking spaces at the beach.
C: GREG
D: There you go! It’s the heat. What else you got? Hit me. This is fun.
C: MARTY
D: Is it true it’s not okay to listen to Michael Jackson anymore?
C: GREG
D: Hmm. Depends who you ask. If you wanna be safe just stick to Jackson 5. Before he reached the age where he was able to... you know...
C: MARTY
D: What?
C: GREG
D: Before he could... allegedly... you know...
C: MARTY
D: I don’t. Tell me!
C: GREG
D: Okay, maybe we should finish eating first. While we still have our appetites.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER
N: Greg and Nicole meet up. The house is quiet for once.
C: NICOLE
D: Amy’s settling in. She’s just on her phone.
C: GREG
D: Yeah, Marty’s just hanging out in his room, doing his own thing.
N: They stare at each other, unsure what to do with themselves.
C: NICOLE
D: What do we do now?
C: GREG
D: Anything we want?
C: NICOLE
D: Let’s clean the house!
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - LATER
N: Greg and Nicole pop a bottle of champagne. They drink and clean the house while dancing to music.
S: EXT. DISNEYLAND - MAIN STREET - EVENING
N: The boys are on June and Randall’s shoulders, mesmerized by the FIREWORKS display. Randall and June hold hands and smile at each other. They’re reconnecting.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - LATER
N: The house is spotless. Greg and Nicole admire their work.
C: GREG
D: I put up the new towel rack in the bathroom. I’ve been meaning to do that for three years.
C: NICOLE
D: I finished the laundry. Like, finished it. There’s nothing in the washer or dryer. It’s done. Everything’s clean.
C: GREG
D: This is insane. They’re still in their rooms.
C: NICOLE
D: I know. Should we check on them? You guys need anything?! You okay?
E: calling out
C: MARTY AMY
D: Nope! Good night! All good!
E: O.S. O.S.
N: Greg and Nicole stare at each other in disbelief.
C: GREG / NICOLE
D: K! Good night!
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Greg and Nicole, in bed, finish the last of the champagne.
C: NICOLE
D: I feel like this is the first time we’ve been in bed together this early in so long.
C: GREG
D: These sheets feel so clean.
N: They lay there for a beat.
C: GREG
D: So... this kinda feels like the perfect opportunity to have sex.
E: CONT’D
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah. It really does.
C: GREG
D: Do you... want to?
C: NICOLE
D: I don’t know... do you?
C: GREG
D: ... not really.
C: NICOLE
D: Me neither. I kinda just wanna go to sleep.
C: GREG
D: Me too! God I love you so much.
N: They kiss each other, both roll over and turn off the lights. I/E. OLSENS HOUSE - NIGHT Randall and June carry the sleeping boys from the car to their beds, tucking them in.
S: INT. OLSENS HOUSE - BEDROOM - SOON AFTER
N: June and Randall get ready for bed.
C: RANDALL
D: I can’t even remember the last time we had a family day. You were right. This was a great idea.
C: JUNE
D: It really was. I had a great time.
N: Randall scrolls through the PICTURES he took at Disneyland.
C: RANDALL
D: Look how happy they look. Not a care in the world. I don’t know what Greg and Nicole are complaining about. You’d think after being parents for five years they’d be better at this by now.
C: JUNE
D: Well, Greg was the baby who never had to learn how to do anything on his own, so not totally surprising. We should send them all of these pictures. Rub it in their faces how well we’re doing.
E: then
C: RANDALL
D: Yup! I’ll go take pictures of the boys sleeping soundly!
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
N: June and Randall are woken up by a tug on their blanket.
C: ANDREW
D: We’re hungry.
C: RANDALL
D: Wow. The first thing they wanna do in the morning is be with us.
C: JUNE
D: Such a gift.
C: RANDALL
D: So how do you wanna coordinate work schedules? Should we trade off or-
C: JUNE
D: I was actually thinking of taking the day off...
C: RANDALL
D: I could call in a sick day...
N: They smile at each other, excited to play hookie together.
C: RANDALL
D: Who wants pancakes?!
E: CONT’D
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MORNING
N: Randall and June, still in pajamas, make pancakes with the boys, who stand on step stools to reach over the counter.
C: JUNE
D: So we need to add flour, milk and one egg to the bowl and then we mix, mix, mix it all together.
C: AARON
D: I get to crack the egg!
C: ANDREW
D: No, I wanna crack it!
N: As June hands the egg to Aaron, Andrew reaches over and the egg falls onto the floor, breaking. Aaron starts pouting.
C: AARON
D: Andrew broke my egg.
C: ANDREW
D: No, you dropped it. Cuz you’re a stupid baby with stupid baby hands.
N: Aaron PUSHES Andrew. Andrew SMACKS Aaron back. Before things can escalate, Randall pulls out more eggs from the fridge.
C: RANDALL
D: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You guys, look! We have sooooo many more eggs! Watch. I’m a real egghead!
N: Randall takes out an egg, places it on his head, and lets it fall to the ground. The boys laugh. Then, June hands each of the boys their own bowl and egg.
C: AARON
D: Look at me! I’m a real egghead!
N: Aaron puts the egg on his head and it smashes on the floor.
C: ANDREW
D: Look at me! I’m a real egghead!
C: RANDALL
D: Wait! That’s our-
N: Andrew’s egg falls to the floor.
C: RANDALL
D: - last egg. So much for pancakes.
E: CONT’D
C: JUNE
D: That’s okay! We have cereal!
E: off the boys’ GROANS
C: ANDREW
D: Ugh. Cereal’s so boring.
C: RANDALL
D: Not if you eat your cereal like... a HIPPOPOTAMUS!!!
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Randall, June, Andrew and Aaron crawl on their hands and knees pretending to be hippos, eating cereal off the floor.
C: AARON
D: More river plants!
N: June pours more dry cereal on the floor.
C: ANDREW
D: What a beautiful day to chomp down river plants in our favorite river.
N: June and Randall give each other approving nods and then crawl up to each other for a hushed conversation.
C: JUNE
D: See? All you have to do is turn a potentially bad situation into a fun game and recapture their imagination. It’s simple.
N: The boys are now WRESTLING over the cereal on the floor.
C: RANDALL
D: Easy, easy. Plenty of river plants to go around. Uh oh. I think we inadvertently created a human game of Hungry, Hungry Hippos.
E: to June
N: The boys start KICKING and PUNCHING each other.
C: JUNE
D: Let’s be happy hippos! Oh look, a tourist boat! They want to take pictures of the happy hippos! Smile for the tourists!
N: It’s not working. The boys won’t separate.
C: RANDALL
D: Jeez. He kicked him right in the small of the back. All over a Cheerio. How do we get them to stop fighting?
C: JUNE
D: ...maybe we don’t.
N: June and Randall share a knowing look.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - MORNING
N: Greg and Nicole wake up. The clock reads 8:40am.
C: NICOLE
D: Did the clocks move forward last night?
C: GREG
D: No. I think we... slept in. My body feels like, different.
C: NICOLE
D: Yes. I feel like, what’s the word I’m looking for? Rested.
N: Greg checks his phone and sees 10 NEW TEXTS from June.
C: GREG
D: Oh, you bitch.
C: NICOLE
D: Excuse me?
C: GREG
D: Not you. June. I’m allowed to call her that cuz she’s my sister.
C: NICOLE
D: Are you?
C: GREG
D: I’m not totally sure, but look at what she sent.
N: We see ALL THE HAPPY PHOTOS June and Randall took at Disneyland, capped off with a photo of the boys sleeping with the caption: Bedtime Routine. 2 Seconds #goodparenting
C: NICOLE
D: Oh, that bitch! Let’s go take pictures of their happy kids and rub it in their faces.
C: GREG
D: Yes! You see what great ideas we come up with when we sleep?
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - OFFICE - LATER
N: Greg and Nicole go to Marty’s room but he’s not in there.
C: GREG
D: Must be in the bathroom.
C: NICOLE
D: Well we’re not gonna take a picture of him in there.
N: As they’re about to leave, they hear the FAINT SOUNDS OF MOANING. It’s coming from the computer.
C: NICOLE
D: Ohhhhh no. That’s not...
E: CONT’D
N: They warily approach the computer. Greg clicks the mouse with a shaky finger. Sure enough, it’s PORNOGRAPHY.
C: NICOLE
D: Ew!
E: CONT’D
C: GREG
D: Let’s not overreact. Could just be a pop-up.
C: NICOLE
D: Check the search history.
C: GREG
D: You check it.
C: NICOLE
D: I’m not touching that mouse!
N: Greg checks the SEARCH HISTORY. It’s a long graphic list.
C: NICOLE
D: God, did he even sleep last night?!
E: CONT’D
C: GREG
D: Jesus. We weren’t even supposed to give him internet and now he’s discovered the entire world of porn? He left no stone unturned! He saw all of it! What do we do?!
C: NICOLE
D: If we were June and Randall, we’d sweep this whole incident under the rug, pretend it didn’t happen, and cancel the internet until he was 21. But that’s not us.
C: GREG
D: Right... we’re not his parents. This doesn’t have to be weird.
E: MORE
C: GREG
D: We should just play it cool and talk to him about it.
E: CONT'D
C: NICOLE
D: Exactly. We’re the cool ones.
C: GREG
D: We just have to make sure he doesn’t feel ashamed. That kind of thing can leave a lasting impression. His eyes cannot hit the ground.
C: MARTY
D: Hey.
E: O.S.
N: Greg and Nicole are startled. Marty sees them at the computer and his face turns beet red, starts looking down.
C: GREG
D: No-no-no! Don’t look down!
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - OFFICE - LATER
N: Greg and Nicole are seated across from Marty.
C: NICOLE
D: There’s nothing to be ashamed of here. Your body’s changing and we know it can be a confusing time.
C: GREG
D: I’m a guy. I’ve been there. When you’re a kid, all you’re using that thing for is peeing. Maybe the occasional sword fight. Then you reach an age where you realize it can do other... tricks.
C: MARTY
D: I was just watching.
C: NICOLE
D: Sure. Sure you were... do you have any questions about what you “watched”?
C: MARTY
D: Not really.
C: NICOLE
D: Okay... well the thing to keep in mind is that watching too much of that stuff can warp your perception of what sex is like in real life.
C: GREG
D: Yeah, in real life, women aren’t usually that “enthusiastic”.
N: Nicole shoots Greg a look.
C: NICOLE
D: And the average man is a lot more... let’s say “average” sized.
C: GREG
D: Yeah, and in real life, you’ll find that women aren’t willing to do the vast majority of “acts” you saw.
C: MARTY
D: Okay, are you almost done? I think I can sort of figure out the rest on my own.
N: Marty sits back at the desk. Greg disconnects the computer and picks it up. It’s heavier than he thought it would be.
C: GREG
D: Yeah... probably time you take a little breather from the videos. But not because you should feel ashamed about it. Though you should probably keep this a secret from your parents. They don’t have to know about this.
E: then then
C: MARTY
D: But yesterday you told me I shouldn’t have to hide anything from my parents.
C: GREG
D: That’s true. But this is different.
C: MARTY
D: Why? Unless there’s a reason you want me to hide this from them...
E: off Greg’s silence MORE
C: MARTY
D: which I would entertain... if you put the computer back...
E: CONT'D
N: Greg looks down at the computer in his hands.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Greg finishes reconnecting the computer. He nods to Marty as he and Nicole leave the room.
C: NICOLE
D: Well, that was a disgusting way to start our morning.
E: sotto; to Greg
S: EXT. OLSEN HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER
N: Andrew and Aaron are dressed in bathrobes with PILLOW CUSHIONS TAPED TO THEIR HEADS AND HANDS. They both sit on tiny stools in the corners of a MAKESHIFT BOXING RING. Randall enters the ring and calls them to the middle.
C: RANDALL
D: Alright gentlemen. I want a clean fight. That means no biting, no rabbit punches, and no hitting below the belt.
C: ANDREW
D: We’re not wearing any belts.
C: RANDALL
D: Perfect. Now touch gloves and wait for the sound of the bell.
N: The boys nod excitedly as Randall climbs out the ring. June holds up the MINI GONG and a MINI MALLET.
C: JUNE
D: Ready? Get set? FIGHT!
E: banging the gong
N: Andrew and Aaron unload punches on each other but feel nothing. It’s light and playful, cushions hitting cushions.
C: JUNE
D: That’s it Aaron! When he goes low, you go high!
E: CONT’D
C: RANDALL
D: I don’t think that advice was meant to apply to boxing matches but it totally works.
C: JUNE
D: Greg and Nicole would never do something like this in a million years. That’s how I know it’s smart.
C: RANDALL
D: These boys are like a pressure cooker. You gotta give them an opportunity to release.
C: JUNE
D: Exactly. And we’re doing it responsibly in a safe environment.
C: RANDALL
D: Speaking of which, I only found one old mouth guard. You think that’s a problem?
C: JUNE
D: No. They can’t really hurt each other when they’re this young.
N: Andrew lands a big punch, knocking Aaron to the corner. Andrew raises his hands in victory. June and Randall rush over to Aaron for coaching.
C: RANDALL
D: Come on, Aaron! Don’t let him clown you like that!
C: JUNE
D: I want you to think of every mean thing your brother’s ever done to you. I want you to bottle it. Drink it. Then punch him as hard as you can in the chest with it.
N: Aaron gets up, emboldened, charges at Andrew and throws all his weight into a punch. Surprised, Andrew flies back.
C: JUNE/RANDALL
D: AA-RON! AA-RON! AA-RON!
N: Andrew gets up, angry. As he winds up for ONE MASSIVE PUNCH, the tape around his wrists comes loose, the cushion flies off, and he LANDS A CRUSHING BLOW TO AARON’S NOSE WITH HIS BARE FIST! Aaron screams, covering his face.
C: JUNE/RANDALL
D: OHHHHH!
E: CONT’D
N: June and Randall rush into the ring. They pull Aaron’s hands away and see his NOSE IS BLEEDING AND HIS EYE IS RED.
C: RANDALL
D: I’ll get ice!
N: Randall rushes off. June applies a towel to Aaron’s nose as he cries hysterically.
C: ANDREW
D: Haha, I win. You lose.
C: JUNE
D: Andrew, go to your corner! Shhh. Let’s just try to calm down. How about we sing a song? Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens. Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens.
E: to Aaron singing
N: This actually starts working. Aaron begins to settle down, catching his breath. June smiles at him and continues.
C: JUNE
D: Brown paper baskets all tied up with strings, these are a few of my favorite things. When the dog bites. When the bee stings. When I’m feeling sad...
E: CONT’D
N: Upon hearing those lyrics, Aaron’s eyes well up with tears.
C: JUNE
D: Oh no. I’m sorry. Did that part make you sad?
E: CONT’D
C: AARON
D: Yeaaaaaaaaaaaah.
E: bursts out crying
C: JUNE
D: Wait, there’s more! I simply remember my favorite things and then I don’t feel so bad. See? The whole point of the song is to not feel bad!
E: singing cheerfully then MORE
C: JUNE
D: Think about your favorite things, huh? Can you name one of your favorite things?
E: CONT'D
C: AARON
D: My maaaaa-maaaaa.
E: crying even harder
N: Randall returns and tries to apply the ice to Aaron’s eye. Aaron knocks his hand away, in hysterics.
C: ANDREW
D: He doesn’t want ice. He wants mom.
C: JUNE
D: Aaron, sweetie, I’m also a mom.
C: ANDREW
D: He doesn’t want a mom. He wants mom mom.
N: Aaron continues to wail. June and Randall look at each other, unsure what to do.
C: NEIGHBOR
D: Is everything okay? Someone sounds really hurt over there.
E: O.S.
C: JUNE
D: Everything’s fine, Mr. Abrahmson! Go back to your morning gin and tonic.
E: under her breath
C: RANDALL
D: Should we call Nicole?
C: JUNE
D: And show weakness? No chance. It’s only Day Two. I would never give Greg the satisfaction.
C: RANDALL
D: Satisfaction? This isn’t a duel.
C: JUNE
D: Don’t be so naive, Randall. That’s exactly what this is.
C: RANDALL
D: Alright, well we need to do something.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER
N: The boys are on the couch, glued to the TV. Randall and June watch them from kitchen.
C: JUNE
D: You think Greg and Nicole will notice?
N: REVEAL Aaron has TWO SWOLLEN EYES and balled-up Kleenex stuffed in his nostrils.
C: RANDALL
D: I’m gonna say... definitely.
C: JUNE
D: Come on. A little make-up, a little concealer. I feel like we can hide this from them.
C: RANDALL
D: Maaaaaybe. At least the TV made him stop screaming. Neither of them have moved a muscle in ten minutes.
E: then
C: JUNE
D: As long as he’s not crying for his mom I say we roll with it.
C: RANDALL
D: We can turn it into a movie night. Order some pizza?
C: JUNE
D: Love it.
N: June and Randall happily join the kids on the couch.
S: INT. REAL ESTATE PROPERTY - DAY
N: Greg struggles to stage an open house. He’s well-rested and yet, still looks miserable doing this. Then Nicole enters holding a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS. Greg is pleasantly surprised.
C: GREG
D: Hey! What are you doing here?
C: NICOLE
D: The kids are at school. Like, all day. Thought I’d swing by and drop these off for your open.
C: GREG
D: Wow. Thanks!
N: Nicole puts the bouquet down and then takes a look at the way the living room is staged. Hmmmm.
C: GREG
D: What?
E: CONT’D
C: NICOLE
D: Oh nothing. It’s just, if you moved those two chairs over here, you can turn this area into a nice reading space. Plus it would open up the whole living room. But I don’t wanna-
E: then stopping herself
C: GREG
D: No. It’s totally fine. Go ahead.
N: Greg and Nicole are both walking on eggshells, careful not to offend each other. They move the chairs to the new spot.
C: GREG
D: Yeah, definitely feels more open.
E: CONT’D
C: NICOLE
D: K, I should get out of your hair.
C: GREG
D: You sure? You don’t have to.
C: NICOLE
D: No, I’ll let you do your thing.
C: GREG
D: Okay. What are you going to do? You have the whole day to yourself. Finally.
C: NICOLE
D: I know! Exciting!
S: INT. GROCERY STORE - LATER
N: Nicole walks down an empty aisle, shopping alone. Not remotely exciting.
S: INT. YOUNG HOME - KITCHEN - LATER
N: Nicole anxiously sits at the table, no idea what to do with herself. Then Marty walks in the door, home from school. She immediately perks up and pounces on him.
C: NICOLE
D: Hey Marty! How was school?
C: MARTY
D: Fine.
C: NICOLE
D: Can I help with your homework? Make you something to eat?
C: MARTY
D: No, I’m good. Got everything I need right in here.
N: Marty walks into the office and closes the door. Gross. Nicole returns to the table. She’s restless, antsy. So she decides to text AMY: Nicole - Is 8:00 still cool for a pick-up? AMY - 9:00 would be cooler. I can also get a ride home from Debbie’s mom. Is that okay? Nicole’s a bit disappointed, then types in “No problem” - then changes it to “NP” - then finally settles on “Obvs” and presses send. She stares at her phone, waiting for a response that never comes.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING
N: June, Randall and the kids are still on the couch, empty pizza boxes on the table, when the movie ends.
C: RANDALL
D: Alright! Now we know how a talking pig gets by in the city. Pretty well!
N: As soon as Randall turns off the TV, the boys snap out of their zombie-like state and start WRITHING AROUND ON THE COUCH, like they’re crawling out of their skin.
C: ANDREW / AARON
D: BAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!
C: JUNE
D: Jesus. What is happening? It’s like they’re going through detox.
C: RANDALL
D: It looks like they’re in real pain.
C: AARON ANDREW
D: ONE MORE SHOW!! PUT IT BACK ON!
C: RANDALL
D: This is too much. I can’t take it.
N: Randall turns the TV back on, and the boys return to their zombie-like state.
C: JUNE
D: Okay, one more show and then bedtime. Deal?
C: ANDREW / AARON
D: Deal.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: The show ends and June turns off the TV.
C: JUNE
D: Alright, show’s over. Bedtime.
N: The boys’ writhing/flailing is even worse now.
C: RANDALL
D: I don’t think that extra show helped. We just gave addicts more of the drug.
C: JUNE
D: Time for them to go cold turkey. Bedtime intervention!
N: June and Randall pick up the boys and carry them to their room. The boys groan and move spastically trying to get away.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER
N: As June tucks the boys in bed, Randall enters carrying a CHEST OF AMY & MARTY’S CHILDHOOD MEMORABILIA.
C: RANDALL
D: Who’s ready for story-time?
C: ANDREW/AARON
D: ME!
C: JUNE
D: Oh my god. Look at all this stuff. It’s been so long.
N: June and Randall flip through the items in the chest, nostalgic. She pulls out a book.
C: JUNE
D: Corduroy. Marty’s favorite.
E: CONT’D
C: AARON
D: I don’t like bears.
C: JUNE
D: Okay. How about The Gruffalo? He’s not quite a bear. And not quite a... I’m not really sure what he is. Should we find out?
C: AARON
D: Yeah!
N: June and Randall start reading with great enthusiasm. The boys snuggle in. June and Randall are loving this.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Greg and Marty sit on the couch watching Planet Earth - specifically the part with the starving, yellow polar bear.
C: GREG
D: When I was a kid, polar bears were white. Look at this guy - was he rolling around in honey or something?
C: MARTY
D: She’s starving, Uncle Greg.
C: SIR DAVID
D: She’s tired, emaciated, and must find food quickly. Her fat reserves hardly protect her from the cold.
E: V.O.
C: GREG
D: Oof. You’d think the film crew might toss her some trail mix or something.
N: Nicole paces, looking out the window and checking the time.
C: GREG
D: Can you please relax? You’re the one that convinced me letting her go out on school night was okay because she’d never tell June and Randall. What’s the big deal?
E: CONT’D
C: NICOLE
D: Ummm, that it’s past 9 and she’s not texting me back.
C: GREG
D: Oh, seriously? That’s not good.
C: NICOLE
D: Now you sound worried. Maybe you should go pick her up. I’ll stay here with Marty.
C: GREG
D: Why do I have to go?
C: NICOLE
D: I sort of positioned myself as the cool aunt and that might hurt my image... Ok fine we’ll both go. Marty, we’ll be right back. You gonna be okay on your own?
E: off Greg’s stare
N: On the TV, there’s a shot of ICE CAPS falling into the ocean. Marty’s eyes well up with tears, and through his glassy eyes we see the reflection of the fallen ice caps. But Greg and Nicole are practically out the door, too distracted to notice their distraught nephew.
C: GREG
D: Ehhh, you’ll be fine.
S: INT. OLSENS HOUSE - BEDROOM - MUCH LATER
N: There’s now a PILE OF BOOKS on the floor. June and Randall look tired but they’re braving through it.
C: JUNE
D: Okay! That’s ALL of the books. Literally every one.
N: June and Randall both get up and kiss the boys good night.
C: RANDALL
D: See you boys in the morning.
C: ANDREW
D: We’re not tired. We want an Avengers book.
C: RANDALL
D: We don’t have any of those. They weren’t quite as popular when Amy and Marty were your age.
C: ANDREW
D: Then make it up.
N: Randall sighs, not wanting to disappoint the kids.
C: RANDALL
D: Ummmm... okay. Once upon a time in... Avenger’s land-
C: AARON
D: Asgard!
C: RANDALL
D: Right. Asgard. Thor was using his hammer to... build a... new house out of... space bricks.
C: ANDREW
D: Okay...
C: RANDALL
D: That’s when his brother...
C: AARON
D: Loki!
C: RANDALL
D: Loki. Stole Thor’s hammer because he wanted to make his own house-
C: AARON
D: Loki can’t lift Mjolnir!
N: June heads for the door. Randall notices.
C: RANDALL
D: Hey, you’re leaving?
C: JUNE
D: I was just gonna go do the dishes.
C: RANDALL
D: There aren’t any. We ordered pizza.
C: JUNE
D: I’ll flatten the boxes. You’re doing great. Keep going.
N: Before Randall can say anything else, she’s out the door.
C: ANDREW AARON *
D: Loki’s a shape shifter! Make him transform!
N: Randall looks to the door, yearning to walk through it.
S: EXT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - LATER
N: Greg and Nicole pull up to the house and approach the front door. Nicole LIGHTLY knocks on it.
C: GREG
D: You barely touched it. They’re not gonna hear that.
N: Greg knocks louder. A 16 YEAR OLD BOY (XANDER) answers.
C: XANDER
D: Yeah?
C: GREG
D: Uh, hi. Are your parents home?
C: XANDER
D: Nope.
C: NICOLE
D: Huh, she didn’t mention that. Okay. We’re here to pick up Amy. Can you quietly let her know her uncle is waiting for her outside?
E: to Xander
N: A GIRL flirtatiously pulls Xander away by the arm.
C: XANDER
D: You can just tell her yourself. She’s in the basement.
N: Greg and Nicole stand in the open doorway, unsure. The sound of BUMP N’ GRIND R&B MUSIC emanates from the basement.
C: NICOLE
D: R&B? In the basement?
C: GREG
D: Don’t jump to conclusions. Maybe they’re watching Surviving R Kelly and that’s why we’re hearing those sexy slow jams.
N: They step inside, slowly moving towards the basement stairs.
S: INT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - BASEMENT STAIRWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: They inch down the stairs, hearts pounding. They hide behind the wall, careful not to be seen.
C: NICOLE
D: Look.
C: GREG
D: You look.
N: Nicole puts her phone on CAMERA MODE and holds it out to get a view of the basement: a mix of 13 year old girls and 16 year old boys. Some dancing, some flirting on the couch.
C: NICOLE
D: She told me it would just be girls over. Not boys with full beards.
C: GREG
D: I’m not liking the age discrepancy here. And the R Kelly music definitely isn’t helping.
C: NICOLE
D: I can’t see Amy.
N: Nicole extends her arm further to get a better view.
C: JASMINE
D: Uhhh, whose arm is that?
E: O.S.
N: Greg and Nicole gasp. She quickly pulls her arm back. Jasmine rushes over.
C: JASMINE
D: Who are you? What are you doing in my house?
E: CONT’D
N: Greg and Nicole are busted. They step out from behind the wall and try to play it cool. The party stops. All eyes are on them, including AMY, who is mortified.
C: NICOLE
D: Hey girrrrl. We’re uh- - hey, what are we doing here?
E: to Greg
C: GREG
D: I’ll tell you what we’re not here to do. And that’s, kill the vibe.
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah, don’t mind us. Please continue... vibing.
C: JASMINE
D: Were you just filming us?
C: NICOLE
D: Oh, this? No, I just had it out and I always keep it on camera mode for my Insta, but I’m not recording. Oh shit, I am. But I’ll delete it.
E: re: phone noticing
N: Amy rushes over and pushes Greg and Nicole up the stairs.
C: AMY
D: Can you get out of here?! Please!
E: quietly
C: GREG
D: Yes! We desperately want to. But, with you.
E: quietly
C: JASMINE
D: Amy, they’re right. It’s a school night and it’s probably past your bedtime anyway.
N: Some SNICKERING from other kids at the party. Mortified, Amy pushes Greg and Nicole up the stairs.
S: INT. MINIVAN - SOON AFTER
N: Amy SLAMS the van door behind her.
C: AMY
D: I can’t BELIEVE you just did that.
C: NICOLE
D: I’m sorry, honey. It was your uncle’s idea. I tried to talk him out of it.
C: GREG
D: Wow. Just... wow.
C: NICOLE
D: In fairness to your uncle, you did mention you’d be home by 9 and you weren’t responding to texts so, that’s probably why he got so bent out of shape about it.
C: GREG
D: Ah, doubling down on it. Okay.
C: AMY
D: That was the most embarrassing thing that has EVER HAPPENED TO ANYONE!
C: GREG
D: Oh yeah? I once got tackled at the homecoming game and my football pants got ripped off in front of the whole school. It was infinitely more embarrassing. The Mayor was there.
C: NICOLE
D: I’m sure it’s not as bad as you’re building it up to be in your head-
N: Then, Amy’s phone starts DINGING. She looks at it.
C: AMY
D: AHHHHHHH!!!
N: Greg swerves, nearly colliding with a fire hydrant.
C: GREG
D: Jesus! What happened?!
C: AMY
D: You ruined my life!
N: Amy shows them an INSTAGRAM PHOTO on Jasmine’s account -- it’s a GROUP PHOTO of all the girls and boys at the party. Jasmine is holding up a BABY DOLL.
C: AMY
D: She tagged the baby doll with MY NAME! She’s saying I’m a little kid!
E: CONT’D
C: NICOLE
D: Amy, it’s just one picture-
N: Ding. Ding. Ding.
C: AMY
D: With like a hundred comments! Everyone’s laughing at me!
C: GREG
D: Just cuz they’re typing “LOL” doesn’t mean they’re really laughing out-
C: AMY
D: I’m not talking to you!
C: NICOLE
D: It’s okay, honey. You don’t have to talk to your uncle.
C: AMY
D: I’m not talking to you either.
N: Nicole GASPS. Amy scowls out the window.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - KID’S BEDROOM - LATER
N: It’s now 11:45pm. Randall is lying on the floor, half-asleep.
C: RANDALL
D: ... that’s when Chris Evans tripped on the tesseract... and that shot him back to the year... nineteen...thirty... four...
N: Randall chokes on his own SNORE, jolting himself awake. He checks the boys -- they’re finally asleep. He tiptoes out of the room and into-
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: - where June is already in bed. Randall joins her.
C: RANDALL
D: That took a little longer than last night. What happened? You never came back.
C: JUNE
D: Oh. I figured you had it under control. I mean, we don’t have to do everything together, right?
C: RANDALL
D: Right. Okay good night.
E: hiding his hurt
C: JUNE
D: Good night. Love you.
N: They turn off their bedside lamps and go to bed.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Nicole and Greg lie in bed, wide awake.
C: GREG
D: You really threw me under the bus back there. Then you threw the bus driver out, took the wheel, and backed over me a couple more times.
C: NICOLE
D: What difference does it make? She blamed me too.
C: GREG
D: Yeah, I guess it makes no difference at all. Well... at least Marty’s doing okay. We’re 1 for 2.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - OFFICE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
N: Marty is still awake, completely fixated on the computer screen. We assume he’s on another depraved deep dive into porn. But as the camera turns around, the screen shows he’s actually on a CLIMATE CHANGE DEEP DIVE. Depressing STATISTICS, SOUNDBITES and CLIPS OF ENVIRONMENTAL WUNDERKIND GRETA THUNBERG fly at him off the screen. So much information. All of it bad.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
N: 2:04am. Randall and June are fast asleep. Suddenly, they’re jolted awake, horror-movie style, by Aaron who is standing in their bedroom, completely drenched in pee and pouting.
C: AARON
D: I’m wet. I’m wet. I’m weeeeeet.
C: JUNE
D: It’s okay, sweetie. Everyone has accidents. Ever since I had the kids, I pee a bit every time I sneeze.
C: RANDALL
D: Really? You sneeze a lot.
C: JUNE
D: Okay, should we change the sheets?
C: RANDALL
D: I mean, we don’t have to do everything together, right?
N: Point taken. June leads Aaron out of the bedroom.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - KID’S BEDROOM - LATER
N: June changes the sheets and tucks Aaron into bed.
C: AARON
D: Can you tell me another story?
C: JUNE
D: Oh honey it’s late.
N: Aaron starts LOUDLY WHINING. Worried he might wake up his brother, June relents and starts reading another book.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING
N: It’s 6am when the boys once again wake June and Randall up. This time, it’s a lot less cute.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - A BIT LATER
N: June and Randall serve the boys breakfast. They’re exhausted and barely talking to each other.
C: RANDALL
D: Alright I should probably get ready for work.
C: JUNE
D: Oh, you were gonna go- cuz I was planning on going to the studio today.
C: RANDALL
D: Okay, how do we decide who goes...
N: They look over at the boys who are now hitting each others’ knuckles with spoons.
C: RANDALL
D: And who stays?
E: CONT’D
C: JUNE
D: I’ll go. You stay.
C: RANDALL
D: Oh, so by whoever calls it out first?
C: JUNE
D: And tomorrow I’ll stay home and we’ll just switch off.
C: RANDALL
D: Okay. I’ll stay home with them.
N: Randall looks at the boys who are flinging oatmeal at each other’s open mouths, missing and making a huge mess.
C: RANDALL
D: Actually think I’ll take them out.
E: CONT’D
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Nicole is making omelettes while Greg gets ready for work. They hear AMY making her way downstairs.
C: NICOLE
D: Hey Amy! Making you an eggwhite omelette! I know how you feel about those yolks-
N: Amy enters wearing HOMEMADE JEAN SHORTS and FAR TOO MUCH MAKE- UP. She makes a smoothie while Greg and Nicole huddle.
C: GREG
D: Uhh, what is happening right now? Why’s she dressed like that?
C: NICOLE
D: Why do you think? Jasmine shamed her for being a little kid and now she’s massively overcorrecting.
C: GREG
D: We can’t let her go to school like that. Can we?
C: NICOLE
D: No. Let’s just make her feel supported. Get back on her good side. Amy! You really gave yourself a makeover, huh?
E: overly cheerful
C: GREG
D: Yeah. Really digging the smoky eye. It’s a real chimney sweep look.
N: No response. Greg presses Nicole to keep going.
C: NICOLE
D: But are you sure that it’s “school appropriate”?
C: AMY
D: What’s that supposed to mean?
N: Amy stares at them, seeing through their act.
C: NICOLE
D: Honey, we know you got some flack in that picture, but... this isn’t you.
C: AMY
D: Yes it is. I decide what’s me.
C: GREG
D: I think what Aunt Nicole is trying to say is-
C: AMY
D: ARE YOU TRYING TO CONTROL MY BODY, UNCLE GREG?
C: GREG
D: Uhh, I- No! Never! I can’t even control my body! Look how many times I cut myself shaving this morning!
N: Amy walks out the room. That did not go well.
C: GREG
D: Okay, we’re still 1 for 2.
E: CONT’D
N: Then Marty walks in, still in his pajamas. In the background we can see Amy stealing money out of Greg’s wallet.
C: GREG
D: What’s with you? Why aren’t you dressed for school?
E: CONT’D
C: MARTY
D: I’m not going to school.
C: GREG
D: Why not?
C: MARTY
D: What’s the point? The polar ice caps are melting. The world as we know it is going to wash away.
C: GREG
D: Well as long as schools are still above sea level, you have to go.
C: MARTY
D: Greta Thunberg doesn’t have to go to school.
C: GREG
D: That’s because she’s traveling the globe raising awareness and shaming political leaders.
C: MARTY
D: I want to do that too. I want to join her. Be by her side.
C: NICOLE
D: You know what? If he doesn’t want to go to school today, then I guess he can stay home with me.
E: faux martyr
N: Surprised, Greg leaves the room, shaking his head.
C: NICOLE
D: Marty? Eggwhite omelette?
E: CONT’D
C: MARTY
D: You mean the chicken abortion? You can eat it.
N: Nicole nods, then slides the omelette in the trash.
S: INT. PANCAKE PALACE - LATER
N: As Randall and the boys enter, he proudly presents the place.
C: RANDALL
D: Welcome to the Pancake Palace! Used to take Amy and Marty here all the time.
C: ANDREW
D: Why’d you stop?
C: RANDALL
D: You’d have to ask them. I’m not the one who stopped wanting to. Let’s order French Toast Dippers, huh?! Get the mood back up!
E: sad beat; then
N: The boys grab for the same menu and jostle over it, knocking cutlery to the floor. Randall smiles through it.
C: RANDALL
D: Hey boys, no need to fight over everything. Here, take mine.
E: CONT’D
N: Randall hands Aaron his menu. His eye is extremely swollen.
C: AARON
D: I can’t read the menu cuz of my eye.
C: ANDREW
D: You can’t read at all. Because of your brain.
C: AARON
D: Yes I can!
C: RANDALL
D: If you stop fighting I’ll give you double ice cream!
N: The boys get excited and stop fighting.
C: RANDALL
D: Why’d I start with double ice cream?
E: CONT’D
N: The boys look around at the OTHER RESTAURANT-GOERS.
C: ANDREW
D: HEY! THAT WOMAN LOOKS LIKE THANOS!
N: They start SNAPPING their fingers at the WOMAN.
C: RANDALL
D: Shhhh! No she doesn’t! Okay, she does. But that’s probably a medical condition that makes her look kinda purple. Either way, if you’re gonna say someone looks like Thanos, at least whisper it.
E: looks over at woman
N: Bored and impatient, the boys lie down at the booth. Andrew kicks the table and some sugar packets pop up in the air.
C: ANDREW
D: Hey Aaron, it’s a popcorn skillet!
N: Aaron laughs and then he starts kicking the table too.
C: ANDREW/AARON
D: Popcorn skillet! Popcorn skillet!
N: Randall feels the eyes of OTHER RESTAURANT-GOERS on him.
C: RANDALL
D: Look boys! There’s a climbing structure! Inside a restaurant! Can you believe it?! GO! GO! GO!
N: The boys run off and join the many COUGHING KIDS on the climbing structure. Randall rests his head on the table.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER
N: Nicole enters to find Greg angrily trying to make the bed.
C: NICOLE
D: Do you want to tell me why you’re upset, or do you just want to keep making the bed really badly?
C: GREG
D: Uhh, you let Amy go out on a school night and now she’s dressing like Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver. And you’re letting Marty stay home from school? You’re breaking every rule they gave us!
C: NICOLE
D: You’re the one who let Marty sleep in the computer room!
C: GREG
D: I know! Fine! I’m sorry! This was supposed to be an easy win. The one time I might actually get one over on June. Make her eat shit for a change.
E: sitting down on bed
C: NICOLE
D: Oh god, she didn’t actually make you eat shit as a boy, did she?
C: GREG
D: She did things that cut a lot deeper. Mostly locked me in things.
C: NICOLE
D: I still don’t get why your parents never stopped her.
C: GREG
D: My dad was always traveling for work. And Mom... I don’t really know. It just shows you how good June was at hiding it. And I could never get her back. She was impenetrable.
C: NICOLE
D: That’s a weird thing to say about your sister.
C: GREG
D: Emotionally impenetrable! Nothing gets to her. It’s like she doesn’t feel anything...
S: INT. ART STUDIO - LATER
N: CLOSE ON: JUNE’S SOBBING FACE as she engages in more art therapy. Once again, in front of TWO GIANT CANVASSES (from earlier scene), but this time we actually see what she’s painting -- TWO CHILDHOOD PORTRAITS OF AMY & MARTY. She sifts through the CHILDHOOD MEMORABILIA CHEST, pulling out photos of AMY AND MARTY AT DISNEYLAND, BIRTHDAY PARTIES AT PANCAKE PALACE. She digs further and finds Amy and Marty’s CHILDHOOD ART PROJECTS, and starts frantically pinning up their kid art on the canvasses and painting around it.
S: INT. PANCAKE PALACE - LATER
N: Randall is asleep on the table when he’s jolted awake by the sound of kids shouting “EW!” “GROSS!” He looks up and sees a mass exodus of kids and parents from the climbing structure.
C: RANDALL
D: Hey, what’s going on?
C: RANDOM PARENT
D: Some poor kid just shit themselves at the top of the play area.
C: RANDALL
D: Haha. Oh man, that is the worst.
N: Randall has a sinking feeling as only Andrew returns.
C: RANDALL
D: No. No, no, no, no, no. Where’s your brother?
E: CONT’D
C: ANDREW
D: He’s stuck at the top. He won’t come down. I think he had an accident.
N: Randall swears under his breath, trying to keep his cool.
S: INT. PANCAKE PALACE - CLIMBING STRUCTURE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Randall and Andrew stand at the bottom of the structure, looking up at Aaron who is all the way at the top.
C: RANDALL
D: Aaron? You gotta come down buddy!
C: AARON
D: I can’t move! There’s- aw! There’s more coming out!
C: RANDALL
D: You gotta squeeze, bud! Don’t squeeze out, squeeze in!
N: Randall feels the prying eyes of other parents on him.
C: RANDALL
D: Alright Andrew, you’re gonna have to go up there and bring him down.
E: CONT’D
C: ANDREW
D: I’m not going near him. He pooed.
C: RANDALL
D: I can’t fit in there. It has to be you. This is where you get to shine as the awesome big brother. You know? Really come through when your little brother needs you most. Real Avengers stuff!
N: Andrew sees the Waiter dropping off pancakes.
C: ANDREW
D: Pancakes!
N: Andrew runs back to the table and starts eating. Randall steels himself then starts CONTORTING his body to crawl up the kid-sized openings to get to the top. On the way up, Randall’s LEG SLIPS through a hole in the rope, giving him ROPE BURN. He finally reaches the top and sees Aaron sitting there, looking very embarrassed and upset.
C: RANDALL
D: Hey, it’s okay. This kind of thing happens. There’s a whole expression dedicated to that.
N: Randall spots the only way down: A LARGE SLIDE.
C: RANDALL
D: That’s how we get out of this. We slide.
E: CONT’D
C: AARON
D: I don’t wanna slide on my bum.
C: RANDALL
D: I don’t blame you. Here. I’ll just-
N: Randall positions himself and Aaron at the edge of the slide. He picks Aaron up and holds him in front like a bag of rotting garbage. They slowly slide down together, the whole restaurant watching them.
C: RANDALL
D: Hey, take a picture. It’ll last longer.
E: CONT’D
N: Some people take out their phones and snap pictures.
C: RANDALL
D: I take it back! Please don’t take pictures!
E: CONT’D
N: Randall carries Aaron back to the booth.
C: RANDALL
D: Andrew, let’s go!
E: CONT’D
C: ANDREW
D: I’m still eating.
C: RANDALL
D: Just- we can bring it in the car!
C: ANDREW
D: I’m not eating next to him!
N: Aaron starts crying, embarrassed. Randall struggles to keep his cool.
C: RANDALL
D: Andrew, help me out, dude!
N: Andrew ignores Randall. Finally, Randall GRABS Andrew’s arm and drags him out of the booth. Andrew resists.
C: RANDALL
D: YOU WON’T WALK? FINE!
E: CONT’D
N: Randall picks up Andrew and carries him under his arm, surfboard style. He carries under his other arm. He calls out to the restaurant.
C: RANDALL
D: Just for the record, these aren’t my kids!
E: CONT’D
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Nicole walks out of the bathroom, wearing a towel, post- shower. She’s startled to find Marty, standing right there.
C: NICOLE
D: AHHHHHHH!!! Marty what are you doing?
C: MARTY
D: 16 minutes. That’s how long your shower was.
C: NICOLE
D: Were you... timing me?
C: MARTY
D: Did you know that for every minute in the shower, you use 2.5 gallons of water? You just wasted 40 gallons.
C: NICOLE
D: I wouldn’t say I wasted it.
C: MARTY
D: I bet you left the water running to warm it up.
C: NICOLE
D: I mean, obviously I’m not getting in a cold shower-
C: MARTY
D: What would Greta Thunberg do in this situation? I bet she’d go on a shower strike to make up for all the water you just wasted.
N: Marty walks off. He already smells pretty bad.
C: NICOLE
D: No she wouldn’t, Marty! She’d want to look presentable to the UN! Please, you’re already... so ripe.
N: Nicole continues down the hallway into-
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: - her bedroom. She checks her phone by the bedside table and sees a TEXT from Amy: “Not home for dinner. Going to study group”. Nicole gets a bad feeling...
S: INT. CASH ONLY DRY CLEANING - CONTINUOUS
N: A CASHIER hands Greg his suit. Greg opens his WALLET to pay but it’s empty.
C: GREG
D: Huh. Could’ve sworn I took out cash yesterday...
N: The CASHIER’s heard this before. He takes the suit out of Greg’s hands. Greg gets a bad feeling...
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - LATER
N: Greg and Nicole are pacing in their kitchen.
C: GREG
D: This girl is out of control! She’s stealing from us now?! What the hell does she need $80 for?
C: NICOLE
D: Not for study group. I’ll tell you that much. There is a way to find out.
E: then
C: GREG
D: How?
C: NICOLE
D: These goddamn tweens document every waking moment on social media. They can’t help themselves.
C: GREG
D: Are you suggesting we spy on her?
C: NICOLE
D: Well don’t just come out and say it like that! But yes. Think about it. If we had access to that, we could watch her 24 hours a day if we want.
C: GREG
D: That sounds... intense.
C: NICOLE
D: Maybe it’s time to up the intensity level, Greg! Who knows what this girl is getting up to?
E: defensive MORE
C: NICOLE
D: What if something happens to her? You think June would ever let you live that down? Huh?!
E: CONT'D
C: GREG
D: ALRIGHT LET’S SPY ON HER! How are we gonna do that though? Don’t we need her passwords?
E: triggered
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah...
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - OFFICE - LATER
N: Greg and Nicole stand in front of Marty.
C: MARTY
D: Sure, I can hack her social media.
C: NICOLE
D: Really? Just like that?
C: MARTY
D: Yeah, she’s a dick to me. But obviously I want something in return.
C: NICOLE
D: Like what?
C: MARTY
D: Oh, I’ll make a list.
N: Greg and Nicole agree. Marty starts trying out different passwords. I/E. OLSEN HOUSE - GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON June pulls into the garage, which doubles as her HOME ART STUDIO. She sets up her TWO LARGE CANVASSES, admires them, then enters the house-
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - CONTINUOUS
N: - where she finds the boys on the couch, watching TV. Randall is sitting in a dark room, hunched over and weary.
C: JUNE
D: Hey, how long have they been parked in front of the TV?
C: RANDALL
D: I don’t know. As soon as we got home. Sort of lost track of time.
C: JUNE
D: Jesus. What happened to you?
C: RANDALL
D: What happened to me? Uhhh, they wouldn’t stop fighting, they weren’t listening-
C: JUNE
D: I feel like the trick when they’re not listening is to just not take it personally and to, you know, be present with them.
C: RANDALL
D: Oh I was present. I was present when Aaron shit himself on the climbing structure. I was present when I had to physically carry him down from there. And I was certainly present when I had to wash off the back of his legs in a Chipotle bathroom when three other restaurants wouldn’t let us inside because the boy wasn’t up to code.
C: JUNE
D: Well he seems fine now. Hey, I’m gonna Facetime Greg in a few minutes.
C: RANDALL
D: What? No. Why?
C: JUNE
D: I want to see how our kids are doing. Also, I want to ambush him. Hmm. Maybe we should put some sunglasses on you, you look pretty tired.
E: eyeing Randall
C: RANDALL
D: I’m extremely tired. And this isn’t Weekend at Bernie’s. You can’t just slap some sunglasses and a Hawaiian on me and use me as a prop to pretend everything’s fine.
C: JUNE
D: Oooo, Hawaiian shirts. That’s actually a pretty good idea.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - OFFICE - LATER
N: Greg and Nicole are reading Marty’s LIST.
C: NICOLE
D: No single-use plastic water bottles. Fine. No red meat.
C: GREG
D: No leather. Easy.
C: MARTY
D: What’s your belt made out of?
N: Greg begrudgingly takes off his belt and tosses it.
C: NICOLE
D: Sponsor a polar bear. Is that even possible?
C: GREG
D: Five-minute joint showers. That ones not bad. I could help you-
E: sotto; to Nicole
C: NICOLE
D: I don’t need help washing my boobs. We agree to your terms!
E: sotto; to Greg to Marty
N: Nicole clicks the LOG IN button. They’re in. On Amy’s Instagram feed, they see a DM FROM AMY to Jasmine and her other friends “MANI-PEDIS ON ME!!!!”
C: GREG
D: What the- those mani-pedis are on me! What are all these pig emojis?
C: NICOLE
D: I think that’s her friends squealing in delight.
N: They flip through and find MANY PHOTOS of Amy and her friends getting mani-pedis, smoothies and shopping.
C: NICOLE
D: Study group, my ass. Ya busted.
E: CONT’D
N: Then Greg gets a FACETIME CALL FROM JUNE.
C: GREG
D: Oh god. It’s June!
C: NICOLE
D: Well don’t pick up.
C: GREG
D: I have to! If I don’t, it’ll look like a sign of weakness. She’ll think something is up!
C: NICOLE
D: Something is up. Amy isn’t home. She’s not even supposed to be out on a school night.
C: GREG
D: Well we can’t let June know that! Marty! You know how we’re sponsoring a polar bear? You get us through this call, we’ll get you 10 polar bears. Like a whole polar bear baseball team. Yeah?
E: frantically; to Marty
N: Marty shrugs and nods. Good enough. Greg answers.
C: GREG
D: HELLO HELLO HELLO!!
E: CONT’D
C: JUNE
D: Aloha! Just thought we’d check-in. We’re having a casual Luau night.
E: O.S.
N: ON FACETIME, June, Randall, and the boys are all dressed in Hawaiian shirts and sunglasses, looking like a happy family.
C: GREG
D: Looking very casual and not remotely staged.
C: ANDREW/AARON
D: HI MOM!! HI DAD!!
C: NICOLE
D: How are you boys doing?
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT. OLSENS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

C: AARON
D: Having the best time ever!
C: ANDREW
D: Aunt June and Uncle Randall are the best!
C: AARON
D: We love it here!
C: ANDREW
D: We don’t want to leave!
N: Under the table, we see June rewarding each nice comment with a Hershey’s Kiss.
C: JUNE
D: Boys that’s so- wow!
C: ANDREW
D: Having the best time ever!
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah... you already said that, hun.
N: Aaron drops his chocolate and bends down to get them. His sunglasses fall off his face, revealing his BLACK EYE. June recovers the sunglasses and puts them on his face before he’s back in frame. Close call.
C: GREG
D: Randall’s being a little quiet. Hey Randall! How’s it really going?
C: RANDALL
D: You know. It’s... a lot. - of fun! A lot of fun. Otherwise why would I be wearing this shirt?
E: off June’s death stare
C: JUNE
D: Alright enough about us, where’s Amy and Marty?
C: GREG
D: Marty’s right here, I think Amy’s in her room. Let me just get her.
N: Greg gets up and hands Marty the phone.
C: RANDALL
D: Hey buddy! How’s it going?
N: Greg scrambles around the kitchen behind the phone, looking for a pen and paper. He settles on the boys’ dry erase board and starts writing talking points: “ALL IS WELL.”
C: MARTY
D: All is well.
N: But it sounds more like Marty is stiffly reading a prepared hostage statement.
C: RANDALL
D: Ah. Okay. How was school today?
N: Marty freezes. Greg furiously writes: “LIE!!!”
C: MARTY
D: I went to school. I was there the whole day.
C: RANDALL
D: K, you’re not really giving us a lot here. Is that it?
N: Nicole looks out the window and sees Amy approaching. She mouths: “She’s back!” Greg gives Marty the “stretch it out” gesture to buy more time. Marty’s confused.
C: MARTY
D: We... made pizza dough?
C: JUNE
D: What?
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah apparently it was make-you-own- pizza day at school. Hey look who’s out of her room!
E: then
N: Amy enters. Greg takes the phone back and is about to point it at Amy. He notices the inappropriate outfit she’s wearing and throws the phone to the ground.
C: GREG
D: Whoops! Dropped the phone.
N: Greg “struggles” to pick it up, waiting for Amy to enter her room. SLAM! He picks it up, pointing it at the closed door.
C: GREG
D: And there she goes back in her room. That’s teenage life for ya.
E: CONT’D
C: JUNE
D: Open the door, we want to see her.
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah, we actually like to respect her privacy. It’s a trust thing, you understand.
N: Nicole sees that her laptop is still open to Amy’s Instagram, and quickly shuts it. Greg knocks on Amy’s door.
C: GREG
D: Hey Amy, we just need a quick proof- of-life.
C: AMY
D: I’m alive.
E: O.S.
C: GREG
D: There you have it! Alive and happy. No one’s tapping out over here.
C: JUNE
D: No one’s tapping out on this end either.
C: GREG
D: Great. Glad to hear it. Bye boys!
N: Greg hangs up the phone and starts hyperventilating. I/E. YOUNG HOUSE - AMY’S ROOM - SOON AFTER Nicole and Greg knock and slowly open the door.
C: NICOLE
D: So... how was study group?
C: AMY
D: Fine.
C: GREG
D: Yeah? What were you guys studying?
C: AMY
D: Covalent bonds.
C: NICOLE
D: Mmmm, love those. What did you learn about them?
C: AMY
D: That they’re stronger than... common bonds.
N: A beat. Greg and Nicole look at each other, unsure.
C: GREG
D: Right. Yeah, way stronger.
E: covering
C: NICOLE
D: Your nails look really pretty.
C: AMY
D: Thanks. Jasmine did them. Can you guys leave me alone now please?
N: They slink off, apologetically, closing the door behind them.
C: NICOLE
D: You didn’t confront her.
C: GREG
D: Neither did you.
C: NICOLE
D: I chickened out. I think I’m afraid of her.
C: GREG
D: Me too. Common bonds? Is that even a thing? It isn’t!
E: then looks it up on phone
C: NICOLE
D: God, if we were just a little smarter we could have called her on it. Now it’s too late.
C: GREG
D: I hate physics!
C: NICOLE
D: Chemistry.
C: GREG
D: Whatever! I hate school!
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF NIGHT
N: Randall and June are awoken by a STRANGE BARKING SOUND.
C: JUNE
D: What is that? Did our neighbors get a pet seal?
C: RANDALL
D: Oh god. It’s coming from the boys’ room. I think it’s a cough.
C: JUNE
D: It sounds like croup.
N: More barking coughs. This time on top of each other.
C: RANDALL
D: This is getting ridiculous! We can’t do this anymore!
N: June takes out her phone and starts checking WebMD.
C: JUNE
D: Yes we can! Says here the best home treatment is to take your child outside to get cold air into their lungs. We can handle this.
S: EXT. OLSEN HOUSE - BACKYARD - SOON AFTER
N: Randall and June are outside in their PJs, shivering, holding the two coughing boys. June wears oven mitts and turns her face away, to keep the germs at bay.
C: RANDALL
D: I’m s-s-so c-c-cold.
N: Aaron turns his head and coughs in Randall’s face.
C: RANDALL
D: Ah! He got me! I swallowed it!
E: CONT’D
N: The Boys laugh which only makes them cough harder.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
N: The alarm beeps. Randall and June wake up after another sleepless night. Randall starts COUGHING and SNEEZING.
C: RANDALL
D: Oh god. I think I’m sick. Everything hurts.
N: MORE COUGHS from the other room. Randall’s eyes suddenly widen and he rolls out of bed to feebly get dressed for work.
C: JUNE
D: You’re still going in to work?
C: RANDALL
D: No way I’m staying here... What? I can’t take this many sick days in a row.
E: off June’s look
C: JUNE
D: But you’re actually sick. Seems like you shouldn’t be going in if you’re feeling this bad.
C: RANDALL
D: Right. Are you saying that out of concern for me? Or concern for yourself, having to deal with two sick kids all day.
C: JUNE
D: Concern for you. I’ll be fine.
C: RANDALL
D: Then so will I.
N: Randall ties his tie, sneezes on it, then has to change it.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING
N: Nicole is showering at breakneck speed.
C: NICOLE
D: She’s a sociopath. She lied right to my face, like a little teenaged Robert Durst.
C: GREG
D: But worse...
E: O.S.
N: REVEAL Greg is huddled in the corner of the shower, not getting any of the warm water.
C: GREG
D: ... even Durst had a tell: the burping. Amy didn’t even blink, let alone burp.
E: CONT’D
C: NICOLE
D: At least when the boys lie, I know it. Shuffling their feet, evading eye contact. God, I miss the way they lie.
C: GREG
D: So do I. So simple, so sweet. I hate to admit it, but June was right. Kids get older, they get smart, and then they use those smarts to manipulate you-
N: BANG! BANG! BANG! Greg and Nicole, clutch each other, cowering at the sound of banging on the door.
C: MARTY
D: That’s five minutes!!
E: O.S.
N: Nicole scrambles to turn off the shower.
C: NICOLE
D: It’s off, Marty!
N: Greg still has soap suds all over him.
C: NICOLE
D: This kid’s going to school today.
E: CONT’D
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - KID’S BEDROOM - MORNING
N: June opens the door and pokes her head inside their room.
C: JUNE
D: Alright boys. Who’s ready for fun?
N: The boys COUGH and SNEEZE. They look disgusting. This is not going to be a fun day. QUICK CUTS OF JUNE DEALING WITH NEEDY KIDS: - She feeds the boys breakfast. They’re sneezing all over their food and the table. June tries to hide her disgust.
C: ANDREW
D: I can’t taste my fruit loops.
N: Andrew WHINES. June moves in to console him but pats him on the back instead. Then she promptly washes her hands. - The boys get up from the breakfast table, wiping their snotty hands on everything. June follows behind, SANITIZING everything they touch. - Andrew builds a LEGO tower. He sneezes and his hand topples the structure. Frustrated, he starts WHINING and purposely THROWING his Lego across the room. Before she can go help Andrew, she hears a cry from the bathroom:
C: AARON
D: Aunt Juuune! I’m done! I need a wipe!
E: O.S.
N: - This devolves into a series of COUGHS, SNEEZES and WHINEY CRIES FOR “AUNT JUNE”. We can see the unrelenting need and the overall grossness is getting to her.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: June holds out TWO BANDANAS in front of the boys. She’s also wearing one to cover her nose and mouth.
C: JUNE
D: Who wants to play a fun game of Bandits?
C: AARON
D: What’s a bandit?
C: JUNE
D: Bandits were robbers. They didn’t care about the law, didn’t care about the rules. The only thing they cared about was wearing bandanas over their mouths and noses at all times. No matter what.
N: June starts tying bandanas around the boys’ faces, careful to avoid any airborne germs.
C: AARON
D: How do we play?
C: JUNE
D: Well, bandits LOVED robbing trains. So, let’s say this couch is a train. And you don’t want to leave the train because that’s where the loot is.
C: ANDREW
D: I don’t get it. What’s the loot?
C: JUNE
D: Avengers cartoons. Now binge! Binge the loot! Don’t get off the train!
E: turning on the show
N: June ducks into the Garage/Art Studio and closes the door.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - GARAGE / ART STUDIO - CONTINUOUS
N: June takes off her mask and takes a deep breath, relieved. She hears more COUGHING and puts in some EAR BUDS to drown it out with music. Then she focuses on her TWO ART PIECES.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER
N: Greg is about to head out to work. Nicole is at the table.
C: GREG
D: Alright, I have a 4:00, so I’ll see you after dinner. Love you.
N: Nicole doesn’t even react, completely fixated on her laptop.
C: GREG
D: Nicole?
E: CONT’D
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah, sure, salmon for dinner.
E: not listening
N: The laptop is open to AMY’S INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK and TIK TOK.
C: GREG
D: Whoa. You’ve gone full Homeland.
C: NICOLE
D: She’s already posted three videos and changed her status twice in the last hour. Ohh! Jasmine just started another group chat! Looks like someone’s planning on skipping 5th period.
E: then
N: Greg loosens his tie and sits down next to Nicole.
C: GREG
D: I can get Malcolm to cover for me at work. This is more important. Should I put on a pot of coffee?
C: NICOLE
D: Marty threw away all our beans. Apparently, they aren’t “ethical” enough? He wants fair trade.
C: GREG
D: Fair trade. I’m starting to think this kid swap wasn’t a fair trade.
S: INT. OFFICE BUILDING - LATER
N: Randall walks down the hallway, shivering and trying to stifle his sneezing. He manages to avoid his CO-WORKERS and sneak into his office where he curls up on his couch to rest. Just as he settles in, there’s a KNOCK on his office door.
C: RANDALL’S BOSS
D: Are you sick? You know you’re not supposed to be here if you are.
N: Busted. Randall gets up from the couch, disappointed.
C: RANDALL
D: K, I’ll go home and sleep it off.
S: INT. PARKING LOT - RANDALL’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
N: Randall lies uncomfortably in the back seat of his car, using his suit jacket as a blanket. He shivers himself to sleep.
S: INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Marty walks the halls: plastic water bottles everywhere, a TEACHER throwing stacks of paper into the garbage instead of the recycle bin.
S: INT. SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - SOON AFTER
N: In line, Marty sees all the styrofoam containers and food waste. A STUDENT throws some trash in an overflowing garbage can. It falls to the floor. Fed up, Marty grabs the garbage can, climbs on a table, and DUMPS THE GARBAGE ON THE CAFETERIA FLOOR. Everyone turns to the commotion.
C: MARTY
D: Oh, so when it’s a big enough mess you do notice! Well we’re in a mess. The whole world is a mess. And it’s up to us to clean it up! Our parents, our teachers, our uncles, our aunts just want to sweep it all under the rug and pretend everything’s okay. How DARE YOU! You have stolen our futures! And we’re going to do something about it! WE’RE WALKING OUT!!
N: Marty gets down from the table with purpose. Then notices that no one is following him.
C: MARTY
D: Well don’t just stand there, drinking out of your single-use plastic water bottles.
E: CONT’D
N: CLONK! Marty gets struck in the head with a half-full water bottle. Then another. Then another. Marty ducks out of the cafeteria as water bottles rain down on him.
C: MARTY
D: Really? Nobody? Ow!
E: CONT’D
N: On the way out, Marty spots a FIRE ALARM. He pulls the lever. All the students start rushing for the exits.
C: MARTY
D: There’s your goddamn walk-out!
E: CONT’D

N: The camera turns to Amy, who’s filming the video.
C: AMY
D: We’re all gonna look like Halsey!
N: They all cheer!
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Greg and Nicole stare at the laptop, in horror. I/E. MINIVAN - MOMENTS LATER Nicole PEELS OUT of the driveway, driving erratically.
C: GREG
D: We cannot let this girl put a hole in her face while she’s under our care!
N: PING! Greg clicks on the latest video of all the girls singing Halsey’s “Eastside”.
C: GREG
D: It’s a clue! They’re getting pierced on the east side of town.
E: CONT’D
C: NICOLE
D: Just- play it back! Landmarks! Street signs!
N: Greg plays the video back, PAUSES ON A STREET SIGN.
C: GREG

N: The OWNER steps forward, furious.
C: OWNER
D: What are you doing?!
C: GREG
D: Sorry about your cheek, sir. Ugh, that looks bad.
C: AMY
D: Uncle Greg?
N: Amy steps out and Greg rushes over, inspecting her nose.
C: GREG
D: Oh thank god. It’s still intact.
C: AMY
D: What are you- how did you know I was here?
N: Greg and Nicole look to each other, unsure what to say.
C: NICOLE
D: We were at the Build-a-Bear station. Building bears. And then saw you here. Happy accident.
N: Jasmine gleefully takes a video of the whole scene and posts it online. Amy’s phone PINGS. So does Nicole’s. Amy snatches Nicole’s phone, and sees her Instagram profile up.
C: AMY
D: You hacked me?!
C: NICOLE
D: You know what... yes we did. Yes. We. Did. And I’m glad we did! Cuz you are OUT OF CONTROL!
C: AMY
D: I can’t believe I ever said you were cool. You are so much worse than my parents!
C: NICOLE
D: Take that back!
C: AMY
D: No!
C: NICOLE
D: Oh yeah?! You wanna see me be worse than your parents? How’s this?! Greg! Grab her!
C: GREG
D: What are you, The Penguin? Why are you ordering me to do it?
N: Nicole grabs Amy’s arms and starts DRAGGING HER OUT OF THE STORE. Amy resists. Greg reluctantly helps, grabbing Amy’s legs. They carry her away as Amy thrashes.
C: AMY
D: Ahhhh! I’m being abducted! These aren’t my parents!
C: GREG
D: We’re related though!
N: Greg and Nicole hurry past SEVERAL BYSTANDERS.
C: NICOLE
D: It’s kind of disturbing how nobody’s trying to help her.

N: June stands back and admires her completed art pieces.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: June exits her studio, a little shocked to find the boys aren’t on the couch. No sign of them anywhere.
C: JUNE
D: Uhhh, boys?
N: She then hears footsteps and coughing coming from upstairs.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER
N: She reaches the landing. All the upstairs CUPBOARDS AND DRAWERS ARE OPEN. The house looks like its been robbed. She looks into her bedroom, and sees Andrew - still wearing the bandana over his face - stuffing jewelry into his pillow case. He sees her and stops in his tracks.
C: ANDREW
D: It’s the Sheriff! Hide the loot!
N: Andrew slams the door on her, LOCKING IT.
C: JUNE
D: No! I’m not the Sheriff! I’m a fellow bandit! Andrew, open the door, please.
E: banging on door
N: June is exasperated but keeps her emotions in check.
C: JUNE
D: I bet you can’t open it by the count of three. One. Two. Three.
E: CONT’D nothing
C: See? I was right.
D: Please don’t cough on my things.
E: then; a bit panicked
N: Behind June, Aaron tiptoes down the stairs, holding his own full pillow case.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - GARAGE / ART STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER
N: Aaron looks for a place to hide his loot. He spots a KILN, curiously, starts tinkering with the dials and knobs.
C: JUNE
D: AARON! Are you hiding? Come out, come out, wherever you are.
E: O.S.
N: Aaron hides his pillow case inside the kiln.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS
N: June sees her bedroom doorknob has a pin-hole in the middle. She runs her fingers on the top of the door frame, searching for the pin to open the door. Nothing there.
C: JUNE
D: Andrew, can you at least cough on Uncle Randall’s side of the bed?
N: As she rushes to the bathroom and searches for a bobby-pin, she suddenly catches a whiff of something in the air.
C: JUNE
D: Is- is something burning?
E: CONT’D
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
N: June bounds down the stairs sees SMOKE coming out from under her ART STUDIO DOOR. June looks around, panicked.
C: JUNE
D: Aaron!? Where are you?!
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - ART STUDIO - CONTINUOUS
N: June opens the door. THE KILN IS ON FIRE! The flames have spread and her two ART PIECES are engulfed!
C: JUNE
D: Oh my god-
N: June grabs a FIRE EXTINGUISHER and sprays the Kiln and the art pieces, managing to put out the fire. The smoke clears and June stares at the CHARRED REMAINS of her children’s art. In shock, she opens the kiln and finds a burnt pillow case inside. Andrew and Aaron stand in the doorway.
C: AARON
D: I... just wanted to hide my loot.
C: JUNE
D: You... just wanted... to hide... your loot.
N: June finally SNAPS.
C: JUNE
D: AHHHHHHHHHHH!!
E: CONT’D
N: Aaron is so terrified, he starts crying. Then Andrew. June realizes her screams are making the kids cry, so she stops. After a beat, she can’t help herself and screams again:
C: JUNE
D: AHHHHHHHHHH!!!
E: CONT’D
N: Andrew and Aaron run away from the room, scared.
S: EXT. MINIVAN - LATER
N: Nicole, Greg and Amy drive in silence. As they pull up to the house, they find Marty sitting on the stoop, upset.
C: NICOLE
D: Why are you home from school?
C: MARTY
D: I... just wanted people to listen.
C: GREG
D: That’s the scariest thing you could have said.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER
N: Greg and Nicole pace in their room.
C: GREG
D: I can’t believe he got suspended.
C: NICOLE
D: I can. Preachy little shit. I do feel responsible though. He’s really upset.
E: beat
C: GREG
D: Not as upset as Amy.
C: NICOLE
D: Seems like they’re a lot worse off now than before we became their guardians.
N: Greg sits on side of the bed, shell-shocked.
C: GREG
D: I wanted to beat June so bad that I never really thought about the impact it was having on their lives. She’s just always made me feel like such a loser... and, you know what, she’s right. I am a loser.
E: then
C: NICOLE
D: No you’re not. Don’t say that.
C: GREG
D: Why? It’s true. I’m a failure. I’m a failure at home - I barely get to spend time with the kids and when I do, they don’t respect me or even listen to me.
C: NICOLE
D: They don’t listen to anybody. And you’re not a failure at home.
E: MORE
C: NICOLE
D: You’re a good father who loves his kids and is doing his best.
E: CONT'D
C: GREG
D: Well I’m a failure at work. You gave up your job and it was on me to take care of the business and look how well that turned out. Like, you wonder why I had such a hard time accepting help from you - it’s because it just reminded me how I couldn’t hold up my end. I just wanted to get the kids into preschool for you.
E: beat; ashamed
N: Greg feels the full weight of his failure.
C: NICOLE
D: Honestly, maybe it’s for the best that the kids stay home. I mean, this week I had time to myself and I didn’t even know what to do with it. I jumped right back into mom mode. But maybe that’s just my role and it’s fine. The kids are just my life now.
E: resigned
C: GREG
D: That can’t be your only role. You deserve a life outside of them too.
N: Nicole gets emotional.
C: NICOLE
D: I wonder what they’re doing right now. I miss them.
C: GREG
D: Remember how you could hug them after a hard day and it would make everything alright in that moment?
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah.
N: Greg and Nicole inch closer and hug each other.
C: NICOLE
D: It’s not the same.
E: CONT’D
C: GREG
D: Not even close.
N: I/E. OLSENS HOUSE - LATER Randall returns, sick and exhausted. He sees the boys on the couch, watching TV, and feels vindicated. Then he hears some movement in the garage and heads there.
S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - GARAGE/ART STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER
C: RANDALL
D: So, how long have the boys been parked in front of the- OH MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED HERE?!
E: noticing fire damage
N: Randall surveys the damage around the room. He then spots June on her knees, huddled in the corner. Before he can unleash a tirade, he notices there’s TEARS IN HER EYES.
C: RANDALL
D: You’re crying. What did these kids do to you?
E: CONT’D taken aback beat
C: JUNE
D: It’s not them. It’s them.
N: June picks up some charred pieces of Amy and Marty’s kid art. Randall gets on his knees and joins her.
C: JUNE
D: It’s like they’re not even kids anymore. They don’t need us. They don’t even want us around.
E: CONT’D
N: As June breaks down, Randall is overwhelmed, realizing that June feels the exact same way as him.
C: RANDALL
D: I had no idea you felt this way.
C: JUNE
D: My childhood was cut so short. And it kills me to know that theirs is ending. They’re growing up so fast. I just wish I could make it stop.
C: RANDALL
D: Maybe that’s the problem. We can’t stop them from growing up. It’s happening whether we like it or not.
N: Randall’s eyes drift to some of the charred kid art pieces.
C: RANDALL
D: This is Marty’s. He made this for me for Father’s Day. And those are Amy’s hippogriffs. What were you doing with these?
E: CONT’D
C: JUNE
D: Oh you know. Trying to hold onto a time that I can never get back.
N: Randall sees the burnt canvasses, realizes what June was working on.
C: RANDALL
D: It burning to ashes at your feet really drives that point home.
C: JUNE
D: It was a pointless endeavor. Kinda like this whole week.
C: RANDALL
D: I wouldn’t say that. At least the two of us got to spend some time together.
C: JUNE
D: That’s true. I had a lot of fun with you. At least for the first 36 hours.
C: RANDALL
D: Amy and Marty are gonna drift away from us. That’s what kids do. I just don’t want us to drift away from each other.
C: JUNE
D: Neither do I.
N: They hug each other on the floor. Then they hear Andrew and Aaron yelling in the other room.
C: JUNE
D: Ugh. These kids are the worst.
E: CONT’D
C: RANDALL
D: Thank you so much for finally admitting that.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING
N: Greg stares at the phone in his hand.
C: NICOLE
D: Okay, you’re holding the phone. That’s step one. Now, just call your sister, and tell her we’re tapping out.
C: GREG
D: Okay. 3. 1. 0. That’s the area code-
E: stalling
N: Fed up, Nicole grabs the phone, and starts dialing. The phone rings. Then they hear the sound of a PHONE RINGING coming from their front porch. I/E. YOUNG HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER Greg opens the door. Andrew and Aaron barrel past him, and jump all over Nicole, kissing her like faithful dogs. She hugs them tight.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh! My boys! I missed you so much!
N: Greg watches their reunion, feeling left out. Then the boys run over to hug him too. He scoops them up, happy to have them back. Then, June and Randall enter, looking very run down.
C: GREG
D: Well, well, well... look who finally caved.
C: JUNE
D: I just got a phone call from you, what was that about?
C: GREG
D: Just a butt dial. You two look like shit, by the way.
C: NICOLE
D: Did you boys have fun destroying your aunt and uncle?
N: Nicole rubs Aaron’s cheek and some MAKE-UP comes off.
C: NICOLE
D: What’s on your face?
E: CONT’D
N: Nicole rubs off more make-up revealing AARON’S BLACK EYE.
C: NICOLE
D: Wha- what happened to your eye?
E: CONT’D
C: JUNE
D: It’s nothing, just a little bump.
C: AARON
D: They set up a boxing ring for us to fight in and Andrew knocked me out!
C: RANDALL
D: Not “out”, just down.
C: GREG
D: You sanctioned a fight between them?
C: ANDREW
D: And they let us watch as many shows as we wanted! Way more than you guys!
N: Greg and Nicole look at June and Randall, smugly.
C: GREG
D: Really? Way more than us, you say?
N: June is stewing, not used to being on the receiving end of criticism. Especially from her little brother.
C: RANDALL
D: It’s okay. Let’s just take our lumps. It’s gonna be fine.
E: quietly to June
C: AARON
D: We were also in a fire!
C: GREG / NICOLE
D: WHAT?!?!
C: RANDALL
D: In fairness... I wasn’t there for that one. June?
C: JUNE
D: Everything was fine! No one got hurt!
C: NICOLE
D: Well any insecurities I had about being a bad parent have completely gone away.
C: GREG
D: I couldn’t agree more. And based on the fact that you showed up on our doorstep, and not the other way around, it’s fair to say we just won the kid swap. Which means you lose! Wouldn’t you agree, June?
E: to June
N: Everyone’s eyes, including Randall’s, are on June who’s mustering up the courage to admit she lost. Then-
C: MARTY
D: Mom? Dad?
E: O.S.
N: June and Randall pull Marty in for a hug. They recoil.
C: RANDALL
D: Oof. Buddy. You’re not smelling the freshest.
C: MARTY
D: I’ve been on a shower strike to protest the over-consumption of water in this house.
C: JUNE
D: Okay. Where did you get an idea like that?
N: Marty looks over at Greg and Nicole, unsure what to say.
C: MARTY
D: I’m not supposed to say...
C: GREG
D: Well you’re not supposed to say that either. He may have picked up a few little ideas... online.
E: to June and Randall
C: RANDALL
D: Online? You gave him internet access?
C: MARTY
D: They let me sleep in the computer room.
N: June and Randall stare angrily at Greg and Nicole.
C: GREG
D: We have a small house! Where were we supposed to put him?
C: RANDALL
D: You take the computer out of the room.
C: NICOLE GREG
D: Yup. We should’ve done that. He’s a good negotiator!
C: MARTY
D: Am I in trouble?
C: JUNE
D: No, honey, whatever happened this week isn’t your fault. It’s theirs.
C: MARTY
D: Okay good. Cuz I also got suspended from school.
C: RANDALL
D: WHAT?!
C: JUNE
D: Wow. You knew he was suspended and yet you still tried to pretend like you were the winner. That’s sad.
E: shaking her head; Greg
C: RANDALL
D: Where’s Amy? This kid swap is over!
N: June and Randall storm down the hallway.
C: MARTY
D: Wow. You guys really called it that, huh?
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: June and Randall knock on the door.
C: JUNE
D: Amy, honey? We’re leaving!
N: They open the door. The room is empty.
C: RANDALL
D: Where is she?
N: Greg and Nicole are just as confused.
C: GREG
D: Uhhhh. She was here last night. Have you seen her?
E: to Nicole
C: RANDALL
D: You’re asking each other?!
C: JUNE
D: Oh my god. You don’t know where she is...
N: All the air suddenly leaves the room.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - VARIOUS - MOMENTS LATER
N: PANIC MODE as everyone searches the house, frantically and tries calling Amy’s phone, to no avail.
C: RANDALL
D: I just called the school. She’s not there.
C: JUNE
D: When did you last see her?
C: NICOLE
D: Yesterday? Around 4?
C: JUNE
D: She didn’t come out of her room after that?
C: GREG
D: She was upset with us.
C: RANDALL
D: What did you do?
C: GREG
D: We hacked her social media. We hacked her social media! We can track her using that!
E: suddenly hopeful
N: Nicole scrambles for her phone and tries logging into Amy’s Instagram. Password denied.
C: NICOLE
D: Nevermind, she changed her password.
C: RANDALL
D: Where would she go?!
N: Everyone thinks about this and reaches the same conclusion.
C: GREG/NICOLE JUNE/RANDALL
D: Jasmine’s. Jasmine’s.
S: EXT. JASMINE’S HOUSE - LATER

C: XANDER
D: Hey.
C: NICOLE
D: Hi Xander.
N: June and Randall look confused as to how Nicole knows him.
C: NICOLE
D: We’re looking for Amy. Again. Is she here?
E: CONT’D
C: XANDER
D: Yeah, she slept here last night. Think she’s in the basement. Yo Amy!
E: calling out
N: The parents all breathe a HUGE SIGH OF RELIEF.
C: XANDER
D: Oh wait. What time is it? My bad. They left hours ago.
E: CONT’D
C: RANDALL
D: Left?! To where?
S: INT. MINIVAN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Both families are now piled into the minivan. The mood is very tense as they pull onto the I-10: Gridlock. Randall checks his phone.
C: RANDALL
D: Shit. It’s red for the next, uhhh... Until Coachella.
C: JUNE
D: Ohh Amy, please be okay...
C: AMY
D: WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
E: PRE-LAP
S: EXT. COCHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - DAY
N: Amy and her friends are celebrating in line. They’re all decked out in wild Coachella outfits, slathered in glitter, beads in their hair. Jasmine hands out WRISTBANDS.
C: JASMINE
D: My dad got us VIP wristbands! We basically have the same access as the Hadids.
C: AMY & FRIENDS
D: WOOOOO!!!!!
N: Amy’s phone buzzes. She sees dozens of MISSED CALLS AND TEXTS from all the parents. She ignores it and puts her phone away.
S: INT. MINIVAN - MUCH LATER
N: They’re still stuck in traffic. Marty sits in the back between the boys, playing video games. The boys watch.

D: She’s not answering any of my texts.
C: NICOLE
D: Me either.
N: The parents sit in tense silence for a moment.
C: NICOLE
D: We can’t even tell you how sorry we are.
E: CONT’D
N: Greg is almost too ashamed to speak. He catches June’s gaze in the rearview and casts his eyes down.
C: GREG
D: We thought this would be so easy. It’s like every decision we made this week made everything worse. We embarrassed her, violated her trust. We basically drove her to do this.
N: Greg braces himself for a lecture from June.
C: JUNE
D: She came to us about Coachella last week. And we shut it down too hard. So this isn’t all on you.
N: Greg and Nicole are surprised to be let off the hook.
C: NICOLE
D: Teenagers. Right?
N: They sit in silent agreement, some of the tension released.
S: INT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - VIP TENT - LATER
N: Jasmine leads Amy and her friends inside. She spots her father RAUL, hobnobbing with VIPs. She runs up and hugs him.

E: to Jasmine
C: JASMINE

N: The girls SQUEAL with delight. They excitedly walk over to JAKE PAUL, who standing over by a table full of SHOTS.
C: JAKE PAUL
D: Hey girls, wanna do some shots?
C: GIRLS
D: OKAY!!!
N: Amy tries to hide her nervousness. This is all a little much.
C: AMY
D: Yeah! Cool.
S: EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - LATER
N: Greg hands out WRISTBANDS to the group. He turns to Nicole.
C: GREG
D: Maybe the fact that the ticket prices were the exact amount as our credit card limit means it was meant to be?
N: The families enter the Festival, scanning the SEA OF FESTIVAL GOERS.
C: RANDALL
D: AMY!!!!
N: THREE RANDOM GIRLS in the vicinity turn and reply “Yeah?”.
C: RANDALL
D: Okay. We need a better plan than that. Where do we start?
E: CONT’D
C: JUNE
D: Amy said Jasmine’s stupid father would get them VIP access. Let’s start there.
C: GREG
D: Shit, that’s on the complete opposite side of the grounds.
N: Andrew and Aaron already look tired and hot.
C: NICOLE
D: These boys are looking tired. They need fuel.
S: EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - COTTON CANDY STAND - LATER
N: Nicole hands the boys COTTON CANDY. They’re thrilled.
C: NICOLE
D: You guys need to eat these as fast as you can. Eat!

S: INT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - VIP TENT - VARIOUS
N: RAPID FIRE SEQUENCE OF THE GIRLS DOING SHOTS AND DANCING WITH JAKE PAUL, which abruptly ends with:
C: JAKE PAUL
D: Wait- how old are you girls?
C: AMY
D: 13.
C: JASMINE
D: 13 and a half.
C: JAKE PAUL
D: Wow. All of us almost made a HUGE mistake.
N: Jake Paul abruptly scurries off.
C: JASMINE
D: Whatever, let’s do more shots.
N: Jasmine hands out more shots. Amy looks at hers, starts to feel a little woozy.
C: AMY I don’t really...
D: ...want... this party to stop!
E: off Jasmine’s look
N: She gags the shot down. Then Jasmine grabs her hand and they run out of the tent.
C: JASMINE
D: Let’s go find some glow in the dark shit!
N: As they run towards the EDM TENT, Amy looks overwhelmed by all the COACHELLA WEIRDOS.
S: INT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - EDM TENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jasmine and Friends are dancing in the middle of a raucous crowd. It’s insane. Amy is swaying uncomfortably, trying to fit in, but she keeps getting bumped around by much larger, sweatier people. She gets knocked back so hard that she’s SEPARATED FROM HER FRIENDS.
C: AMY
D: Jasmine! Christie! Gwen!
N: Overwhelmed, Amy takes out her phone and sees MISSED CALLS from Nicole and her Mom and Dad. She tries to call June but gets bumped again, KNOCKING THE PHONE OUT OF HER HANDS. I/E. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - VIP AREA - LATER The VIP tent is guarded by TWO SECURITY GUARDS. The families peer inside and see Jasmine’s Father, RAUL in the back.
C: JUNE
D: There’s Jasmine’s dad!
N: Randall and June approach the Security Guards.
C: RANDALL
D: Hey guys. This is sort of an emergency. A 13-year-old girl is missing and we need to question that man.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: VIP only.
C: JUNE
D: Right. But here’s the thing-
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Are you VIP?
C: RANDALL
D: Not technically, but-
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Do you know what a choke-slam is?
N: Randall nods, understanding. They walk back to the family.
C: JUNE
D: The security guards are mean. We’re not getting in without wristbands.
N: Andrew and Aaron can barely stand still, full of sugar and vibrating like two little crackheads.
C: GREG
D: Here’s our wristbands. Boys, you know how me and mom are always telling you to stop running around and acting wild?
E: gets to Boy’s level
C: ANDREW
D: Yeah.
C: GREG
D: Well today... is Opposite Day.
N: The boys cheer!
C: AARON
D: I hate you Dad.
N: Greg is momentarily horrified, then decodes the message. He pulls them in for hugs.
C: GREG
D: I hate you too. With all my heart. Now GO!
N: Greg sends the boys running. I/E. VIP TENT - MOMENTS LATER The boys run into the VIP area right past the Security Guards, who leave their post to chase after them. June and Randall use this distraction to sneak into the VIP area. They make a beeline for Raul, tap him on the shoulder.
C: JUNE
D: You’re Jasmine’s father.
C: RAUL
D: I’m sorry, do I know you?
C: JUNE
D: No, because you haven’t been to a single school function or even been at your own house since I’ve known your daughter.
C: RANDALL
D: We’re Amy’s parents. Do you know where she is?
C: RAUL
D: Listening to music somewhere? It’s a music festival. Lighten up.
C: JUNE
D: We can’t lighten up! Because of parents like you, who make responsible parents like us, look like we’re the bad guys. You’re the bad guy, guy.
C: RAUL
D: Not to my daughter, I’m not. Or your daughter for that matter. I’m giving them a VIP experience at Coachella. I’m a goddamn hero.
N: June and Randall are stewing. Raul smirks at Randall.
C: RAUL
D: What are you gonna do? You gonna hit me? In front of Scooter Braun?
E: CONT’D
C: RANDALL
D: No.
N: Randall SNEEZES into Raul’s mouth. Raul recoils.
C: RAUL
D: AH WHAT THE HELL?!
C: JUNE
D: You know what? I’ll hit you in front of Scooter Braun.
N: June PUNCHES Raul in the face right in front of a scandalized SCOOTER BRAUN.
S: EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - JAIL - LATER
N: June, Randall, Greg, Nicole, Marty, Andrew and Aaron are tossed in music festival jail, which is really just a tent with some folding chairs and ONE RENT-A-COP.
C: RANDALL
D: I hope Amy’s okay.
C: JUNE
D: You know what? She hasn’t even tried to contact us. Maybe Jasmine’s father’s right and she’s just having a good time and doesn’t need us.
N: A solemn beat. Then, they’re distracted by another CELLMATE berating a SECURITY GUARD:
C: GIRL
D: Do you even know who my dad is?!
E: O.S. drunkenly slurring
C: NICOLE
D: Ugh, the people at this music festival are so obnoxious. Wait, that’s Jasmine.
E: noticing
N: They turn to see Jasmine, who has VOMIT all down her shirt.
C: JUNE
D: Ugh. Did you puke glitter?
C: JASMINE
D: A little. My outfit’s ruined.
E: sobbing
N: Gwen and Christie are also there, clearly wasted.
C: JUNE
D: Jasmine, where is Amy?
C: JASMINE
D: She’s right here- - oh, wait. She’s not. Weird.
E: realizing
N: Jasmine burps and then slinks to the ground to sleep.
C: JUNE
D: Wait, don’t pass out yet! Where did you last see her?
N: Jasmine manages a WEAK EDM CLUB BEAT and closes her eyes.
C: RANDALL
D: What the hell was that?
C: MARTY
D: Was that an “oonts”? Were you doing a house beat?
N: Jasmine weakly holds a thumbs up.
C: MARTY
D: Is she in the EDM tent?
E: CONT’D
N: No response.
C: MARTY
D: Roll your tongue out of your mouth if the answer’s “yes”.
E: CONT’D
N: A tense beat as they all stare at Jasmine’s face. Then, her tongue lazily rolls out the side of her mouth. Hope springs!
C: RANDALL
D: EDM tent! We have to get out of here!
C: GREG
D: We can’t. We’re stuck in music festival jail.
N: They look around the tent, noticing that everyone else in jail is either heavily intoxicated or having a bad drug trip. The STAFF is paying a lot more attention to those people.
C: JUNE
D: Are we?
S: EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - JAIL - MOMENTS LATER
N: The Families simply walk out of the tent. June spots the EDM tent across the grounds.
C: JUNE
D: I’m thinking the EDM tent probably isn’t the best place for the kids.
C: GREG
D: We’ll watch them. You guys go.
N: June and Randall run to the EDM TENT.
S: INT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - EDM TENT - SOON AFTER
N: June and Randall are instantly overwhelmed. The music is extremely loud and it’s nearly pitch black, except for some seizure-inducing laser lights. They inch their way through the packed crowd. It’s near impossible to make out faces without getting uncomfortably close to people. They try futilely yelling for Amy but the music is way too loud.
C: RANDALL
D: I CAN’T SEE ANYTHING!
C: JUNE
D: HUH?!
C: RANDALL
D: DO YOU SEE HER ANYWHERE?!
C: JUNE
D: I CAN’T HEAR ANYTHING!
N: Randall gets an idea. He takes out his phone and pulls up a PICTURE OF AMY. He shows it to NEARBY RAVERS.
C: RANDALL
D: HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL?!
N: FROM RAVER’S POV: the phone is leaving trippy light trails. The Ravers are mesmerized, following the phone’s movement with their eyes and heads as they dance along with it. Suddenly, the music gets a LITTLE QUIETER.
C: JUNE
D: Oh thank god. At least we can hear each other now.
C: RANDALL
D: No... I think this is just the slow build. We only have fifteen seconds before this place goes insane!
C: JUNE
D: There’s too many dancing idiots! We’re never gonna find her!
N: THE MUSIC STEADILY BUILDS. June scans the crowd, then sees a GIANT LEVER beside the stage.
C: JUNE
D: There! Come on!
E: CONT’D
N: June and Randall fight their way to the stage as the MUSIC BUILDS, nearing its crescendo. THE CROWD IS READY TO EXPLODE.
C: RANDALL
D: Outta my way, you goddamn millennials!
N: THE SECOND BEFORE THE BEAT DROPS, June reaches the Lever and flips it up. THE BRIGHT HOUSE LIGHTS TURN ON AND THE ENTIRE CROWD SHIELDS THEIR EYES, BLINDED. The DJ stops the music. Everyone in the crowd stumbles around, disoriented and agitated. June and Randall scan the crowd and find Amy balled up in the corner of the tent, alone and scared. She spots her parents and a flood of relief washes over her. Amy rushes over, latching onto them tight, crying.
C: AMY
D: I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have come here.
C: JUNE
D: It’s okay. It’s okay.
C: AMY
D: I don’t know what I was thinking. I just wanna go home.
N: Randall and June share a poignant look. She still needs them after all.
S: EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - EDM TENT - SOON AFTER
N: Randall, June and Amy reunite with the rest of the family. Nicole and Greg hug Amy, relieved that she’s safe. Marty goes in for a hug, but is met with a punch to the shoulder.
C: MARTY
D: Guess I deserved that.
C: JUNE
D: Amy, come on. Be nice to him.
C: GREG
D: Really? You’re gonna give her a hard time for that? After what you put me through growing up?
C: JUNE
D: What I put you through?
C: GREG
D: Uhhh, yeah. Like, my seventh birthday? When you locked me in my toy chest for hours. I still have nightmares about it.
C: JUNE
D: Yeah? So do I.
N: OFF Greg’S CONFUSION--
S: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
N: We FLASHBACK to the first scene of the movie, only this time it’s shown from JUNE’S POV.
C: JUNE
D: Okay. When I close this, you need to count to five but most importantly, you need to believe.
N: Greg nods and June closes the toy chest. She then rushes to the door and pokes her head out to the hallway. Her MOTHER is pacing on the phone, YELLING and THROWING things at the wall.
C: MOTHER
D: GOOD! CUZ I HATE YOU TOO! YOU
C: SELFISH PIECE OF SHIT!
D: OH! YOU DON’T WANT TO BE HERE?! NEITHER DO I! YOU’RE FORCING ME TO RAISE THEM BY MYSELF!
E: beat
N: Scared, June shuts the door, unsure what to do.
C: GREG
D: Nothing’s happening! I’m just getting hot.
E: O.S.
C: JUNE
D: Weird! Maybe try to believe more!
N: She hears more SCREAMING and GLASS SHATTERING from the other room and turns on the stereo and turns it to full blast to drown out the sound. She sits down on the toy chest and starts to cry.
C: GREG
D: JUNE! LET ME OUT! JUNE!
E: O.S.
S: EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - EDM TENT - CONTINUOUS
N: BACK TO JUNE.
C: JUNE
D: And it wasn’t hours, it was more like 20 minutes... or however long it took for mom to run out of breath.
N: Greg struggles to process this new information.
C: GREG
D: ... what about the time you made me stay in the dog house all afternoon?
C: JUNE
D: Right. Dog Day Afternoon. Mom accused Dad of cheating when he was in Hong Kong. That was a bad one.
C: GREG
D: Well that doesn’t explain why you made me eat all those dog treats.
C: JUNE
D: I didn’t. You did that on your own, I assume because you like the taste of dog treats.
C: GREG
D: ... shit...
C: JUNE
D: Pretty dumb that we’re competing over who’s the better parent when both of us are way better than mom and dad ever were.
C: GREG
D: Seriously. You really think I’m a good parent?
E: then
C: JUNE
D: Of course I do.
N: Greg hugs June almost he has no control of it. Her approval clearly means a lot to him.
C: JUNE
D: Should we try to find you some more dog treats? There’s probably a kiosk here somewhere.
E: CONT’D
N: Randall then catches Marty staring at a GROUP OF ATTRACTIVE HIPPIE GIRLS, dancing.
C: RANDALL
D: The boy’s growing up.
N: Then Randall sees what Marty is actually staring at: beyond the girls is a KIOSK devoted to ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHES.
C: RANDALL
D: You wanna go take a look?
E: CONT’D
C: MARTY
D: Really?
C: RANDALL
D: Yeah, you obviously discovered some new things this week that you care about.
C: JUNE
D: Maybe you’re not too young to learn that the world isn’t perfect.
N: Marty smiles, as Randall and June escort him to the kiosk. We stay with Greg and Nicole.
C: GREG
D: So... you wanna head out soon?
C: NICOLE
D: Considering we spent all our money on this festival, I feel like we should get our money’s worth.
S: EXT. COACHELLA MUSIC FESTIVAL - VARIOUS - LATER
N: OVER A DA BABY TRACK, WE SEE: - Amy and Marty bring June and Randall to the main stage where Da Baby is performing.
C: JUNE
D: Yeesh. Someone needs to wash Da Baby’s mouth out with soap.
N: - Greg and Nicole dance with Andrew and Aaron, swinging them in the air, having fun. - Randall, June, Greg and Nicole all lie on their stomachs getting HENNA TATTOO TRAMP STAMPS as their kids look on. - The families walk toward the exit gates at sunset. The parents all wear Coachella crop tops, exposing the small of their backs where the words “COACHELLA” are written in Henna. DING DING DING! The sound of a BELL ringing.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
N: REVEAL Andrew and Aaron in INFLATABLE SUMO SUITS. Greg and Nicole (DRESSED IN WORK CLOTHES) cheer as the boys collide, harmlessly bouncing off each other. Nicole checks her phone.
C: NICOLE
D: Alright, I should head out. I have a showing.
N: Aaron jumps on Andrew, pinning him.
C: NICOLE
D: Whoa! Look at Aaron!
E: CONT’D
C: GREG
D: I paid Andrew to go down in the third round. And he actually listened.
E: proudly
N: They kiss. This dynamic seems a lot healthier.
S: INT. PANCAKE PALACE - DAY
N: We follow a PACK OF SINGING WAITERS with short-stack pancake hats carrying a BIRTHDAY CAKE. They place it in front of AMY, who now has a NOSE RING, which looks slightly infected. She’s sitting at a table with June, Randall and Marty. She blows out the candles and everyone claps.
C: JUNE
D: Your nose is looking a lot less red today.
C: AMY
D: Why’d you let me get this thing?
C: RANDALL
D: Because you’re old enough to make your own decisions. And live with the painful consequences.
N: Beside them, a YOUNG KID in the next booth starts having a tantrum and has to be carried out of the restaurant, surf- board style. Randall and June smile, happy to not be dealing with that bullshit anymore. Life is good.
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Greg, Nicole and the boys lie in bed together, cuddling and finishing a proper Avengers book together.
C: ANDREW
D: Can we have one more story?
N: Greg and Nicole look at each other, happy to be back in the routine. They open another book. The boys rest their heads on their parents’ shoulders, while Greg and Nicole enthusiastically read to them.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: It’s HALLOWEEN! Packs of kids trick-or-treating in costume. Among them, we see Andrew and Aaron dressed as THOR and CAPTAIN AMERICA. Marty is dressed as AL GORE, holding a GREEN BAG. Amy is understandably absent and with her friends. The kids get their candy and run back to June, Randall, Greg and Nicole - who we reveal are all dressed like HARVEY WEINSTEIN (large pillows in their belly, gross stubble on their faces, all pushing walkers).
C: JUNE
D: I don’t see why we all agreed to do this. We already did the henna thing.
C: NICOLE
D: This was your idea!
C: RANDALL
D: Yeah, I’m getting a lot of bad looks in this costume.
C: GREG
D: Whatever. It’s not like we’re celebrating the guy.
C: JUNE
D: Then why are you carrying around two Academy Awards?
C: GREG
D: For context. Plus I had them left over from the year I dressed as Roberto Benigni. Remember when I jumped on those tables and hurt my hip?
N: Some parents walk by and give them all disgusted looks.
C: RANDALL
D: Sorry. We all lost a Kid Swap.
N: As they slink away as a family, we pull back to reveal we're in one of those crane shots that ends movies.
