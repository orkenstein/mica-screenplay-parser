N: A 7-year-old boy, GREG YOUNG, pops out of bed, excited. He
N: runs to his desk, grabs a pencil, then marks his height on
N: the wall.
0: 
N: He hears some LOUD NOISES down the hall. Curious, he creeps
N: towards the door when suddenly, his 10 year old sister, JUNE,
N: BURSTS into his room and shuts the door with urgency!

C:                     GREG
D:           What are you doing?
0: 
C:                     JUNE
D:           You have to listen to me. This is
D:           serious. I’m only telling you this
D:           because you’re seven now and you’re
D:           old enough to know the truth.
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           Okay...
0: 
C:                     JUNE
E:               (pointing)
D:           That’s not what you think it is.
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           My toy chest?
0: 
C:                     JUNE
D:           It’s actually... a portal.
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           Pfft. No way.
E:               (then; curious)
D:           To where?
0: 
N: June starts dumping all the toys out of the chest.
0: 
C:                     JUNE
D:           I’ve only used it once and it took
D:           me to the North Pole. Maybe it goes
D:           other places too - I only know for
D:           sure it goes there.
0: 
N: Greg stares at the toy chest, his heart pounding. Then he
N: runs to his CLOSET.
0: 
C:                     JUNE (CONT’D)
D:           What are you doing?
0: 
N: Greg pulls out a WINTER COAT.

C:                     GREG
D:           It’s the North Pole.
0: 
C:                     JUNE
D:           Duh! Wish I had thought of that
D:           when I went. Now hurry!
0: 
N: Greg quickly climbs into the toy chest.
0: 
C:                     JUNE (CONT’D)
D:           Okay. When I close this, you need
D:           to count to five but most
D:           importantly, you need to believe.
0: 
N: Greg nods and June closes the toy chest. WE STAY IN GREG’S
N: POV INSIDE THE DARK AND CONFINING TOY CHEST.
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           Nothing’s happening! I’m just
D:           getting hot.
0: 
C:                     JUNE (O.S.)
D:           Weird! Maybe try to believe more!
0: 
N: Greg tries again. Nothing. Frustrated, he tries to push open
N: the toy chest only to realize he’s locked in. He starts
N: POUNDING to get out but it’s no use. He panics.
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           JUNE! LET ME OUT! JUNE!
0: 
N: Then the Offspring’s “Keep Em Separated” starts BLARING AT
N: FULL BLAST. It’s torture. Greg bangs on the lid like he’s
N: trying to get out of a coffin. His SCREAMS MORPH into the
N: SCREAM OF AN ADULT-

0: 
N: GREG (now in his 30s) wakes up SCREAMING, in a cold sweat.
N: His wife NICOLE (30s), who is sleeping face-to-face with him,
N: is startled awake and screams right in his face:
0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           AHHHHH!! Seriously?! Again?
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           Sorry. I can’t control my mind when
D:           I sleep. I’m not Freddy Krueger.
0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           Freddy controlled other people’s
D:           minds when they slept, not his own.
D:           I don’t even think he slept.

N: 3:02am. They both groan, trying to get back to sleep. Then-

C:                      AARON (O.S.)
D:           I’m wet.
0: 
C:                      GREG/NICOLE
D:           AHHHHH!!
0: 
N: Their 4-year-old AARON is standing at the foot of their bed,
N: horror-movie style. Nicole rolls over.
0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           I did it last time.
0: 
N: Greg GROANS and gets up.

S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BOYS’ BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
0: 
N: Greg, half-asleep, strips the sheets, and flips the mattress -
N: - there are pee stains everywhere.
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           This mattress looks like a
D:           giraffe’s neck.

C:                     AARON
D:           Can we go to the zoo tomorrow?

C:                     GREG
E:               (tucking Aaron in)
D:           No. Go back to sleep.

C:                     AARON
D:           I’m thirsty.
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           That’s how we got into this mess in
D:           the first place. Love you.

S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER
0: 
N: It’s 4:01am. Greg and Nicole are fast asleep again.
0: 
C:                     ANDREW (O.S.)
D:           I had a bad dream.
0: 
N: Their other son, ANDREW (5) is now standing by their bed.
0: 
C:                     ANDREW (CONT’D)
D:           Can I sleep with you?
0: 
N: Andrew climbs in bed and clings onto his mom.
0: 0:                                                          4.

0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           Can you move over a bit? And maybe
D:           loosen the choke-hold?
0: 
C:                     ANDREW
D:           No. The Chupacabra will eat my
D:           feet.
0: 
N: Andrew gets in a position where he’s splayed across the bed,
N: clinging to Nicole with his feet kicking Greg’s back. Neither
N: of them will be sleeping tonight.

0: 
S: INT. YOUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - MORNING
0: 
N: The house is a mess. Chipped paint and magic markers on
N: walls, scratches on floors, toys everywhere. Greg and Nicole
N: look utterly exhausted as they prepare breakfast, clean-up
N: after the boys, fold laundry, etc. Once the plates are on the
N: table, Greg sits down to review PAPERWORK.
0: 
C:                     ANDREW
D:           3-2-1! THE FLOOR IS LAVA!
0: 
N: Andrew and Aaron dive onto the couch and climb on furniture,
N: knocking over Nicole’s neat laundry piles.
0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           Awww come on, man. My piles.
0: 
C:                     AARON
D:           The floor was lava.
0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           Greg, you want to attempt to be
D:           useful here?
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           Boys. Food’s on the table. Eat.
0: 
N: The boys ignore him and continue playing. Greg looks at her -
N: he tried.
0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           Okay, you have 5 seconds to get to
D:           the table or you never get to eat
D:           breakfast again.
0: 
C:                     ANDREW
D:           Race you to the table!
0: 
N: The boys race to the table and knock over a cup of milk. Some
N: of it SPILLS on Greg’s paperwork. He quickly grabs them.
0: 0:                                                          5.

C:                     GREG
D:           NO! My inspection report- Do you
D:           see what you did?!
0: 
C:                     ANDREW
D:           Yeah.
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           Do you even care?!
0: 
N: They don’t. Frustrated, Greg pins the dripping papers up on
N: the fridge with an OLD FRIDGE MAGNET (that features a much
N: younger Greg and Nicole as real estate partners).
0: 
C:                     AARON
D:           Mom. Can I have more milk?
0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           There isn’t any more.
0: 
C:                     AARON
D:           BUT I WANT MILK!
0: 
N: Nicole sees Aaron is on the brink of tears and
N: enthusiastically tries a different tact.
0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           Boys! This is math! Aaron had 1
D:           milk, then he lost 1 milk, so now
D:           there’s 0 milk. But what if Aaron
D:           had 2 milks, and then spilled just
D:           1 of them? Then how many milks
D:           would Aaron have left?
0: 
C:                     AARON
E:               (bursting out in tears)
D:           I waaaaaant miiiiiilk!
0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           Ugh. We really need to get these
D:           guys into pre-school. They’re not
D:           learning anything here.
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           Do you not see me working on it?
0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           I didn’t mean it like that.
0: 
N: This is a touchy subject. The moment is interrupted by Andrew
N: teasing Aaron which then escalates to PUSHING AND FIGHTING.
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           No closed fists! Slappers only!
0: 0:                                                          6.

0: 
N: They roll on the ground, wrestling.
0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           Guys! GUYS! If you’re gonna roll on
D:           the floor at least roll over the
D:           milk and help me out.
0: 
C:                     ANDREW
D:           Ahhhhh! Aaron bit me!
0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           STOP FIGHTING EACH OTHER! WHY WON’T
D:           YOU JUST LISTEN?!
0: 
N: Both boys cry harder after being yelled at. At the peak of
N: the stress level, Greg announces:
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           You know what, I’m gonna print
D:           these at the office. See you
D:           tonight. Love you!
0: 
N: Greg’s out the door before Nicole can even respond. Numb to
N: the boys’ crying, she starts cleaning up the spill.

S: INT. OLSEN HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
0: 
N: JUNE OLSEN (40s, Greg’s sister from the flashback) lays in
N: bed, staring up at the ceiling. She looks troubled. Her
N: husband RANDALL (40s) sleeps beside her. She gets up.

N: June and Randall sit across from each other at the breakfast
N: table, reading the newspaper, not engaging in conversation.
N: Their son, MARTY (11) joins them.

C:                     MARTY
D:           Oh. They evacuated Ventura County.
D:           Wildfires are getting closer.
0: 
N: June and Randall look at each other, confused, then realize
N: Marty read the headline from the back of the newspaper he’s
N: holding. Randall folds the paper and tucks it away.

C:                     MARTY
D:           We’re affected by the air quality.

D:           You don’t have to worry about stuff
D:           like air, honey. You’re young and
D:           healthy.

0: 
C:                     RANDALL
D:           Fine. We’re healthier than horses.
D:           Hey, how about you go play some
D:           video games, huh?

0: 
C:                     RANDALL
D:           Coachella. I guess we could rent an
D:           RV and go camping in Joshua tree-
0: 
C:                     AMY
D:           Not with you. With my friends.
D:           Jasmine’s Dad is a concert
D:           promoter, he can get us VIP passes.

D:           for Christmas?
0: 
C:                     RANDALL
D:           I guess getting your daughter cool
D:           things but never actually being
D:           around makes you father-of-the-year

D:           Yes.

D:           Port-o-pottys! We’ll get the set

0: 
C:                     MARTY
D:           Pretty good. We had a lock-down
D:           drill yesterday and it was our best
D:           time yet, so hopefully that will

D:           Guys, seriously. We’re at someone
D:           else’s house right now. I need you
D:           to just listen to me-
0: 
N: Aaron SQUAWKS right in Greg’s face and continues playing. No
N: respect. Greg rejoins the table and June smirks at him.

D:           kids. They’re not bothering

0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           Well if it doesn’t bother you, it
D:           doesn’t bother me.
0:

0: 
C:                     JUNE
D:           Thanks. I laid some plastic down on
D:           the soil before planting to warm it
D:           up. And I always use red mulch...
0: 
N: Greg nods, pretending to listen. But all he can focus on is
N: the boys making noise. Again, he gets up from the table.
0: 
C:                     JUNE (O.C.) (CONT’D)
D:           Tomatoes love heat and the mulch
D:           really helps to retain the moisture
D:           in the soil...
0: 
N: Greg walks to the boys, offers them an iPad. This time they
N: comply and quietly enter the house. Back at the table, June
N: has clocked this transaction.

D:           Huh. So that’s what mulch does.
D:           Never really thought that mulch
D:           about much-
E:               (correcting)
D:           - that much about mulch.
0: 
N: June and Nicole laugh, both buzzed. Greg returns to the
N: table. And June gives him the slightest of shit-eating grins.

D:           What?

D:           Nothing. Just an interesting time

D:           your goal was to reinforce the
D:           exact behavior you were trying to

E:               (defensive)

D:           that I set, and I achieved it.
0: 
C:                     JUNE
D:           Relax! I was just joking.
0: 
C:                       GREG
D:           So was I.

D:           Did my parents send me here because

0:

D:           Every time I try to talk to them
D:           about something important they just
D:           change the subject. Like one time I
D:           asked about Nazi Germany and my dad
D:           just put on a bunch of David
D:           Hasselhoff music videos and danced

D:           aren’t talking about it. At least

0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           No! What? You shouldn’t have to
D:           hide anything from your parents.
D:           It’s not your fault for asking
D:           those questions. It’s their fault
D:           for not answering them. They’re,
D:           like, not doing their job.

D:           Look, your parents just want to

D:           I’m your uncle and if you wanna
D:           worry about depressing stuff around

0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           That’s a whole chicken and egg
D:           situation. Full disclosure, I’m not
D:           exactly a Middle East expert, but
D:           I’d say the real reason for all the
D:           bloodshed? It’s the heat. You can’t

E:               (then)
D:           It’s just, if you moved those two
D:           chairs over here, you can turn this
D:           area into a nice reading space.

E:               (proudly)
D:           And he actually listened.

S: INT. PANCAKE PALACE - DAY
0: 
N: We follow a PACK OF SINGING WAITERS with short-stack pancake
N: hats carrying a BIRTHDAY CAKE. They place it in front of AMY,
N: who now has a NOSE RING, which looks slightly infected. She’s
N: sitting at a table with June, Randall and Marty. She blows
N: out the candles and everyone claps.

C:                     JUNE
D:           Your nose is looking a lot less red
D:           today.
0: 
C:                     AMY
D:           Why’d you let me get this thing?
0: 
C:                     RANDALL
D:           Because you’re old enough to make
D:           your own decisions. And live with
D:           the painful consequences.
0: 
N: Beside them, a YOUNG KID in the next booth starts having a
N: tantrum and has to be carried out of the restaurant, surf-
N: board style. Randall and June smile, happy to not be dealing
N: with that bullshit anymore. Life is good.

C:                     ANDREW
D:           Can we have one more story?
0: 
N: Greg and Nicole look at each other, happy to be back in the
N: routine. They open another book.

S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
0: 
N: It’s HALLOWEEN! Packs of kids trick-or-treating in costume.
N: Among them, we see Andrew and Aaron dressed as THOR and
N: CAPTAIN AMERICA. Marty is dressed as AL GORE, holding a GREEN
N: BAG. Amy is understandably absent and with her friends.
0: 
N: The kids get their candy and run back to June, Randall, Greg
N: and Nicole - who we reveal are all dressed like HARVEY
N: WEINSTEIN (large pillows in their belly, gross stubble on
N: their faces, all pushing walkers).

C:                     JUNE
D:           I don’t see why we all agreed to do
D:           this. We already did the henna
D:           thing.
0: 
C:                     NICOLE
D:           This was your idea!
0: 
C:                     RANDALL
D:           Yeah, I’m getting a lot of bad
D:           looks in this costume.
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           Whatever. It’s not like we’re
D:           celebrating the guy.

C:                     JUNE
D:           Then why are you carrying around
D:           two Academy Awards?
0: 
C:                     GREG
D:           For context. Plus I had them left
D:           over from the year I dressed as
D:           Roberto Benigni. Remember when I
D:           jumped on those tables and hurt my
D:           hip?
0: 
N: Some parents walk by and give them all disgusted looks.
0: 
C:                     RANDALL
D:           Sorry. We all lost a Kid Swap.
0: 
N: As they slink away as a family, we pull back to reveal we're
N: in one of those crane shots that ends movies.
