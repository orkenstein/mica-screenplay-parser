S: EXT. FARMERS’ MARKET - DAY - FLASHBACK
0: 
N: OVER the sexy, lively beat of a modern TANGO, Gotan Project’s
N: “Santa Maria,” we OPEN ON --
0: 
N: A colorful, busy outdoor market in urban New Jersey -- stalls
N: teeming with white corn, red tomatoes, Italian sausage.
0: 
N: Find CAROLINA (40, Latinx), hair loose, dressed in colors as
N: vibrant as the local fruit, humming and moving like the
N: dancer she is to the TANGO in her earphones.
0: 
N: SUPER: TWO YEARS AGO
0: 
N: The VENDOR (male, 60s) smiles at her -- who wouldn’t at this
N: gorgeous woman on this gorgeous day?
0: 
C:                     CAROLINA
D:           What’s good today?
0: 
C:                      VENDOR
E:               (Jersey accent)
D:           Everyt’ing, sweetheart. Don’t
D:           insult me.
0: 
N: Carolina laughs. She spots a magnificent Jersey peach and
N: gleefully reaches for it just as --
0: 
N: Another hand, a man’s, does the same. CLOSE ON the two hands
N: as they hover over the treasure, unwilling to give it up.
0: 
N: She looks up. The hand belongs to an impossibly handsome man,
N: clothes and hair the kind of casual meant to fool the world
N: of their expense. This is DAMIAN (40s, white). He’s saying
N: something. She pulls off her earphones (MUSIC fades).
0: 
C:                     CAROLINA
D:           Sorry, what?
0: 
C:                     DAMIAN
D:           I said, pardon me -- ladies first.
0: 
C:                        CAROLINA
D:           Really?
0: 
C:                     DAMIAN
D:           No. You’re gonna have to fight me
D:           for it.
0: 
N: Carolina laughs in surprise. He smiles back. It’s a friendly,
N: slightly flirty exchange between two beautiful strangers.

C:                     CAROLINA
D:           I tell you what. You let me have
D:           this peach, and I’ll let you take
D:           first crack at those plums over
D:           there.
0: 
C:                     DAMIAN
D:           Over where? Is this a trick?
0: 
C:                     CAROLINA
D:           Here, I’ll show you --
0: 
N: They take a few steps toward the next stand when --
0: 
N: BOOM!
0: 
N: A massive cement slab CRASHES down from the sky on the spot
N: where they were just standing!
0: 
N: Carolina SCREAMS. She instinctively grabs Damian, who
N: instinctively throws his arms around her.
0: 
N: They both look up to see where it came from: construction
N: work going on in the tall building overhead. Nobody’s hurt,
N: but everyone is shouting and running around: the construction
N: WORKERS, the VENDORS, the SHOPPERS. Mayhem.
0: 
N: Damian and Carolina suddenly realize they’re still embracing
N: and back awkwardly apart. Both are shaken to the core.
0: 
C:                     DAMIAN
D:           Are you okay?
0: 
C:                     CAROLINA
D:           Oh my God. Yeah. Are you?
0: 
N: He nods. They stare at the cement slab.
0: 
C:                     CAROLINA (CONT'D)
D:           We could’ve -- we would’ve -- been
D:           killed.
0: 
N: Carolina crosses herself and kisses the Virgin Mary medallion
N: around her neck. Then, her knees go weak. She wobbles. Damian
N: takes her arm.
0: 
C:                     DAMIAN
D:           Do you need to sit down?
0: 
C:                     CAROLINA
D:           What I really need is a drink.

S: EXT. RIVERFRONT BAR - DAY - FLASHBACK
0: 
N: Carolina and Damian sit at an outdoor bar beside the Hudson
N: River, the Manhattan skyline shimmering across its waters,
N: jazz on the sound system. BARTENDER sets down a fresh tequila
N: on ice before Carolina and takes away an empty one.
0: 
C:                     BARTENDER
E:               (to Damian)
D:           Still good with just the seltzer?
0: 
N: Damian nods. Carolina’s good and buzzed already. He’s sober,
N: but charmed by her; she’s adorable when drunk.
0: 
C:                     CAROLINA
D:           Just so you know, I’m not a regular
D:           day-drinker.
0: 
C:                     DAMIAN
D:           It’s not a regular day. So, you
D:           were saying --
0: 
N: They resume the kind of emotionally honest conversation you
N: can only have with a total stranger, especially after a brush
N: with death.
0: 
C:                     CAROLINA
D:           Oh, yeah, so, my question was -- if
D:           we had died today. If this had been
D:           your last day on God’s green earth.
E:               (takes a swig)
D:           Did you live the life you wanted?
0: 
C:                     DAMIAN
D:           Yes. No. In some ways. You?
0: 
C:                     CAROLINA
D:           Yes. No. In some ways.
0: 
N: They smile at each other and hold the gaze. There’s the
N: slightest buzzing sound -- or is there? Is it the growing
N: electricity between them?
0: 
C:                     DAMIAN
D:           Maybe this was a warning.
0: 
C:                      CAROLINA
D:           Of what?
0: 
C:                     DAMIAN
D:           Not a warning. More like -- an
D:           alarm. A wake-up call.
0: 0:                                                             4.

0: 
C:                     CAROLINA
D:           To, like, what’s it -- car-pay...
0: 
C:                     DAMIAN
D:           Carpe diem. Exactly. To live life --
D:           truly live.
0: 
C:                     CAROLINA
D:           And what kind of life would that
D:           be? For you.
0: 
N: Their eyes lock again. Something’s happening here, and both
N: know it. Like some transcendental force pulling them closer.
0: 
C:                     DAMIAN
D:           You know what? We don’t even know
D:           each other’s names.
0: 
N: Carolina looks down at their hands, almost touching on the
N: table. He looks down too. CLOSE ON her wedding ring and his.
0: 
C:                     CAROLINA
D:           Maybe it’s best we keep it that
D:           way.
0: 
N: They look deep into each other’s eyes. The attraction between
N: them is so palpable now that it’s like a living thing. The
N: MUSIC and tension swell and it’s unbearable and we --
0: 
N: SMASH TO --

S: INT. CLOSET - DAY - FLASHBACK
0: 
N: Frenzied sex inside a closet! They ravage each other standing
N: up in the tight, dark space, dress hoiked, hair grabbed,
N: pants around knees. CLOSE CUTS of groping, thrusting,
N: groaning. Both climax, panting hard.

S: INT. DESIGN STUDIO - DAY - FLASHBACK
0: 
N: The closet door opens. Damian exits first, tucking in his
N: shirt. Behind him, out steps not Carolina, but --
0: 
N: RAQUEL (40s, Asian) -- Damian’s wife. She’s smoothing her
N: sleek bob and pencil skirt and adjusting her heels, looking
N: impeccably professional, even now. How would an Asian Gwyneth
N: Paltrow look, post-wild sex in a closet? That’s Raquel.
0: 
N: REVEAL we’re in a lobby whose walls are covered with blown-up
N: articles and ads of Damian and Raquel, a famous home-design
N: married couple.

D:           -- but I sure needed that.
0: 
N: Raquel pulls him in for a kiss. She remembers something.
0: 
C:                     RAQUEL (CONT'D)
D:           Oh. You were starting to tell me
D:           something happened this morning.
D:           Are you okay, honey?
0: 
N: It’s a tender moment; she’s genuinely worried. She strokes
N: his face, and he puts his arms around her.
0: 
C:                     DAMIAN
D:           Oh, yeah -- it was the craziest
D:           thing. I was at the market and --

D:           Raquel! There you are --

E:               (to Raquel)
D:           I’ve been looking all over for you.
D:           Target called and they need a rush
D:           on that new line of centerpiece
D:           bowls --

C:                     RAQUEL
D:           What? That’s ridiculous, I told
D:           them we can’t deliver for three
D:           months, Damian hasn’t even started
D:           that design yet --
E:               (to Damian)
D:           Babe, can you put the pedal to the
D:           metal on that?
0: 
N: And just like that, Raquel is swept away into the work day.

N: Damian sighs as he steps into the open, loft-like workspace.
N: WORKERS cross, carrying armfuls of textiles, raffia, color
N: wheels.

N: sheet. Uninspired, he spins to look out the window.

N: MATCH SOUND TO SIRENS as an unmarked, tan Crown Victoria
N: pulls up behind two police cars, an ambulance and a
N: firetruck. We’re on the side of a winding, woodsy mountain
N: road with a steep drop on one side. No buildings in sight.
0: 
N: SANTIAGO (40, Latinx) gets out, talking on his cell. Probing
N: eyes, dogged manner, a pronounced scar on his face. Former
N: NYPD; now a well-liked and decorated detective in the ‘burbs.

D:           egg. Don’t sweat it -- I’ll be
D:           there.

N: Santiago hangs up as another unmarked cop car pulls up. This
N: is EDIE (30s, Black), Santiago’s partner. He taught her
N: everything he knows, but she’s got her own style. If Santiago
N: is a pitbull, Edie’s a cat: calm, watchful. Suffers no fools.
0: 
N: She gets out of her car, sees Santiago and shakes her head.
N: STAY on them as they make their way down the steep slope.
N: Their rapport is easy, familiar, a bond forged in part by
N: being the only two non-whites in the Sheriff’s department.

N: A cherry-red sports car has run off the road and is squashed

D:           Car crash. Single vehicle,
D:           untrafficked road, late night.
D:           Tragic, ‘cause no way the driver

N: Damian’s very much alive face, peering intently at something.
0: 
N: He’s standing in the empty hallway of Everton Academy, its
N: expensive private-school status signaled by its classic
N: architecture and the “EA” crest prominent on a wall.
0: 
N: Damian is staring into a trophy case. Inside is a framed
N: portrait of himself as a teenager, holding a huge trophy,
N: beaming like the world would never tell him no. Damian gazes
N: wistfully at his younger self. Whatever happened to that guy?

D:           What do you mean, you can’t make

0: 
N: He’s only heard it once before in his entire life, but Damian
N: would know that voice anywhere. He turns.
0: 
N: It’s Carolina, on the phone. She’s dressed modestly, her hair
N: up in a neat knot, her face contorted in fury at whoever
N: she’s talking to -- but she takes his breath away.

C:                     PRINCIPAL BERNARD
D:           Let me make this clear. We have a

N: Lola exhales. Mia sulks. Carolina looks at Damian with

E:               (to Mia and Lola)
D:           This is the first offense for both
D:           of you, so it won’t go on your

D:           off. And that is not a suggestion.

0: 
N: Carolina feels a flash of hot guilt. Truth is she’s been
N: thinking plenty about being with Damian, so she covers by
N: overcompensating. She grabs Santiago’s face with both hands.
