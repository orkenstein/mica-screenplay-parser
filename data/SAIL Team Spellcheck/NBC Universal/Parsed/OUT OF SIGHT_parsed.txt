C: R
D: eyes of the TOUGH CUSTOMERS following them as she turns the corner, pulls over within view of THE OCEAN. She parks, turns the car off, turns to look at Jack. A long beat of silence.
C: ZA
D: In their looks, we sense the three years of longing these two have experienced for each other - and also the tragedy between them. A crook and a Fed who can never be together.
N: JACK
C: TA
D: You should probably get that looked at.
N: Karen glances down and sees blood spreading from where her wound has opened up. She ignores the question --
C: ALKAREN
D: Why "The Long Good-Bye?" I mean it's Chandler, but 1973? The others were all classics.
C: JACK
E: shrugs
C: B
D: One good line.
N: Karen looks at him, almost smiles, she knows which one -- RT
C: KAREN
D: 'To say good-bye is to die a little.'
C: JACK
E: so good
C: I mean come on.
D: BE
C: KAREN
D: You think that's true?
C: JACK
D: Not always. Sometimes you die a lot. RO
N: Karen nods, inhales, speaks the hard truth --
C: KAREN
D: You know I'm gonna have to arrest you.
C: JACK
D: Know who we're like? Ralph and Sam.
N: DANIELS & COLEMAN OUT OF SIGHT
C: KAREN
D: Ralph and Sam.
C: JACK
D: That cartoon. The wolf and the sheepdog? They clock in, chase each other all day, and then end of day
C: R
D: they punch out, walk home together. 'Evening Ralph.' 'Evening, Sam.'
E: he looks at her
C: ZA
D: Who's to say this time we don't just walk home together?
N: Karen considers, changes the subject, priorities -- KAREN
C: TA
D: You really have her somewhere safe?
C: JACK
D: Yeah. And I think she wants to testify, she's just scared.
C: AL KAREN
D: She should be. The guy who came after her doesn't fit the motive of the bangers who killed her friends. There's something bigger going on.
C: JACK B
D: And if somebody in your own office gave Lola up--
C: KAREN
D: RT
N: --Why are you doing this, Jack?
C: JACK
D: I already told you that.
C: KAREN
D: BE
N: Love. Right.
C: JACK
D: From where I'm sitting? You've got a pretty short list of people you can trust. And believe me, I'd be sitting RO
N: anywhere but here if I wasn't one of them. Karen looks at him again, still weighing his honesty --
C: KAREN
D: I need a number for you. When I call it, you pick up or I get a call back within five minutes. Day or night.
N: DANIELS & COLEMAN OUT OF SIGHT
C: JACK
D: I can do that.
C: KAREN
D: Good. Because if you don't I will immediately initiate a manhunt.
C: R JACK
D: Understood.
C: ZA KAREN
D: If you see any perceived threat to Lola's safety, if her location is compromised, you do not handle it yourself. I am your call.
C: TA JACK
D: What about kissing?
C: KAREN
D: Try it again and so help me I will shoot you a second time.
C: AL JACK
D: I'll take that as a maybe.
C: KAREN
D: It's not a maybe.
C: B
D: Jack opens the door.
C: KAREN
D: Jack. It's not a maybe. RT
E: CONT'D
C: JACK
D: Evening, Ralph.
N: Jack steps out of the car. Under her breath -- BE
C: KAREN
D: Maybe I'll just shoot you now...
N: Jack turns back, having overheard --
C: JACK
D: RO
N: You won't.
C: KAREN
D: Why not?
C: JACK
D: Because you're having too much fun.
N: DANIELS & COLEMAN OUT OF SIGHT
S: EXT./INT. KAREN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

D: Karen turns to exit and help and... she's PUNCHED through the open window -- SMASHING US TO BLACK.
C: ZA
D: INT. KAREN'S CAR - TRUNK - MOMENTS LATER
N: FROM BLACK -- the sound of a car starting. A RED BRAKE light casts an eery glow that REVEALS Karen, waking up in the trunk of her own car, dazed. Jack is out cold, next to her.
C: TA KAREN
D: Jack. Jack, wake up.
N: Jack's eyes open. He works his aching jaw. His tongue tastes blood. Ouch. The car lurches forward. Karen tries to kick the drunk door. BAM. BAM. No good. Jack, still dazed, says --
C: AL JACK
D: I remember this being more romantic.
C: KAREN
D: I remember wanting you dead.
C: B JACK
D: Here's to making new memories. RT
E: smiles, ouch
