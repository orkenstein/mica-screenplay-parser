M: COLD OPEN
S: INT. RAFA’S BEDROOM - MID-MORNING - SATURDAY
N: RAFA (16, sweet, nervous, well-intentioned) is in his small, messy room, laying in bed, scrolling through Instagram. There’s a blanket hung up in front of the window to keep the light out. It’s quiet and peaceful. Rafa gets a text from MIGUEL, one of his friends (words appear on screen).
C: MIGUEL
D: Yo is ur mom cooking?
E: via text
N: Rafa squints his eyes, tries to sense if his mom is making breakfast. He catches a food smell in the air. He texts back.
C: RAFA
D: Yeah
E: via text
C: MIGUEL
D: I’ma come over What happened w/Mya? Did u ask her out?
E: via text then
C: RAFA
D: No. I got too nervous.
E: via text
C: MIGUEL
D: When u ask her out r u gonna do what ur Uncle Rick said to do lol
N: OFF Rafa’s face--
S: EXT. RAFA’S FRONT PORCH - A WEEK AGO - FLASHBACK
N: Rafa and UNCLE RICK (35, bald, tattooed, wild man).
C: UNCLE RICK
D: If you like a girl, you ask her out on a date to the movies at night. Then, when the movie’s over...you leave without telling her.
C: RAFA
D: ...What?
C: UNCLE RICK
D: Abandon her there. You have to find out early on if she’s resourceful. You want a resourceful woman.
E: MORE CONTINUED
N: Primo “Pilot” 2. Network Draft 1/15/18
C: CONTINUED: UNCLE RICK
D: One who can take care of herself. Can you get me another beer? I don’t wanna go all the way to the kitchen.
E: CONT'D beat
N: Off Rafa -- BACK TO PRESENT Rafa texts back --
C: RAFA
D: Probably not.
E: via text
C: ANGELA
D: Rafa! Time to get moving!
E: O.S.
N: He walks to his bedroom door, then takes a deep breath, like he’s about to dive off a 10-meter platform. He opens it --
S: INT. RAFA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: -- and it’s like he’s been dropped into Times Square. Everything goes from quiet and peaceful and dark to kinetic and chaotic and loud. (Shot as a single unbroken take.) ANGELA (34, whip-smart, always a step ahead of you) buzzes past him, doing laundry.
C: ANGELA
D: Hurry up and get some food before your uncles eat it all.
C: RAFA
D: Okay mom. Just gotta go to the--
N: Rafa opens the bathroom door, but Uncle Rick jumps past him --
C: RAFA
D: Uncle Rick, c’mon!
E: CONT’D frustrated
C: UNCLE RICK
D: Too slow.
E: O.S. through the door
C: RAFA
D: What are you talking about “too slow?” I was here first.
C: UNCLE RICK
D: Too fast then.
E: O.S.
N: (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 3. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED:
C: RAFA
D: Too fast? That’s not even a thing. How long are you gonna be in there?
C: UNCLE RICK
D: Hard to say. We’re all just slaves to our buttholes.
E: O.S.
N: Rafa, grossed out, walks away.
C: UNCLE RICK
D: How did it go with that girl? Did you do what I said? Did she make it home okay?
E: O.S. CONT’D
S: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Rafa walks into the kitchen. UNCLE MATT (31, short, muscular, ex-military) and UNCLE MANUEL (36, artistic, slight hippie vibe) are wolfing down breakfast and loudly arguing --
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: Are you nuts? It’s an American classic!
C: UNCLE MATT
D: I’m sorry, Toy Story 3 was awful. Lots-O’- Huggin’ Bear’s counterinsurgency measures were remedial, at best.
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: “Counterinsurgency measures”? It’s a movie about talking toys. Everything’s not the military, Matt. Rafa, settle an argument. Your Uncle Matt thinks Toy Story 3 was bad because of the...lackluster warfare, I guess. I say it was great. Who’s right?
E: sees Rafa
N: Angela comes buzzing back through --
C: RAFA
D: Ma, Uncle Matt and Uncle Manuel ate all the breakfast.
C: ANGELA
D: There’s more coming. I have to go meet with someone before work.
C: RAFA
D: Who? About what?
N: She gives him a look: “do not ask me questions like that.” (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 4. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED:
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: So Primo -- who’s right? About the movie?
C: RAFA
D: It came out like 10 years ago. How are y’all just now seeing it?
C: UNCLE MATT
D: Hey, what ended up happening with that girl? Did you take my advice?
E: to Rafa
N: Off Rafa’s face --
S: EXT. PARK - THREE DAYS AGO - FLASHBACK
N: Rafa, Uncle Matt, and Uncle Manuel sit at a table. The other uncles and Angela are in the b.g. barbecuing and talking.
C: UNCLE MATT
D: Primo: if you wanna impress a girl, you have to show her how strong you are.
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: Or how tall you are. But Matt can’t do that, so he goes for “strong.”
C: UNCLE MATT
D: Every first date I go on, I figure out a way to do push-ups in front of the girl.
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: That’s why he never has a second date. That and the fact that he’s 3 feet tall.
N: Matt attacks him and they start WRESTLING-- BACK TO SCENE Rafa walks into the front room. UNCLE BRIAN (29, low-grade corporate) walks in, wearing a SUIT.
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: Oh hey Rafa. You’re probably wondering, and yeah, it is a new suit. My job kind of requires that I look nice, so...
C: RAFA
D: ...Do you think I said something?
E: confused
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: Is Rick still in the restroom? I’ll go use the other one.
E: MORE CONTINUED
N: Primo “Pilot” 5. Network Draft 1/15/18
C: CONTINUED: UNCLE BRIAN
D: Oh yeah -- y’all only have one bathroom. I always forget that. My house has two bathrooms. That’s probably why.
E: CONT'D ”remembering”
N: Rafa sighs -- he’s heard this “brag” before. The front door opens. It’s UNCLE JESSE (35, small business owner, self- reliant), yelling to everyone and no one before he’s even in the house, because Uncle Jesse is a goddamn tornado--
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: Terry’s sick! We’re short a man, and I got four irrigation systems to install. Which one of y’all is coming to work with me today?
N: Angela walks toward the table and sets a plate of food down.
C: ANGELA
D: Stop being so loud, Jesse. Rafa! Breakfast! I’m going to work.
E: calling off
N: She leaves. Uncle Jesse picks up the plate and starts eating.
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: Primo! How’d it go with the girl?!
E: sees Rafa
N: Uncle Rick enters --
C: RICK
D: Oh good, more food!
N: He starts eating. Rafa’s phone buzzes -- it’s Miguel again.
C: MIGUEL
D: Wait. Who’s over there? How many uncles?
E: via text
N: Rafa watched Brian, Jesse, Rick, Matt and Manuel all bicker and laugh and fight and squabble.
C: RAFA
D: All of them
E: via text
C: MIGUEL
D: Oh. Nvm then

N: END COLD OPEN Primo “Pilot” 6. Network Draft 1/15/18 ACT ONE
S: INT. HIGH SCHOOL GUIDANCE COUNSELOR’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
N: Rafa sits across from BETSY, his guidance counselor, and forces an uneasy smile (not sure whether he’s in trouble).
C: RAFA
D: Before you start, can I just say that whatever you think I did, I didn’t do it, or if I did, I didn’t mean to, or if I did mean to, I didn’t know it was wrong --
C: BETSY
D: Mr. Gonzales, where do you think you might want to go to college?
E: interrupting
N: Rafa is caught off-guard.
C: RAFA
D: ...I’m sorry?
C: BETSY
D: College. Surely you’ve thought about it. I know I have.
C: RAFA
D: You haven’t gone to college yet?
E: confused
C: BETSY
D: ...I meant for you.
N: She hands him a FORM.
C: BETSY
D: There’s a college prep program here that I’d like you to join. It helps our junior- year students prepare for the college application process. It’s an hour after school, once a week. Just sign that form, and you’re in.
E: CONT'D
C: RAFA
D: I don’t think that’s for me. I’m probably not... right for college.
C: BETSY
D: What does that mean? “Not right.”
C: RAFA
D: Come on. We both know that I... come on.
E: smiles CONTINUED
N: Primo “Pilot” 7. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED: She looks at him for a beat, then hands him a manila folder. Inside are test results.
C: BETSY
D: Do you know what that is?
C: RAFA
D: ...No, but it’s definitely good news. There’s a lot of green here.
C: BETSY
D: Does that matter?
E: curious
C: RAFA
D: Yes. If you get a thing from a teacher in school and it has a lot of green on it, then that’s usually good for you. Red is usually bad. So whatever this is, I probably did good on it.
N: She smiles. Camera slowly PUSHES IN on Rafa as she talks.
C: BETSY
D: Those are the results from the standardized test you and your classmates took at the end of your sophomore year. You scored in the 93rd percentile. That means you scored higher than 92 percent of all the other sophomores in the state of Texas. You’re telling me you’re not right for college, Mr. Gonzales. I’m telling you you’re exactly right for college. And that paper you’re holding proves it.
E: leans in
N: Rafa looks excited, maybe a little scared...
S: EXT. STREET - LATER
N: Rafa walks along with his friends (MIGUEL, MYA, and HARRIS). They’re all 16. Mya is African-American, and more self- assured than Rafa. Harris is looking at Rafa’s test results.
C: HARRIS
D: Yo! You’re a genius!
C: RAFA
D: No I’m not. I just did well on one test. Now the guidance counselor wants me to take this college prep program class. Did y’all know about that?
N: (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 8. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED:
C: MIGUEL
D: I honestly didn’t even know we had a guidance counselor, so no, I don’t think I’ll be joining the college prep program.
C: MYA
D: She told me about it. All the new students had to meet with her, and she brought it up. She kept calling me “Ms. Jones.” Made me feel like a grandma.
C: HARRIS
D: College could be cool.
C: MIGUEL
D: Yeah, maybe. I’ve always wanted to remodel an old house. That might be fun. In the movies, if there’s a college part in it or whatever, there’s always a scene where the friends get together and fix up some old house. They’re all painting real fast, somebody squirts someone else with a hose, another person falls off a small ladder into a bush. Seems fun.
E: off their confusion
C: RAFA
D: You...you know that’s not what college is, right? That’s just painting. You don’t have to go to college to paint a house.
C: HARRIS
D: No way I’m going to college. College is for white people, and maybe rich Asians.
C: MIGUEL
D: No Mexican has ever gone to college. Ever.
E: nods
C: RAFA
D: There’s no way that’s true.
C: MIGUEL
D: Selena didn’t go to college. She didn’t go, so I’m not going.
C: MYA
D: Man, Selena never got to restore an old house? I feel bad for her.
N: Rafa laughs, she smiles at him. They pass the store where Angela works. (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 9. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED: (2)
C: RAFA
D: Y’all give me a minute. I’ma say what’s up to my mom.
S: INT. CORNER STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: It’s not busy. Rafa sees Angela talking to a MAN. She’s holding a medium-sized box and shaking his hand. She notices Rafa, then says goodbye to the guy, who then leaves.
C: RAFA
D: Who was that? Do I know him?
C: ANGELA
D: He works at the grocery store.
C: RAFA
D: What’d he give you? That box?
C: ANGELA
D: Did he give it to you or to me?
E: sharply
N: Rafa knows that tone. He stops his line of questioning.
C: ANGELA
D: How was school?
E: CONT’D
C: RAFA
D: It was school. Just regular.
N: Her eyes flash a little, knowingly. She sees Mya in the b.g.
C: ANGELA
D: Is that our new neighbor? Mya? The one you like?--
C: RAFA
D: OK bye I’m going to Harris’s house.
E: quickly
C: ANGELA
D: I need you home tonight by seven.
C: RAFA
D: Why?
N: She gives him a look. Same as the tone, Rafa recognizes it.
C: RAFA
D: Your looks are getting scarier every day.
E: CONT’D
N: (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 10. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED:
C: ANGELA
D: You’re getting older every day -- takes more to scare you. Be home by 7.
N: Rafa leaves the store. Angela opens the box the guy gave her (we can’t see what’s inside) and smiles.
C: ANGELA
D: Bang.
E: CONT’D to herself
S: INT. RAFA’S HOUSE - 6:30 P.M.
N: Angela and the uncles are putting the finishing touches on a surprise party for Rafa. There about 15 PEOPLE in attendance, including Angela and the five uncles. Brian and Jesse are hanging a BANNER we can’t read yet. Matt is sitting at the table. Angela sets an all-white cake down on the table.
C: ANGELA
D: Matt? This is your job.
N: She hands him a plastic baggie filled with blue icing, tears a small piece of the corner off the bag, then squeezes it so some of the icing comes out.
C: UNCLE MATT
D: What am I supposed to do with this?
C: ANGELA
D: Use it to write on the cake. Write: “Congratulations, Rafa!” on there.
C: UNCLE RICK
D: If you can’t see, I’ll get you a phone book to sit on.
N: Matt swipes at Rick.
C: ANGELA
D: And I need to talk to y’all about something. Listen up, dumb-dumbs!
E: to the room
N: All of the uncles stop what they’re doing and look at her.
C: ANGELA
D: Rafa’s guidance counselor called me a few weeks ago. She said he scored really well on some test, and she thinks he has a good chance at going to college when he graduates. He hasn’t said anything about it, but I know she met with him today.
E: CONT’D
N: (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 11. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED:
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: How do you know that?
C: ANGELA
D: Because I’m smarter than all of you.
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: It’s a mistake!
N: They all look at him.
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: He should be working. He’s 16 now! He’ll be 17 by the end of the school year, and soon he’ll be 18!
E: CONT’D
C: RICK
D: Jesse’s right. That is how numbers work.
N: Manuel and Rick laugh. Jesse grits his teeth.
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: I’m glad he’s gonna graduate high school. That’s great. But if Rafa starts working for me now, he’ll be ready to run his own crew by the time he graduates.
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: You’re an idiot.
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: No, I’m a guy with a plan.
C: ANGELA
D: This is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. I don’t want y’all in his ear about this like y’all are with everything else. Nobody say a word to him about it.
N: Uncle Jesse begins to say something. Angela cuts him off.
C: ANGELA
D: Not a word. Leave him be.
E: CONT’D
N: She heads off. Jesse looks angry. Rick twists the knife.
C: UNCLE RICK
D: Hey yo Jesse -- after Rafa is 18, what age does he turn next? Do you know?
S: EXT. RAFA’S STREET - EARLY EVENING
N: Rafa and Mya walk. (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 12. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED:
C: MYA
D: So you gonna do that class? Become a college boy?
C: RAFA
D: Part of me wants to. Nobody in my family has ever been to college before. It’d be neat to be the first one. And my mom would freak. She’d be so happy. But if I even bring it up, all my uncles are gonna be all over me about what I should do.
E: then; realizing
C: MYA
D: “All” your uncles? How many do you have?
C: RAFA
D: Five. Feels like 50 sometimes, though. My dad left when I was little, so the uncles are super protective of my mom and me. It’s weird. I have no dad but also five dads.
C: MYA
D: Ha. What’s that like?
N: Rafa thinks.
C: RAFA
D: Have you seen that movie Inside Out? Where the different emotions are all inside the girl’s head controlling her? It’s like that. Except but there’s cussing.
C: MYA
D: That sounds kinda fun.
C: RAFA
D: It’s very not. They’re everywhere! Always at my house, every morning and night...I even work part-time with my Uncle Jesse at his construction jobs, and all the other uncles are there sometimes.
C: MYA
D: You work construction? How’s that go?
E: chuckles
N: Off Rafa’s embarrassed grin. Primo “Pilot” 13. Network Draft 1/15/18
S: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - FLASHBACK
N: We see Rafa struggling to dig a trench. He’s sweaty and exhausted. Uncle Jesse walks by in the b.g.
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: How’s it going bud?
C: RAFA
D: Pretty good. Except my arms are on fire, and everything hurts, and I’m dying. How long have I been doing this?
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: Eight minutes.
E: checks watch
N: END FLASHBACK Rafa and Mya are still walking.
C: MYA
D: At least you get paid, right?
C: RAFA
D: Yeah, that part is nice. This one’s my house.
E: re: house
C: MYA
D: Cool. Thanks for walking with me. I still don’t know the neighborhood that well.
C: RAFA
D: Yeah, no problem. You’re only a couple houses away, so we can walk together. Anytime. If you want to go anywhere. For any reason. Or whatever.
N: She looks at him, confused. He blushes and averts his eyes.
C: RAFA
D: Anyway, later. I’ma go hide from my uncles --
E: CONT’D quickly
N: Rafa opens the front door.
C: EVERYONE
D: SURPRISE!
N: Music starts to play. Everyone is clapping and yelling. Rafa and Mya are both, indeed, surprised. (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 14. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED:
C: MYA
D: ...I think they found you.
S: INT. RAFA’S HOUSE - LATER
N: Music playing, party in full swing. Rafa and Mya. She looks around, sees the BANNER.
C: MYA
D: Does that sign say, “You’re a Junior!”?
C: RAFA
D: Yes. It’s just what my mom does. Every time I do a thing that she’s proud of, she throws a party.
E: slightly embarrassed
S: INT. RAFA’S HOUSE - FLASHBACKS
N: We see a series of similar BANNERS and PARTIES: --“Congrats on Your Lifeguard License!” --“You Finished Watching All The Episodes of Mad Men!” --“Happy Subway Sandwich Punch Card Completion!” BACK TO SCENE Mya and Rafa.
C: MYA
D: What’s Mad Men?
C: RAFA
D: It’s a show that if you pretend to like it, people think you’re sophisticated. Uncle Brian made me watch it when he got a Netflix account.
N: Angela comes over and hugs Rafa.
C: ANGELA
D: Gather around everyone! I just wanna say how proud we all are of our Primo. I can’t believe you’re already a junior.
N: Angela hands him a BOX.
C: RAFA
D: What’s this?
C: ANGELA
D: It’s a present.
E: CONTINUED
N: Primo “Pilot” 15. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED:
C: RAFA
D: I mean, I know. I was asking what’s inside.
C: ANGELA
D: Why do you not know how presents work?
N: Rafa opens the box to find a nice SPORTCOAT.
C: ANGELA
D: It’s for you to wear at the party! And whatever other events you might attend this year...or beyond.
E: CONT’D
N: Rafa smiles. It feels like everyone is pumping good vibes into him. Overcome with happiness, now he can’t help himself.
C: RAFA
D: I actually have an announcement to make. I met with my guidance counselor today...And I’m going to college!
N: His mom is overjoyed. The room is overjoyed. He’s glowing, and Angela is glowing, and everyone is cheering, and it’s a great moment. Until it’s not.
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: Over my dead body!
E: with great authority
N: Everyone shuts up. Rafa looks scared. Angela looks furious. Mya looks thrilled.
C: MYA
D: This party is great!
E: to Rafa
N: END OF ACT ONE Primo “Pilot” 16. Network Draft 1/15/18 ACT TWO
S: INT. - LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
N: Uncle Jesse and Uncle Brian have pulled Rafa aside. Angela is out of sight. Uncle Rick is in the b.g. drinking a beer. Other people are around, but they’re mostly all keeping to themselves. There’s an awkwardness in the air.
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: Listen, I know you’re very excited right now. But college... it’s not the way to go. You should be working, contributing to the family, helping your mom.
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: It absolutely is the way to go. Education is crucial. Look at me -- I went to trade school for two years, got a degree, and now I make the most money of anyone in the family.
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: You made $800 more than me last year.
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: My house has two bathrooms, Rafa. Two.
E: ”trump card”
N: Angela materializes out of thin air --
C: ANGELA
D: Enough. Both of you.
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: Where did you come from?!
E: surprised
C: ANGELA
D: Rafa, get out of here. And you two, I already told you: leave him alone. I need to check on the cake.
E: heading off
C: RAFA
D: Cake? What cake? Ma, this is important...
N: Uncle Brian and Uncle Jesse continue arguing. Rafa, sensing an opportunity to escape, slips away...
S: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Uncle Matt is writing with the icing. Uncle Manuel, who is wandering past, looks at the cake. (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 17. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED:
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: You spelled it wrong, dummy. There’s supposed to be an apostrophe in “congratulations.”
C: UNCLE MATT
D: No, there’s not.
E: looking at the cake
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: Yes, there is, before the “S.” Like this.
N: Uncle Manuel picks up the icing bag and adds the apostrophe. They both look at it.
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: See?
E: CONT’D
C: UNCLE MATT
D: Nope. That’s definitely wrong.
N: Uncle Matt scrapes the apostrophe off, which makes the cake a tiny bit messy.
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: It needs the apostrophe! Brian -- who’s right, me or Matt?
E: louder
N: Uncle Brian walks over, looks at the cake...
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: You know, I saw this documentary on Netflix about wealthy families and the parties they throw. They have these gigantic, very ornate, very expensive cakes. I’m talking thousands of dollars for a cake. Thousands.
N: A beat. Uncle Manuel looks at him.
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: ...So is there an apostrophe or not?
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: No idea. It was a good documentary, though. You should watch it.
S: INT. RAFA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: He closes the door, sits down on the edge of his bed. After a second, he reaches into his pocket and takes out the form the counselor gave him -- there’s a URL a the top that says “for more information...” (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 18. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED: He walks to the computer in his room, toggles the mouse and the screen comes on -- it’s a bank account screen. He sees the username (AngelaGon***) and realizes his mom must’ve used the computer last and forgot to close the browser window. He sees that her password is autosaved, so he clicks the login button...and sees that she has exactly $52 in her account. He looks down the jacket that she gave to him as a gift, and then out at the party...
C: RAFA
D: Damn.
E: to himself, solemnly
S: INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
N: Uncle Matt and Uncle Manuel are arguing again about the apostrophe. Uncle Rick is nearby.
C: UNCLE MATT
D: Just tell me, is this right?
E: re: cake
C: UNCLE RICK
D: It’s ugly. So if you meant for it to be ugly, then yes, it’s right. Good job.
N: Uncle Manuel yet again adds an apostrophe on there.
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: Now it’s right.
C: UNCLE MATT
D: No, damnit. That’s not what an apostrophe is for.
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: Then what’s an apostrophe for?
C: UNCLE MATT
D: ...Not that!
E: no idea
C: UNCLE RICK
D: An apostrophe shows ownership. Or it combines words.
E: sips his beer
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: Rick’s right. And it’s Rafa’s cake, so he owns it, so it needs an apostrophe. Incidentally, “Rick’s right” also has an apostrophe in it.
N: (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 19. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED:
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: ...Maybe the apostrophe goes after the S?
E: CONT’D
C: UNCLE RICK
D: Maybe try it before the S and also after the S, too.
E: sarcastically
C: UNCLE MATT
D: You know what? That’s a good idea. Why don’t we just put apostrophes every- goddamn-where!
N: He starts icing everywhere. Angela storms in --
C: ANGELA
D: What is going on in here?! Did you finish the cake?
C: UNCLE MATT
D: ...Kind of?
N: She takes a look: ANGLE ON the cake: SC’ONGR’A’TULAT’ION’S’ RAFA! A complete mess. She’s madder.
C: ANGELA
D: Literally all you had to do was write two words on a cake!
C: UNCLE MATT
D: It’s Manuel’s fault!
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: Shut up!
N: Uncle Matt shoves Uncle Manuel backward. He crashes into the table and KNOCKS THE CAKE on the floor. They all look ashamed. Angela fumes.
C: ANGELA
D: I will not let you dolts ruin this. Get me a knife.
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING
N: Angela enters carrying a TINY CAKE -- she’s cut out the middle chunk that wasn’t ruined: just a tiny fist-sized cake with “Rafa!” written on it. Doing her best to keep a positive energy: (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 20. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED:
C: ANGELA
D: Cake time, everyone!
N: Mya and Rafa are on the other side of the room.
C: MYA
D: Why is that cake the tiniest cake in the world? Are you the only one who gets to eat cake? Mexicans have weird traditions.
E: to Rafa
N: Rafa walks over to his mom, serving the cake as best she can.
C: ANGELA
D: There you go, Rick.
N: Rick looks down at the thimble-sized piece of cake.
C: RICK
D: I guess I’ll eat half now and save the rest for later.
N: He walks off.
C: RAFA
D: Ma, don’t get mad, but I was getting on the computer and your bank account page was up, and I saw that you only have--
C: ANGELA
D: Don’t worry about it, Primo. I have it under control.
E: cutting him off
C: RAFA
D: What do you mean “don’t worry about it?” It’s the 9th of the month and you only have $52 in your account. And I’m wearing this coat you got me that cost who knows how much, but definitely more than $52, and there’s this party going on --
C: ANGELA
D: You have small eyes, Rafa. You can’t see the whole picture yet.
E: cutting him off again
C: RAFA
D: Ma, I’m tryna talk to you about real, actual issues. Why are you talking like The Oracle from The Matrix? College costs money that you don’t have. That we don’t have.
N: (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 21. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED: (2)
C: ANGELA
D: You sound like your Uncle Jesse. Did Uncle Jesse just put ideas in your head? This party wasn’t an impromptu purchase. Neither was that jacket. I’ve been working toward it for weeks.
E: off his look
S: INT. GROCERY STORE - A MONTH AGO - FLASHBACK
N: Angela and a MAN chat at the grocery store...
C: ANGELA
D: A guy at the grocery store was talking about how he had this rash on his foot.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CORNER STORE - FLASHBACK CONTD
N: Angela makes a deal with a NURSE.
C: ANGELA
D: So, you know the nurse’s aide who comes into the corner store? She traded me some samples of the rash medicine, for some bus passes, because I know she rides the bus, because it stops near the store and I see her getting on it each morning.
C: RAFA
D: How’d you get the bus passes?
E: V.O.
S: EXT. BUS STATION - FLASHBACK CONTD
N: Angela gives the BUS DRIVER a BIG PLATE OF FOOD. He smiles.
C: ANGELA
D: I always hear the bus driver complaining about eating a cold lunch because his break isn’t long enough to get off the bus and pick food up somewhere. So I made him a hot plate every day for a week, and he slipped me a handful of bus passes.
E: V.O.
N: END FLASHBACK
C: ANGELA
D: So: hot food to bus driver, bus tokens to nurse, foot medicine to guy in the grocery store -- and he has a booth at the flea market where he sells clothes, so he gave me a coat for you.
N: (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 22. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED:
C: RAFA
D: You bought this coat with food medicine? I’m wearing a foot medicine coat?
C: ANGELA
D: Who cares how I got it? It’s new and it’s yours.
C: RAFA
D: What about all the food at this party?
C: ANGELA
D: Easy!
S: EXT. STREET - A MONTH AGO - FLASHBACK
N: Angela walks along and sees a WOMAN in a BROKEN-DOWN CAR --
C: ANGELA
D: A month ago, I saw a woman up the street whose car wouldn’t start. She needed to find an alternator --
E: V.O.
C: RAFA
D: Stop stop stop.
E: V.O.
N: END FLASHBACK
C: RAFA
D: I can’t take it. It’s too much, Ma. Our whole life is a Jenga tower!
N: Angela takes Rafa’s face in her hands.
C: ANGELA
D: Don’t worry about any of that, Rafa. That’s my job. Your job is to just wear your new foot coat. Big eyes.
E: smiles
N: She kisses him on the forehead and walks away. Rafa watches her walk into the living room, moving from person to person, working the room. He looks around the house, then makes a decision -- He reaches into his pocket, takes out the form the counselor gave him, looks at it one last time, then crumples it up and throws it in the trash.

S: EXT. STREET - 3:30 P.M. WEDNESDAY
N: Rafa walks with Miguel, Mya, and Harris again after school.
C: MIGUEL
D: How was your party last night?
C: RAFA
D: ...Fine I guess.
C: MIGUEL
D: Your ma invited me. I was gonna come, but then I didn’t because I didn’t want to.
C: MYA
D: I went. It was crazy. My favorite part was the tiny cake. My least favorite part was every other thing.
N: Rafa purses his lips.
C: MYA
D: Hey, why does your family call you “Primo?” I kept hearing that. Doesn’t that mean “cousin?”
E: CONT’D
C: RAFA
D: Yeah. It started when I was a baby. ‘Cause of how my uncles are kind of my dad? -- they gave me the nickname. It kind of makes sense. Everything in our family kind of makes sense.
N: She chuckles.
C: HARRIS
D: Did you figure out if you’re gonna go to college or are you gonna work?
C: RAFA
D: Probably work. My mom doesn’t have a lot of money. I wanna help. What?
E: off Mya’s look
C: MYA
D: I just figured you’d pick college. And your mom doesn’t really seem like she needs a lot of help.
N: Rafa thinks about that as they walk... Primo “Pilot” 24. Network Draft 1/15/18
S: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - LATER
N: Rafa walks through the construction site, past Jesse’s truck parked out in front of the site’s temporary trailer.
S: INT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER
N: Rafa walks in. Uncle Jesse is working.
C: RAFA
D: Hey, Uncle Jess. You got a minute?
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: Yeah, but not much more. I got your Uncle Rick, Matt and Manuel working today, so we’re running late, because Matt keeps fussing at them about how the kid from E.T should’ve never been able to outflank the government agents. What’s up?
C: RAFA
D: You’ve been saying I should start coming to work with you more hours. Is that offer still available?
N: Uncle Jesse looks at him. His interest is piqued.
C: RAFA
D: I think it’s time I started helping my m--
E: CONT’D
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: One second.
E: pulls out his cell phone
N: Jesse dials and puts the phone on speaker. After a few rings--
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: This is Brian.
E: V.O. over speaker
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: Hey, stupid. Rafa’s here right now. I want you to hear this conversation him and I are about to have so you can know that I beat you.
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: What are you talking about?
E: V.O. over speaker
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: Go ‘head, Rafa.

E: loudly
N: The door to the trailer flies open: Manuel and Rick.
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: -- the point is, Elliot’s bike was magic, and Matt refuses to acknowledge --
C: UNCLE RICK
D: Yeah, I don’t really care. Primo! What are you doing here?
E: sees Rafa
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: Good, everyone’s here. Now you can all hear what Rafa was about to say, because it makes me the winner.
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: Wait, everyone’s there? Matt, too?
E: V.O. on phone
C: RAFA
D: No, Matt’s not here.
C: UNCLE RICK
D: Well, not that we can see, but it’s Matt, so he could be anywhere. Check to see if maybe he climbed inside a desk drawer and took a nap.
C: RAFA
D: Uncle Jess, I kinda wanted to talk to you, like, one-on-one.
N: Uncle Matt bursts in --
C: UNCLE MATT
D: What’s going on in here?
C: UNCLE RICK
D: There he is! Where were you, little buddy? Hiding in a teacup or something?
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: Glad you’re here, Matt. Rafa said he wants to have an Uncle Meeting.
N: (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 26. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED: (2)
C: RAFA
D: No I didn’t. I don’t want that. I never want that. In fact, I want the opposite of an Uncle Meeting.
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: An... aunt... separation?
C: UNCLE RICK
D: That was pretty good.
C: RAFA
D: I just wanted to come here and talk to Uncle Jesse about working. That’s it. But what’s happening right now -- -- is what happens all the time. You guys just come over the top of everything and it’s all chaos and nobody listens to what I’m saying.
E: frustrated gesturing to everyone
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: What happened to college?! You should do that! Because it’s the best way to build a bright future, and also because then I’ll win!
E: V.O.
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: No, he should work!
C: UNCLE MATT
D: If the concern is money, you should know that the military will pay for your school if you serve for four years. That’s what I did.
C: UNCLE RICK
D: You didn’t go to college.
C: UNCLE MATT
D: I mean, I did the first half of that agreement, is what I’m saying.
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: Rafa should follow his heart. When the winds of change blow, it’s best to open your sail and harvest their energy.
C: UNCLE MATT
D: Hey, Shakespeare. How about you blow those winds of change out of your ass?
N: (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 27. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED: (3)
C: UNCLE RICK
D: If it’s Manuel’s ass, then there’s an apostrophe in it.
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: If I had to guess which one of y’all had an apostrophe in your ass, Manuel would absolutely be my first guess.
C: RAFA
D: What is anybody talking about right now?
E: losing it
N: The door to the trailer opens. It’s Angela, once again seeming to materialize out of thin air.
C: ANGELA
D: What. Are. Y’all. Doing?!
E: in a loud, stern voice
N: All the uncles stop talking. Uncle Jesse sits down and pretends like he’s typing on a computer on the desk.
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: ...Is that Angela?
E: V.O. through phone; nervous
C: ANGELA
D: Yes.
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: Oh [bleep].
E: V.O.
N: He hangs up quickly.
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: Angela? Good news. Rafa has decided he wants to start wor–-
C: ANGELA
D: Close your mouth. Your friends are at Miguel’s, waiting for you. Go. And be home for dinner.
E: to Rafa
N: Rafa sighs and leaves. Angela turns to her brothers and composes herself.
C: ANGELA
D: I took the bus here. Could one of you please give me a ride home? I’ll wait outside.
E: CONT’D quietly
N: (CONTINUED) Primo “Pilot” 28. Network Draft 1/15/18 CONTINUED: (4) She leaves.
C: UNCLE MATT
D: Oof. Her super quiet calm voice.

D: The scariest one. She’s pissed.
E: nodding
N: Jesse follows her out.
S: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - LATER
N: Angela walks to Uncle Jesse’s truck. Jesse and Manuel follow.
C: ANGELA
D: It’s been a long day, so I don’t want to hear anything from any of you about yesterday, or the day before that, or any day before any day or any night before any night. You understand?
C: UNCLE MANUEL UNCLE JESSE
D: Yeah. Fine.
N: Beat.
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: I just don’t understand why you’re mad! Rafa came to me. I didn’t go to him. He came to me and said he wants to work. How is that bad?
E: CONT’D
C: ANGELA
D: He decided that because you pressed him.
C: UNCLE MANUEL
D: Don’t you want Rafa to go to college?! Why aren’t you tell him that? Why aren’t you telling him anything? He doesn’t know what you want. Nobody does.
C: ANGELA
D: What I want is for you all to leave him alone about all of this.
C: UNCLE BRIAN
D: Okay, but...
C: ANGELA
D: There’s no “but.” Y’all need to understand that the influence you have on him is meaningful. This isn’t just you showing him how to ride a bike.
E: MORE CONTINUED
N: Primo “Pilot” 29. Network Draft 1/15/18
C: CONTINUED: ANGELA
D: He’s not a kid anymore. You might push him toward making a decision that he’ll regret for a long time. I hope he goes to college. That’s what I want. But it’s a decision he has to arrive at on his own, or it won’t work.
E: CONT'D before they can object
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: That doesn’t make sense. If you want a thing, speak up! It’s like a restaurant. You don’t just hope for the waiter to bring you what you want. You tell him.
N: Angela smirks at him.
C: ANGELA
D: You’re smart today, huh?
C: UNCLE JESSE
D: Every day, Sis.
E: cocky grin

N: Rafa looks -- there’s nothing there.
C: RAFA
D: ...And then you ate it?

D: I ate the food, yeah. Sorry.

D: Hold up, boy. You forgot something.
E: CONT’D from the other room
C: RAFA
D: What I’d forget, Uncle Rick? My breakfast that you ate?
E: snidely
N: Rick hands him the crumpled up college prep program form.
C: RAFA
D: ...I threw this in the trash like, two days ago. How’d you know I threw it away? Or even what it was?
E: CONT’D confused
C: UNCLE RICK
D: I didn’t. I was looking for chicken wings that people might’ve tossed out. Most people only eat, like, half the meat on a chicken wing. If you gather enough of them, it’s basically a whole extra meal. I call it “trash meat.” Anyways, I found the paper, looked important, so I put it in my pocket.
E: then
C: RAFA
D: ...Have you been wearing the same pants for three days?
C: UNCLE RICK
D: Never mind that. What’s going on? Sit down, Primo. Talk to your Uncle Rick.
N: Rafa sits back down.
C: RAFA
D: It’s just too much. There are too many opinions about what I’m supposed to do. And Uncle Jesse is probably right. It’s better for me to start working right now. I can’t leave. Ma has, like, $50 to her name. Who’s gonna take care of her if--
T: Uncle Rick cuts him off.
C: UNCLE RICK
D: Wait, wait, wait. First of all, you don’t really think you take care of your mom, do you? Because you don’t. She’s been taking care of everyone else since she was, like, 9 years old.
E: MORE CONTINUED

C: RAFA
D: Why is everyone so philosophical all of a sudden?!
C: UNCLE RICK
D: And second: boo hoo. You got six people who give a damn about what happens to you. How terrible that must be.
N: That hits Rafa a little -- he’d never seen it that way.
C: UNCLE RICK
D: Look, I don’t wanna tell you that we’re not gonna keep shoving advice into your face. Because we are. It’s what we do. We’ve done it since you were tiny. We’ll do it until we’re all dead. But ultimately it’s your call. Whatever you decide, we’ll be fine. Your mother’ll be fine. Because besides her own toughness, she also has us. Her brothers. Every single one of us would serve jail time for her. And I already have!
E: CONT’D
C: RAFA
D: You didn’t serve jail time for her. You served jail time because you crashed your motorcycle through the plate glass window of a Whataburger.
C: UNCLE RICK
D: And I’d do it again, if your mom asked me to. Because I’m her brother.
N: Rafa takes a deep breath.
C: RAFA
D: Maybe you’re right. Maybe it’s good for me to have all these voices in my li--
C: UNCLE RICK
D: Yeah yeah yeah okay be quiet, I’m tryna watch TV. Bug off.

D: I’m gonna try to get into college. Some of you think it’s a good idea, some think it’s a bad idea, but it’s my call, and I’ve decided I’m going to try.
N: It’s quiet and still for a second. Then we see a fist get extended out. It’s Uncle Rick’s, who’s not even looking at Rafa because he’s too busy eating his food. Rafa smiles, reaches out and taps Uncle Rick’s fist with his own.
C: RAFA
D: So, what that means is—
E: CONT’D

C: UNCLE MATT
D: How much longer is this gonna go on? I gotta go to the bathroom.
