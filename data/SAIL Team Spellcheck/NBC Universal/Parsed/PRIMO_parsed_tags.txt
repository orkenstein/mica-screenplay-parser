C:                     UNCLE MANUEL
D:           “Counterinsurgency measures”? It’s a

D:           not the military, Matt.
E:               (sees Rafa)
D:           Rafa, settle an argument. Your Uncle Matt
D:           thinks Toy Story 3 was bad because of
D:           the...lackluster warfare, I guess. I say

E:               (off their confusion)
D:           In the movies, if there’s a college part
D:           in it or whatever, there’s always a scene
D:           where the friends get together and fix up

D:           fast, somebody squirts someone else with

E:               (before they can object)
D:           I hope he goes to college. That’s what I
D:           want. But it’s a decision he has to
D:           arrive at on his own, or it won’t work.

D:           That doesn’t make sense. If you want a
D:           thing, speak up! It’s like a restaurant.
D:           You don’t just hope for the waiter to
D:           bring you what you want. You tell him.

0: 
C:                      UNCLE RICK
D:           I didn’t. I was looking for chicken wings
D:           that people might’ve tossed out. Most
D:           people only eat, like, half the meat on a
D:           chicken wing. If you gather enough of
D:           them, it’s basically a whole extra meal.
D:           I call it “trash meat.”
E:               (then)
D:           Anyways, I found the paper, looked

C:                     RAFA
D:           It’s just too much. There are too many
D:           opinions about what I’m supposed to do.
D:           And Uncle Jesse is probably right. It’s
D:           better for me to start working right now.
D:           I can’t leave. Ma has, like, $50 to her

D:           We’ve done it since you were tiny. We’ll
D:           do it until we’re all dead. But
D:           ultimately it’s your call. Whatever you
D:           decide, we’ll be fine. Your mother’ll be
D:           fine. Because besides her own toughness,
D:           she also has us. Her brothers. Every
D:           single one of us would serve jail time
D:           for her. And I already have!
0: 
C:                     RAFA
D:           You didn’t serve jail time for her. You
D:           served jail time because you crashed your

D:           of a Whataburger.

D:           I’ve decided I’m going to try.
