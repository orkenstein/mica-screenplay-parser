S: INT. NONDESCRIPT DARK SPACE - NIGHT
N: Two TEENAGE GIRLS (LIBBY and ASTRID) are covered head to toe in a red, gooey, glowing disgusting gelatinous material. So covered that they’d be pretty unrecognizable in a lineup. One of them reaches purposefully into the open chest cavity of a GIANT MONSTER BEING. She is neck deep in monster guts, rooting around. WET, SLOPPY SQUISHING SOUNDS ensue. She picks up a banana-shaped organ and holds it up for her friend, trying not to inhale or look too closely.
C: LIBBY
D: Gross! Is this it? It has those fuzzy swirly thingies.
N: Astrid looks at the organ and compares it against a chart.
C: ASTRID
D: Fascinating extracellular matrix. But I don’t think so. It’s supposed to be more dick-shaped.
N: Beat.
C: ASTRID
D: Ohhhh, you know what? I think ”Tonton” basically means tongue. So. Yeah, just rip out his tongue.
E: CONT'D beat
C: LIBBY
D: Just?
C: ASTRID
D: Here, I’ll do it.
N: Astrid shoves her hands into the monster’s gullet as Libby peels her hands out of the gooey abdomen.
C: ASTRID
D: Got it!
E: CONT'D
N: They drop the tongue into a GLOWING COLLECTION DEVICE.
C: ASTRID
D: Look on the bright side, only 13 more of these and we can close the portal...
E: CONT'D
C: LIBBY
D: Great. Just in time for Formal.
N: The monster’s GIGANTIC eyes flip open, and the girls SCREAM! TITLE CARD: “Three Days Ago...”
S: EXT. COPPERS COVE - GOLDEN HOUR
N: The sun is setting on Coppers Cove, Ohio, a peculiar, complicated place full of secrets. It has all the ingredients of an idyllic and safe small town, but there’s something sinister brewing underneath.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN SKY - NIGHT
N: A very full, very pink moon... THEN - SCRIBBLED ACROSS THE SCREEN: S U ND AY
S: INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: A clean quiet car... No sounds of squishing. Only the sexy dulcet tones of Wicked Game by Chris Isaac drift into the air from the dashboard iPhone, as... LIBBY, 16, romantic, emotional and fat with a “pretty face,” drives the car while wearing homemade night vision goggles.
C: LIBBY
D: This song makes me want to write poetry in a field of daffodils.
N: ASTRID, 16, feisty and fat with a “pretty intense sex drive,” rides shotgun, also wearing homemade night vision goggles.
C: ASTRID
D: This song makes me want to dry hump in the back of a pickup truck at Burger King.
N: They look at each other, goggle-eyed, and crack up laughing.
T: SMASH CUT TITLE: PUDGE PATROL
S: INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Ace of Base plays on the radio. It might be 2020, but these girls have tastes that skew way 90s. They pass PROMISE ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL, which Astrid FLIPS OFF. Astrid grabs a thick spiral notebook labeled “Operation: What Cool Kids Do At N ight. ”
C: ASTRID
D: So, to conclude the research from last night, dance clubs are over but video arcades are happening.
E: scanning through
N: They pass OUR LADY OF THE LAKE CHURCH, and both SHUDDER.
C: LIBBY
D: Confirmed.
N: Libby turns on a cookie-cutter street lined with upper middle class suburban homes and parks. Patrol time.
C: ASTRID
D: Great. New Pudge Patrol mission, commencing now.
N: They strap on their binocular masks. Libby stares into a house on the left side of the street. Astrid peers intensely into a goth bedroom on the right side of the street.
C: ASTRID
D: Jackpot.
E: CONT'D
C: LIBBY
D: You got him?
C: ASTRID
D: Okay well I can’t see him, but I’m pretty sure I see an upside down
C: cross. SO hot.
D: Affirmative. It’s definitely his room. I spy a Billie Eilish poster. Assuming that’s a band? Maybe we should give him a listen?
E: beat
C: LIBBY
D: Adding to the list.
C: ASTRID
D: Ohmygod ohmygod, the subject is in frame! Hello, Sparrow.
N: SPARROW, 17, a studly brooding goth teen steps into frame.
C: ASTRID
D: God he looks good. Yeah that’s right, baby, you stretch that sexy bod. Yeah. You rub on that stomach. Just a real slow, gentle rub. You gonna take those itchy pants off for mama?
E: CONT'D beat beat beat
C: LIBBY
D: Jesus Christ.
C: ASTRID
D: Oh please, like you wouldn’t hit it.
C: LIBBY
D: You know I’m saving myself for my soulmate. Can we focus on the cultural task at hand please? See any, like, movie posters? Books?
E: beat
C: ASTRID
D: It’s really hard to see but I think I see an iguana cage? How about bitchface Candace? Anything good? Because I can’t imagine anything better than this sexy brooding bastard.
E: beat
N: Through Libby’s binoculars we see Candace’s yard.
C: LIBBY
D: Not sure. Something weird is afoot at the Queen C-Bomb’s. Her back gate is open and it never is. Libby scans over to CANDACE in her bedroom, head mean girl, beautiful, sexy and effortlessly cool.
C: LIBBY
D: God I bet she can eat whateh- what was that?!
E: CONT'D
N: Astrid quickly turns her binoculars to Candace’s house.
C: ASTRID
D: What am I looking at?
C: LIBBY
D: It looked like someone was sneaking around in the backyard.
N: A DARK FIGURE emerges from Candace’s back gate and creeps down the street toward a nondescript grey SUV and disappears into the night. The girls tear their binocular masks off and look at each other, eyes wide.
C: ASTRID
D: That ain’t Tate’s car.
N: Astrid jumps out to get a closer look, spots something on the ground, picks it up. Runs back to car. Astrid holds up a POLAROID. It’s an artsy, topless photo of Candace, hands over her boobs.
C: LIBBY
D: Whoa.
C: ASTRID
D: Uh, this is hella weird.
C: LIBBY
D: Correct.
C: ASTRID
D: You drive, I’ll record.
N: They look at each other excitedly as they drive off. This MUST be documented. This is their favorite part. Both girls start thinking out loud, not speaking TO each other, just more AT each other. Very stream of consciousness, but this is how they do it. Astrid scribbles every word.
C: ASTRID
D: Desert Blue, possibly slate grey 4Runner. More of a light concrete. The color of a box of Bareskin Trojans. Crumpled Polaroid found at the scene. Possibly a clue?
E: CONT'D beat beat
C: LIBBY
D: Slouching adult male, 6’2, hunched shoulders. Seemed sad. Thoughtful.
E: beat MORE
C: LIBBY
D: Why was he sneaking out of Candace’s house? Who are you, Mr. Man?
E: CONT'D
C: ASTRID
D: Candace. Cheating on sexy boyf, Tate?
N: Libby pulls into her driveway.
C: LIBBY
D: Standby.
N: As they exit the car the CAMERA PANS TO: The ABNORMALLY LARGE PINK MOON.
S: INT. LIBBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The girls creep into Libby’s room, careful not to wake her parents.
S: INT. LIBBY'S BEDROOM, AKA PUDGE PATROL HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
N: This is not the room of a cool kid. The walls are covered in dated bands and TV show posters, mostly Alias, Detective Olivia Benson from SVU, Xena, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There are bookshelves full of their old notebooks and trunks full of Astrid’s spy and science lab equipment since she can’t keep it at her house. There are also rows of health and diet books. This is their sanctuary. A sign sits center stage on the wall. It reads PUDGE PATROL. They own this title, but no one else is allowed to use it. Libby sits on the floor, Astrid falls into the beanbag chair. Libby grabs the notebook, her turn to write.
C: LIBBY
D: Proceed.
N: Back to their ‘talking AT each other.’
C: ASTRID
D: Sparrow. Objectively the most attractive guy in 11th grade. Chiseled abdomen. 6-pack. Nay, 9- pack. Trying something new with his luscious locks, shinier than usual. Auburn chest hair scattered in between two heaving and defined -
C: LIBBY
D: Yeah I think we’re done here.
E: interrupting
N: Astrid laughs and hits play on some Billie Eilish as Libby assesses their notes. They nailed it.
C: LIBBY
D: Huh. Not sure I get it, but okay. You really think us blasting music like this in college is actually gonna make people want to hang out with us?
E: CONT'D re: the music
C: ASTRID
D: I mean, it might? Kids today! I dunno, Libs. Thought the whole point was to figure out how to blend in and not be so “us.”
E: serious
C: LIBBY
D: But I love us.
C: ASTRID
D: Just like I love Sparrow’s creamy- white translucent skin? I love us too, Libs.
E: off Libby’s look
N: Astrid clicks around on her laptop.
C: ASTRID
D: Ummm, you have to feed iguanas live crickets... Which could be scientifically interesting so therefore cool?
E: CONT'D
N: Beat as they look at each other. No way. Astrid puts on rubber gloves from her pocket and pulls the crumpled Polaroid from her bag.
C: ASTRID
D: I’m gonna pull prints off this tomorrow, just in case.
E: CONT'D
C: LIBBY
D: Good call.
N: Astrid places the Polaroid into their PATROL TROPHY BOX, a box of ‘evidence’ labeled “Trophies” and completely hidden in the back of Libby’s closet. Astrid rifles through the box, picks up something shiny-
C: ASTRID
D: Awww, Sparrow’s first nipple ring.
N: A sudden interloper in their safe space: KAITLIN, Libby’s little sister, 12-going-on-40, a lanky, know-it-all tween, wearing a Bluetooth earpiece.
C: KAITLIN
D: You know, Sparrow’s going to the party tonight.
C: LIBBY
D: Kaitlin! Get out of my roo--
C: ASTRID
D: What party tonight?
E: hormones in full effect
C: KAITLIN
D: The party at Tate’s.
C: LIBBY
D: How do you know this, you’re 12?
C: KAITLIN
D: I’m connected.
E: shrugs
C: LIBBY
D: But it’s a Sunday night!
C: KAITLIN
D: It’s what the cool kids are doing.
E: shrugs
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TATE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The sounds of a kickin’ suburban house party are in full effect. Astrid scopes the house eagerly. Libby doesn’t look convinced.
C: ASTRID
D: And here we are! And Sparrow’s in there, and I look fly as hell. And I KNOW there’s some hunnies in there dying to get a piece of your jelly.
C: LIBBY
D: I don’t know.
C: ASTRID
D: I DO know.
N: This makes Libby laugh.
S: INT. TATE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Everything looks expensive, cold grey tones. No parents in sight. They slowly step inside, looking at each other like, “Omg we’re doing this!” VALERIE, 16, drama club, wiping tears from her eyes, hands the girls cups.
C: VALERIE
D: Oh, hey guys! Out on a Sunday. Rock and roll, ladies.
E: to the girls, thru tears
C: ASTRID
D: Thanks!
C: LIBBY
D: Uhh, are you-
C: VALERIE
D: For the millionth time I’m not crying! It’s allergies!!
N: Candace and her boyfriend, TATE, 16, dreamy soccer stud, are weirdly feeling each other’s butts, UNDER their jeans. Tate stumbles drunkenly. Astrid STARES at them as they walk past.
C: ASTRID
D: They’re totally having sex, right? I hate that he’s so hot. I bet his butt feels like a hard dinner roll or like the curve of a ripe plum or maybe two peeled honeydew melons.
N: Candace is aware Astrid is staring.
C: CANDACE
D: What’re you staring at, FatAsstrid?
N: Libby WINCES for her friend.
C: TATE
D: Make way! Pudge Patrol, coming through.
E: old-fashioned bow
N: A few kids laugh. Libby and Astrid are immediately deflated.
C: ASTRID
D: Blow it off. Let’s just keep going.
N: The girls head into the - LIVING ROOM The girls awkwardly stand in a sea of cliques. Astrid nervously chugs her beer. Libby stares blankly at hers. Sparrow sips a beer in the corner. Astrid and Sparrow lock eyes for a (lusty, was it?) split-second.
C: ASTRID
D: I swear to God he just looked at me. Libby gives her friend an encouraging mini high-five.
E: CONT'D
N: Candace and Tate are quietly arguing. We can’t hear it yet. KITCHEN Candace is visibly upset, Tate is visibly drunk.
C: CANDACE
D: It’s not my fault my mom won’t let me go to Formal.
C: TATE
D: Since when do you do what she says?
C: CANDACE
D: I don’t. I’m just trying to keep the peace so I can get her to let me go to LA this summer.
C: TATE
D: And if you stayed, you’d be stuck with me. I get it.
C: CANDACE
D: That’s not what I said!
C: TATE
D: Whatever. You should just leave town. I mean why even stay. You wanna start a new life, go.
C: CANDACE
D: You’re being such an asshole.
N: Tate storms off. Libby is accidentally staring at Candace.
C: CANDACE
D: Why do you guys keep staring at me?
E: CONT'D
C: LIBBY
D: Nothing, I just, I-- Are you okay?
C: CANDACE
D: Gross.
N: Libby watches Candace leave, then-
C: LIBBY
D: Can we just go home?
C: ASTRID
D: Sure, they are officially killing my Sparrow-boner.
N: The Girls head out to- FRONT PORCH Tate is drunk, siting on the steps.
C: TATE
D: What’re you looking at. Stupid spying creepers. Why do you even do that? And why are you even here? I didn’t invite you.
E: slurring a little beat
C: ASTRID
D: Don’t worry about it, we’re outa here.
N: The girls turn to leave but he keeps at it.
C: TATE
D: I mean, look at you. You should do us all a favor and just stay in your little weird patrol car and never come out.
C: ASTRID
D: You’re a monster.
C: TATE
D: Oh yeah? Check out a mirror.
E: laughing
S: INT. LIBBY’S CAR - A LITTLE LATER
N: Libby is wiping away tears. Astrid looks FURIOUS.
C: ASTRID
D: I hate that asshole. I wish he’d just evaporate.
C: LIBBY
D: Goddammit, I’m so sick of being treated like we’re sub-human.
N: Astrid grabs her hand and gives it a squeeze.
C: ASTRID
D: Me too. But you know we’re not, right? We’re awesome. Maybe they’re the sub-humans and we’re the normal ones.
E: beat
C: LIBBY
D: But what he said...about the mirror. Are we really that gross? Is that really how everyone sees us?
C: ASTRID
D: No. Why? Just because we have a few extra luscious curves? And weird fun extracurriculars? No no no no no. I refuse to let some idiot chodebag tell us who we are. He doesn’t even know us. And what, he gets to be a total dick to us because his butt is hard and he kicks a ball around a field? What is that even?
N: Beat.
C: LIBBY
D: You know what might make us feel better?
S: EXT. LIBBY’S BACKYARD - LATER
N: The girls sit in Libby’s backyard. Eerie sounds of owls and bats echo. A GIANT PINK MOON and a WEIRD GLOW fill the sky. In between them: the Trophy Box. Libby grabs an item labeled “TATE’S HACKY SACK” from the box.
C: LIBBY
D: Let’s burn the bitch.
C: ASTRID
D: Whoa! I’m liking this fury.
N: Libby grabs a copper ashtray, sets the Hacky sack inside. She sprinkles some dirt on for good measure. Astrid appreciates the pomp and circumstance, and so plucks a nearby flower, and scatters the petals over the Hacky sack and dirt. Libby places a piece of bark on top of the pile and looks at Astrid. They nod, satisfied. Libby strikes a match, tosses it onto the “sacrifice.” It LIGHTS UP in a FIREY BLAZE. They start relishing in the ritualism of it all. They look at each other with wild excited eyes. Libby stands up and starts spinning.
C: LIBBY
D: We want you all to just disappear!
N: Astrid jumps up and starts spinning too.
C: ASTRID
D: Oooh yeah. We want Tate to just evaporate!
E: beat
N: Now they’re really feelin’ it- they act out all their “instructions.”
C: LIBBY
D: Now raise your hands up and make sea kelp arms! Here, grab my hands!
N: She does.
C: LIBBY
D: Now lean back!
E: CONT'D
C: ASTRID
D: Now stare up at the moon and howl!
N: They HOWL the fuck out of it. Releasing all their hard-won fury into the night sky.
C: LIBBY
D: And now say “We want you all to evaporate.”
C: ASTRID
D: And on the count of three say it backwards!
C: LIBBY
D: 1, 2, 3 -
N: They laugh at the ridiculousness of it all as they awkwardly stumble through saying it backwards.
C: LIBBY AND ASTRID
D: Etaropave...ot...lla...ouy...tnaw ...ew?
N: A LOUD BOOM as a LIGHTNING BOLT lights up the night sky, breaking their ritual vibe. A crazy-looking MASS OF SPIKEY CLOUDS comes into view and a WEIRD MAGENTA GLOW takes over. It doesn’t look natural. At all. Astrid and Libby look at each other.
C: LIBBY
D: Weird.
C: ASTRID
D: Yeah, cool coincidence.
N: Astrid notices the time. It’s 10:15pm.
C: ASTRID
D: Shit! Curfew!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. LIBBY’S CAR - LATER
N: Libby stops the car at Astrid’s house, Astrid jumps out.
C: ASTRID
D: Thanks, pal. I feel so much better!
C: LIBBY
D: Me too! That was so fun.
N: As Libby drives away we CLOSE UP ON a GLOWING BLOB OF RED GOO being sucked down a drainage gate as a MONSTER HAND WITH LONG CLAWLIKE FINGERNAILS closes the grate behind it, disappearing out of sight.
S: EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT
N: A CRYING WOMAN, 30s, sits on a bus stop bench by herself, quietly sniffling. Just as she starts to pull a tissue from her purse, she is WHISKED from the bench into thin air, her orphaned tissue floating in the wind.
S: INT. ASTRID’S HOUSE - SAME
N: Astrid creeps up the stairs, passing the dozens of crosses and Jesus statues that line the hallway. TV is blaring from her parents’ bedroom.
C: NEWSCASTER
D: Coppers Cove residents are hunkering down as a surprise storm is set to hit our sleepy town...
E: O.S.
N: Astrid tiptoes to her bedroom, creaks open the door and -
C: ASTRID’S MOM JANET
D: Nothing good happens after ten, Astrid.
N: Astrid’s Mom JANET stands in the dark hallway, arms crossed.
C: ASTRID
D: Good doesn’t even start til ten, Mom!
E: as her door closes
N: Janet makes the sign of the cross.
S: EXT. STREET BY BRIGHTON CREEK TRAIL - NIGHT
N: Tate wanders drunkenly down the dark road, tears in his eyes.
C: TATE
D: ...stupid Candace...just gonna be alone...
E: drunken mumble
N: He looks up at the weirdly colored sky. WTF. He sees a SHADOWY FIGURE up ahead. The Shadowy Figure heads into Brighton Creek Trail. Tate stops, getting his bearings. Which way is home? Then, Tate hears a voice calling him from the trail. A low, hard to make out voice. He follows the voice into the trail. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO SCRIBBLED ACROSS THE SCREEN: M O ND AY
S: EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOTS OF COPPERS COVE - NEXT MORNING
N: The sky remains an odd shade of magenta. We see tree-lined streets with similar houses, the church from last night, and the high school: Promise Academy.
S: INT. LIBBY’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Libby stands at her sink, staring at herself in the mirror, wipes a bead of sweat from her forehead. Turns to go and, feeling a little woozy, braces herself against the wall. The weird lightning flashes again, and she YELPS as she SIMULTANEOUSLY gets a sharp Charley horse in her leg.
C: LIBBY
D: Ouch! What the?
S: INT. ASTRID'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Astrid sits up in bed, clearly smelling something sour. News blares from the other room, as usual.
C: NEWSCASTER
D: Local Crime Stoppers reported a missing woman, last seen crying at the city central bus station...
E: O.S.
N: Astrid closes her bedroom door, holds her nose, grimaces.
C: ASTRID
D: Yikes, Mom, what grossness are you cooking?
E: to herself
S: INT. PROMISE ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING
N: Establishing shots of Promise Academy. A private charter school that functions like a hippie Montessori. The lines between teacher and student are blurry. A group of GRUNGY KIDS sits in a circle, meditating near a sign-up sheet to learn how to grow your own hemp. A banner reads: “Proudly Cell Phone Free Since 2017” SOCCER JOCKS kick around a vegan leather ball. A sign for something called GATEWAY TO GOD - YOUTH GROUP. Sign says: ”Bracelet making tonight!” Several WELL-GROOMED KIDS high five, “Amen, broseph.”
C: ASTRID
D: If my mom pitches Gateway to God to me one more time...
C: LIBBY
D: Ugh, sorry, dude.
N: TWO RANDOM STONERS wander past Libby and Astrid-
C: STONER 1
D: You see that weird round crazy lightning last night? Looked fake.
C: STONER 2
D: Dude, I thought I was just stoned.
N: Libby clocks this, a little concerned. Astrid disregards.
S: INT. PROMISE ACADEMY AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS
N: RAJ VARSHIDI, 50s, Indian, wants badly to be liked, stands at the podium, teachers behind him. He starts snapping his fingers, kids join in. This is how this school quiets down.
C: VARSHIDI
D: Good morning, Honey Badgers! A couple big announcements this A.M! First of all, the big event you’ve all been waiting for... Midterms! JK, gang! The Soccer Formal! Without further ado... Michelle!
E: waiting for laughs
N: MICHELLE, 27, hot teacher who still shops at Forever 21, GRABS the mic. She fluffs her hair, notices she’s wearing the same dress as Candace, and subtly boosts her cleave.
C: MICHELLE
D: Soccer Formal tix are offish’ on sale. There’s a sign-up sheet outside my classroom. I’ll be announcing the Formal theme later this week, so make sure you write in a suggestion. And make them good this year, for once.
C: VARSHIDI
D: Yes, m’aam! And finally, a word from our sponsors...Please welcome: Badgers alumni, Dance Sponsors, and owners of Sun Buns Tanning!
N: NIGEL, 40s, trying but failing to look expensive, and GRANT, 30s, walking money, take to the podium.
C: NIGEL
D: Hey Badge--
C: GRANT
D: Actually, I’m the owner and my brother’s only the manager.
C: NIGEL
D: I run operations, but anyway- Hey Badgers. We’re offering a student discount until the Formal. Just flash your school ID. And the Honey Badger sign.
N: Libby leans over to Astrid.
C: LIBBY
D: I know it’s cliché, but I really want to go to the dance.
C: ASTRID
D: Me too, girl. Worst comes to worst, I’ll be your date.
C: LIBBY
D: What?? You? With moi? I’d be honored!
N: Libby notices Varshidi’s been suddenly beckoned to the corner by SIMONE SPILLER, 20s, Kristen Schaal type.
C: VARSHIDI
D: Counselor Simone, please go ahead.
N: Varshidi nods as Simone steps up to the microphone...
C: SIMONE
D: Guys, it’s probably nothing. But the police got a call from Tate Vanderberg’s father. Tate appears to be missing this morning. He probably just left early for soccer practice- but has anyone seen him today?
E: quieting the murmurs
N: Everyone turns to Candace, who shakes her head. Libby and Astrid look at each other like “weird.” EGGS, 17, a nerdy guy, on the spectrum, raises his hand and stands to speak.
C: EGGS
D: It’s statistically nearly impossible to find a missing person after 72 hours. If a person has been missing for 7 years in most states, they can be legally declared deceased--
C: VARSHIDI
D: OK! Thanks, Eggs, he’s probably fine, but you know, if you see something--
N: INSANE THUNDER cracks from outside, and Libby YELPS loudly - another simultaneous Charley horse. All eyes, embarrassingly, on her.
C: LIBBY
D: Sorry! Nothing! Sorry.
N: Bell RINGS. Kids file out to class. Michelle joins the soccer jocks, joking around like she’s one of them. Candace shuffles toward the door, dialing her phone...
C: TATE’S VOICEMAIL
D: You’ve reached the Tatemeister, you lucky s.o.b....You know what to do...Unless you’re a dumbass.
C: CANDACE
D: Tate? Where the hell are you!?
S: INT. DARK NONDESCRIPT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: The space is so dark you can barely tell it’s some sort of cavernous tunnel. Tate sits bound to a chair behind a locked holding cell. Tied up next to him: the Crying Woman from the bus stop. In the background, the faint sounds of... German techno music? And drink shakers? Both seem to be under a spell and both have a steady stream of tears running down their faces, directly into a GIANT FANCY MARTINI GLASS under each chair.
S: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
N: Kids flood the hallways heading to first period.
C: ASTRID
D: What was that outburst? You okay?
C: LIBBY
D: This is going to sound crazy, but Every time the lightning flashes, I get a spasm in my leg.
E: beat
N: They overhear Valerie gossiping with a couple THEATER KIDS.
C: THEATER GAL
D: Where do you think Tate is?
C: VALERIE
D: He was pretty wasted. I bet he passed out behind Arby’s again.
N: Valerie SNEEZES and wipes allergy tears from her eyes.
C: VALERIE
D: Damn allergies.
E: CONT'D
C: THEATER GUY
D: I mean, he’s kind of a dick, so who knows what he got himself into. I bet he has a sidepiece in the city.
C: THEATER GAL
D: I heard he was legit crying when he disappeared from his own party.
N: Libby elbows Astrid, half-joking.
C: LIBBY
D: You don’t think we did that, right?
C: ASTRID
D: Ha, I wish we had the power to make assholes disappear!
S: INT. SCIENCE CLASS - DAY
N: Pretty high-tech for high school. Each desk has a full lab set. Libby and Astrid take their seats. FRANK FRICK, 30s, nerdy and loveable, notices a large jar set up on a desk with the sign, “Mr. Frick Date Fund.”
C: FRICK
D: Very funny, guys. I don’t need a date fund. Already got a hot date with my new fave portable Bunsen Burner, Bunny!
E: patting the fancy piece of equipment on his desk
N: GROANS from students. Frick laughs.
C: FRICK
D: If any of you touch her, I am not responsible for my actions, capiche? She was a gift from my friend
E: CONT'D whispered
C: At NASA.
D: Astrid starts setting up their lab.
C: ASTRID
D: Omg, what is that smell? Horseradish?
C: LIBBY
D: I don’t smell anything.
C: ASTRID
D: You don’t!? How?
N: Eggs eagerly shoots his hand up into the air.
C: EGGS
D: Hey, Mr. Frick, Mr. Frick!
C: MR. FRICK
D: Yes, Eggs.
C: EGGS
D: Mr. Frick, how come the storm clouds today don’t look anything like standard Cumulonimbus clouds?
C: ASTRID
D: It’s probably because the thermal rose so quickly.
N: Another FLASH and Libby YELPS again, manages to stifle it.
C: ASTRID
D: Seriously, what is going on with you?
E: CONT'D
C: LIBBY
D: I don’t know!
N: Libby looks toward the windows: The clouds are TOTALLY UNNATURAL spikey balls, and the sky is a color definitely not usually found in nature...
S: INT. PHOTOGRAPHY CLASSROOM - SAME
N: Students set up their photography projects on the display wall. Libby stands at the window, adjusting a camera lens while focusing outside. Something GIANT rustles in the trees. She pauses, zooms in closer and...it’s gone. HMM, creepy. The teacher, JONAS, late 30s, man bun, tinkers at his desk. Candace approaches him.
C: CANDACE
D: Thank you again for last night.
C: JONAS
D: No sweat. Just keep it on the DL, please. They’re in the back.
N: Candace grabs a stack of racy photos of herself from the back closet, shoves them in folders. Libby watches the exchange, whispering into her tiny recorder.
C: LIBBY
D: I think I know whose Blue 4-Runner was at Candace’s last night. And I am shocked to my core.
C: EGGS
D: What are you doing?
C: LIBBY
D: Jesus. Nothing, Eggs. Mind your beeswax.
E: startled
N: Libby analyzes Candace’s shots of Tate on the display wall. Then secretly pulls out her recorder. Candace clocks Libby’s recorder. Libby clocks Candace clocking her.
C: LIBBY
D: Cool photo.
E: CONT'D
N: Candace totally ignores her, turns back to her desk. Libby rolls her eyes. This bitch.
S: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY OUTSIDE MICHELLE’S CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Astrid watches Sparrow stare at the sign on Michelle’s door, “Soccer Formal Committee. Sign up here! No Nerds. JK LOL.” He signs up. Astrid immediately takes the last spot.
S: INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
N: It’s pizza day. Libby and Astrid wait in line.
C: LIBBY
D: I definitely saw rustling in the woods, though.
C: ASTRID
D: Did you fall asleep watching Twilight Zone again?
E: laughing
N: RUDE KID cuts in front of them.
C: RUDE KID
D: Gotta get a jump on the pepperoni before Pudge Patrol cleans it out.
N: Several kids laugh. Libby’s face goes BEET red. Astrid rolls her eyes at Rude Kid, grabs their slices to go.
C: ASTRID
D: Come on, let’s get outta here.
S: INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - DAY
N: The girls are huddled into a stall munching on pizza. This is their office and secret lunch room.
C: ASTRID
D: It’s like, get some new material already.
C: LIBBY
D: I just wish it didn’t sting every time.
C: ASTRID
D: I know. Okay, so, what do you want to do tonight? Some light breaking and entering, perhaps?
N: The bathroom door OPENS and we hear the unmistakable CLICKS of Michelle shoes. She’s with her shadow, Counselor Simone. Libby and Astrid freeze as Michelle and Simone pee.
C: MICHELLE
D: I hope Tate’s okay. He’s obvi my ideal court king for Formal!
C: SIMONE
D: So I have some goss. I could get into so much trouble for this and the hubs could get fired-
C: MICHELLE
D: Oooh dish. Pinky swear I won’t say anything. You know you’re my bff- esty. 4L.
E: manipulative AF
C: SIMONE
D: I know. Apparently a few officers got called to Brighton Creek Trail. They found Tate’s school ID... But no sign of him. It’s like he “evaporated” or something.
E: blushing and flattered
N: Michelle and Simone leave just as another MAGENTA LIGHTNING CRACK illuminates the already bright sky and Libby YELPS.
C: LIBBY
D: Holy shit, Astrid. “Evaporated?”
C: ASTRID
D: Libs, it’s a common word, a coincidence! Speaking of, you gotta stop with the psychosomatic guilt yelps.
C: LIBBY
D: They’re not psychosomatic and they hurt like hell. You don’t feel weird at all?
E: beat
C: ASTRID
D: No. I mean, the smell of breakfast made me extra nauseated this morning, but what else is new?
C: LIBBY
D: What about science class? Horseradish?
C: ASTRID
D: We didn’t do anything. We burned a Hacky sack, we danced around in the yard and yelled some stuff into the universe. People do it all the time.
E: deflecting
C: LIBBY
D: Can we just go check it out tonight? For science?
E: raising an eyebrow
S: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - AFTER SCHOOL
N: Kids fight through the storm to get into cars and busses. Candace, holding a FOLDER, follows Several Kids into A BIG WHITE VAN labeled: “GATEWAY TO GOD.” Candace’s Mom CHRISTINE, early 40s Tracy Flick type, loads the van. She wears a bracelet that reads, ‘What Would CHRISTine Do?’
C: CHRISTINE
D: Now who here pissed off God today and made him cry?
N: She laughs at her own joke and adjusts her hair.
C: CANDACE
D: Mom.
E: rolling her eyes
C: CHRISTINE
D: What’s in the portfolio? Those better not be the modeling photos I told you not to take.
C: CANDACE
D: No. It’s homework.
N: Christine closes the van doors and spots a poster: “Soccer Formal Tickets On Sale Now!” She makes sure no one is looking, RIPS the poster off the wall. She adjusts her pearls and SMILES, jumping into the driver’s seat.
S: EXT. PROMISE ACADEMY BACK PARKING LOT - LITTLE LATER
N: Valerie SNEEZES as she leans against the brick wall by the school theater exit. She’s totally alone, smoking a cig and wiping her consistently watery eyes. She sneezes again. The lot is empty. She hears a NOISE off to the side like NAILS ON A CHALKBOARD, turns to look and is CONFRONTED BY A LARGE BEING WE CAN’T SEE. Eyes wide, she’s TERRIFIED. And locked in a trance. LOW SCARY RASPY VOICE (O.S.) Hello Valerie. Alone again. Like always. (MORE) LOW SCARY RASPY VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) A shame that your dramatic and annoying personality pushes everyone away. A shame that you have no one. No one at all. Tears start STREAMING down her cheeks. Two LARGE BEASTLY HANDS with LONG CLAWS extend out toward her face. LOW SCARY RASPY VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) I could drink you right up. In fact, I think I will. A LONG DISGUSTING TONGUE SLOBBERS over her cheeks, licking her tears, leaving a trail of RED GLOWING GOO. She falls to the ground, unconscious, and is DRAGGED AWAY.
S: INT. LIBBY'S HOUSE - DINNER
N: Libby and Astrid chow down with Libby’s parents and siblings, PAM (MOM), late 40s, wearing RN scrubs, HEIDI (MA), late 40s, and sister Kaitlin. Little brother JOEY, 5, makes a mess. Libby, Astrid and Kaitlin scarf their food.

S: INT. DARK NONDESCRIPT SPACE - NIGHT
N: Tate and Crying Woman watch as an unconscious body is dragged into the lair. We see it’s Valerie. TECHNO MUSIC and PARTY LIGHTS are in full swing. Tate and Crying Woman both have tears streaming down their faces and into their martini glasses.
C: TATE
D: Why can’t I stop crying?
C: CRYING WOMAN
D: I don’t know. I can’t either. Why am I weirdly attracted to the hideous monster thing? I know he’s disgusting, but is he also kinda... sexy? No, not sexy. Dangerous. Dangerous like a sexy daddy. Who deals party drugs. Like Predator with extra long claws and a sexy Timothy Olyphant vibe, right?
E: through nonstop tears
C: TATE
D: Gross but yes exactly.
E: through tears
N: An IMPOSING FIGURE pops in, looming over them... And then turning, we finally see it. The TEARJERKER! It is otherworldly, a monster not of this Earth. It stands tall over them, SCARY AS HELL. But also kinda sexy.
C: TEARJERKER
D: You’ve never been more right, my babies. And I’ll tell you why you can’t stop crying... Because you’re excellent party guests!
E: beat
N: They’re both like WTF? He reaches a 12-inch claw fingernail under Tate’s chair and stirs the tear-martini, then licks off a delicious taste.
C: TEARJERKER
D: Almost ready...
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. BRIGHTON CREEK TRAIL - NIGHT
N: Libby and Astrid tiptoe from the car toward the trail entrance. They poke around the caution tape.
C: ASTRID
D: What exactly are we looking for?
C: LIBBY
D: Not sure. But I think that flag marks where Tate’s ID was found...
N: They tiptoe closer to the YELLOW FLAG marker... The girls realize they’re crouched in a puddle of RED GOO. It looks thick like gelatinous phlegm. Libby has to cover her mouth to stop from gagging. Her leg spasms.
C: LIBBY
D: Ouch, my leg again! What is this stuff?
E: CONT'D
C: ASTRID
D: I honestly have no idea.
E: sniffing
C: LIBBY
D: It’s disgusting. So squishy.
N: Astrid sniffs around some more.
C: ASTRID
D: Smells almost like burnt pickles.
C: LIBBY
D: I think my leg’s reacting to it.
N: Libby and Astrid dig around the caution tape with sticks. Something shiny GLEAMS under a leaf pile. Libby leans down.
C: LIBBY
D: Um, Astrid, I got something!!
E: CONT'D
N: Astrid comes running over, leans to get a better look.
C: ASTRID
D: Is that a broken fingernail? A 12-inch long broken fingernail?
E: beat, huh?
N: Astrid holds up a slightly curved, 12-inch long hybrid between a claw and a perfectly manicured nail.
C: LIBBY
D: Looks like it? Bag it up?
E: more hesitation
N: Girls hear rustling and heavy breathing in the bushes. They look at each other. They’re in the clearing, nowhere to hide.
C: LIBBY
D: Hello...?
E: CONT'D beat, weakly
N: More rustling from the bushes. And GROWLING. They look at each other, TERRIFIED and then - A DARK HOODED FIGURE steps out from behind the trees. Girls SCREAM. And faint.
S: EXT. BRIGHTON CREEK TRAIL - LATER
N: Libby and Astrid wake up to CU on Dark Hooded Figure as he SLOWLY REMOVES HIS HOOD and - He’s HOT AF.
C: ASTRID
D: Oh shit, I’m gonna die at the hands of a hottie with a body.
N: Dark Hooded Figure laughs.
C: DARK HOODED FIGURE
D: Relax, I’m not gonna kill you. I’m actually here to save you from the thing that wants to kill you. So...you’re welcome.
C: LIBBY
D: Wait, what?
C: ASTRID
D: Who the hell are you and what do you mean THING THAT WANTS TO KILL US???
C: DARK HOODED FIGURE
D: Okay so, I’m Brutus. So, long story short, a portal to another dimension was opened up. A really bad, end of the world kind of dimension. Monsters. Bad guys. You know, like in the movies.
E: MORE
C: DARK HOODED FIGURE
D: Thing is, it didn’t just open up by itself.
E: CONT'D
N: Libby and Astrid look at each other.
C: BRUTUS
D: Turns out, the portal opened because of...you.
C: ASTRID
D: What?
C: LIBBY
D: I told you!!!
E: to Astrid
C: BRUTUS
D: Remember that spell you did? You know, when you were standing 7.2349567 feet away from each other, the copper, the fir tree bark, and then, the piece de resistance. You said, “Etaropave... ot... lla... ouy... tnaw ...ew.” and well, in Monster, that loosely translates to, “Open the portal.”
E: beat
C: LIBBY
D: It sounds much prettier when you pronounce it.
E: in shocked autopilot
C: BRUTUS
D: You really should have known better than to do all that on the 3rd Sunday of the 9th month during a pink moon, when Uranus was circling the wolf rays.
N: He looks at them like, duh.
C: BRUTUS
D: Anyway, because YOU opened it, YOU are the ONLY ones who can close it, or else humanity sorta disappears. No biggie.
E: CONT'D
N: Libby and Astrid exchange a look.
C: LIBBY
D: We were just messing around! It was all fake! We were just blowing off steam!
E: stunned
C: BRUTUS
D: B-T-dubs, who hurt you? The portal you opened is no joke and very hard to access. Must be a lot of pain swirling around you guys.
N: Libby and Astrid exchange another look.
C: ASTRID
D: Why should we believe you?
C: BRUTUS
D: Ugh, fine. Proof. I hate this part. Really messes up my faux hawk.
N: ALLOFASUDDEN, a GLOWING horn sprouts out of his forehead. Girls’ mouths HANG OPEN.
C: BRUTUS
D: I know. Not a good look.
E: CONT'D
C: ASTRID
D: Nice special effects makeup, tell Tate or Candace or whoever to kiss my fat ass. We’ll never ever go to one of their parties again. They win. Come on, Libby, let’s go. This dude’s psycho.
N: The girls turn to leave. Libby’s unsure, but starts walking with her friend...
C: BRUTUS
D: Look, I can’t force you to stay. Special rule number 6795C. But, the thing that has your friend is called a TEARJERKER and it targets anyone crying. The sadder you are, the more it wants you. It will say to you the deep dark thing you fear the most. And you really should...
E: stopping them briefly tossing Libby a PAMPHLET
N: They’re already running back to Libby’s car.
C: BRUTUS
D: ...know that your friend only has about 26 hours left.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. O’MALLEY’S PIZZERIA - NIGHT

D: You okay, Bro? Pizza isn’t that bad, is it?
S: INT. CHURCH REC ROOM - NIGHT
N: Christine supervises as a group of kids organize piles of her “What Would CHRISTine Do” bracelets.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Speaking of sin, let’s talk about the upcoming fertile ground for sin: the Soccer Formal.
N: Kids look around at each other, a few GROANS.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Don’t think I wasn’t young once. We all know what happens at these things and I’m here to ask you, what would you rather have inside you? The lord’s light or the devil’s penis?
E: CONT'D
N: A few kids laugh.
C: CANDACE
D: Jesus, Mom.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Exactly. Jesus. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go refill the punch.
S: INT. CHURCH MUD ROOM - SAME
N: Christine snoops through Candace’s backpack, finds her photos. Sexy influencer/Maxim Mag style shots. She holds her hand up-
C: CHRISTINE
D: I knew it! Lord, why have you forsaken me? Send me an angel of mercy to vanquish the devil teacher Jonas who took these disgusting photos. Before he becomes a worse influence on my precious daughter.
S: INT. LIBBY’S BEDROOM - LATER
N: Both Astrid and Libby are blank-faced, laying on Libby’s bed, staring up at the ceiling. Libby clutches the PAMPHLET.
C: ASTRID
D: That couldn’t have been for real, right? Someone’s screwing with us, right? Who do you think it is?
C: LIBBY
D: I honestly don’t know what to think.
C: ASTRID
D: What does it say again?
C: LIBBY
D: Rule 7.85b, closing the portal- Collect the following 13 body parts: a krivack from a Klorfus, an eyeball from a Memoragatu, the glog from a Slim-- and a bunch of other words I don’t understand.
N: Libby starts pacing, they’re each having their own convo.
C: ASTRID
D: Candace? Tate, even? Did someone see us in the yard last night? Are we not the only ones with night vision binocular masks??
C: LIBBY
D: What does this stuff even mean?
C: ASTRID
D: Definitely not Sparrow, of course. There must be a logical explanation for this. There always is.
E: beat
N: Beat as they resume talking TO each other.
C: LIBBY
D: Also...a horn...came out of his head.
C: ASTRID
D: Yeah, there is that. At first I thought maybe it was a Pilar cyst. But those don’t present like that.
N: Storm is ramping up outside.
C: LIBBY
D: What if, he was telling the truth?
C: ASTRID
D: But what about science?
C: LIBBY
D: But what about...everything else?
N: Beat.
C: ASTRID
D: Then that would mean....there are actually monsters in Coppers Cove and it’s all our fault.
C: LIBBY
D: And if that’s true, then something called a Tearjerker is eating people’s tears and he’s holding Tate hostage. And if it’s all our fault, and somehow Tate has been... um... taken...or hurt, then I guess...we need to stop people from crying....and...
C: ASTRID
D: Sonofabitch. We gotta find that asshole. How else will we know?
E: beat

D: No, she wasn’t on the bus.
C: LIBBY
D: Oh no, her allergies. It got Val!
S: INT. SCIENCE CLASS - DAY
N: Astrid hesitates, then approaches Mr. Frick at his desk as he polishes his “Bunny” Bunsen Burner.
C: ASTRID
D: Weird question.
C: MR. FRICK
D: Remember, there are-
C: ASTRID
D: No weird questions, right... Is there any chance monsters exist and there’s one that eats tears?
C: MR. FRICK
D: Ha! I needed a good laugh this morning. Where do you get this stuff?
S: INT. PHOTOGRAPHY CLASSROOM - MORNING
N: Libby studies her patrol journal at her desk, “subtly” examines the Tate photo across the room, and then takes more notes.

D: Oh, you’re talking to me now?
E: startled, then

N: Libby turns back around.
C: LIBBY
D: Right. Cool, have a nice life.
C: CANDACE
D: Sorry. No offense. You know, I only said the Pudge Patrol thing to Tate once as a joke. I didn’t think he would spread it.
E: beat beat

S: INT. NONDESCRIPT SCARY SPACE - CONTINUOUS
N: Tate, Valerie, Nigel, and Crying Woman are tied to chairs. A GIANT MARTINI GLASS under each one. Disco lights swirl above. Tearjerker dances as he finishes strapping Nigel into his chair, pepperoni stuck to Nigel’s shirt.
C: TEARJERKER
D: Damn I love these sweet beats.
C: NIGEL
D: Where am I?
C: TEARJERKER
D: At the party, baby. Aww, is Nigel sad because he’ll never be as rich and powerful as his little brother Granty-poo?
E: baby voice
C: NIGEL
D: Wha-wha-what are you-
N: Tearjerker GRABS Nigel by the face, gets thisclose. We see the horror in Nigel’s eyes.
C: TEARJERKER
D: It’s no use. I know you. And I know you’ll always be in his shadow. Always wanting what you’ll never be good enough to have.
N: Tears start STREAMING down Nigel’s face.
C: TEARJERKER
D: Speaking of wanting things!
E: CONT'D
N: Tearjerker steps back, suddenly lighthearted AF.
C: TEARJERKER
D: I know you’re not quite ready yet, but daddy wants a Teartini...
E: CONT'D
N: He walks back and forth between the victims, evaluating...
C: TEARJERKER
D: Hmmm, which one....
E: CONT'D
N: He grabs the martini glass underneath the Crying Woman, stirs it with his long fingernail, then takes a taste.
C: TEARJERKER
D: This’ll do.
E: CONT'D

C: TEARJERKER
D: Perfect.

E: scanning the crowd beat
N: Sparrow HUFFS and puts sunglasses on.
C: ASTRID

E: beat, to Sparrow beat

E: CONT'D beat
N: Astrid peeks in at what looks like a Bop-It floating within a glowing gaseous sphere.
C: ASTRID
D: Goddammit, Unicorn Boy. Way to pile it on. Can’t we just quietly ignore this all away?
C: LIBBY
D: I don’t think so.
C: ASTRID
D: Like we need another reason for everyone to think we’re freakshows.
C: MEAN KID WALKING BY
D: You are freakshows.
N: As Libby stares at the Orb, a tiny compartment opens and a teeny tiny doll-sized note falls out. Astrid grabs it-
C: ASTRID
D: Hello monster hunters-- Jesus-- Use me to hold the 13 body parts needed to close the portal.
E: reading
N: Beat as Astrid and Libby exchange a worried glance.
C: ASTRID
D: Step 1: retrieve the Tonton from the Tearjerker. And if you haven’t figured it out yet- follow your nose...and leg... AKA your new monster tracker superpowers! Seriously? These are the powers we get?
E: CONT'D beat
N: Libby picks up the Orb, turning it in her hands.
C: LIBBY
D: How does this work?
N: Libby hits a button. A RED BEAM shoots out, landing on a FLY. ALLOFASUDDEN, the fly GLOWS and grows to hamster size. From the recoil, she hits another button. A BLUE BEAM zaps a trashcan, making it DISAPPEAR. They look at each other in SHOCK as the FLY ZOOMS out a window.
C: ASTRID
D: I think you hit the wrong buttons. Time for some recon.
N: Libby nods in agreement. Astrid shoves the Orb into her bag.
S: EXT. STREETS OF COPPERS COVE - DAY

C: LIBBY
D: Okay well not sure why, but we gotta go in here.
C: ASTRID
D: Yeah I’m getting that same burnt vinegar smell. Let’s do it.
E: sniffing
S: INT. SUN BUNS TANNING SALON - LATER
N: Douchey fluorescent signs and aggressive lotion displays. Think Miami Beach in the 80s. Grant sets up for the day. Libby and Astrid walk in. Astrid clears her throat.
C: ASTRID
D: Hello, we’d like to order two tans please.
C: GRANT
D: Are you here from the high school?

D: When in Rome.
N: She strips down, puts on earbuds, gets into the tanning bed. LIBBY’S TANNING ROOM Libby starts opening drawers, nada. Then, she doubles over in pain, her leg is throbbing. HEARS CRYING. Oh shit, it’s coming from the next room.
S: NEXT DOOR TANNING ROOM
N: Libby enters, entranced as she sees the TEARJERKER, headphones on and bopping his head to the beat, SCRAPE the TEARS of A TANNING WOMAN with his 12-inch CLAW FINGERNAIL and snort it like it’s cocaine. LIBBY GASPS, which STARTLES the Tearjerker. He turns toward her, delighted.
C: TEARJERKER
D: Well look who it is. It’s my number one portal-opening party girl.
C: LIBBY
D: No..I...
C: TEARJERKER
D: I know you’re normally not invited to parties... Oh no, did I hit a nerve? You’re not going to cry are you?

C: TEARJERKER
D: Shit that’s good.
E: CONT'D drug high
C: LIBBY
D: Please...
E: through tears
N: Instantly, the Creature has her in a trance-like state.
C: TEARJERKER
D: You don’t have to ask me twice. You know why you’re going to be extra yummy? Because you hate yourself... Sad tastes good, but worthless is delicious.
C: LIBBY
D: I’m not...
C: TEARJERKER
D: Sure you are, gf.
N: She slumps to the floor, SOBBING, unable to look away. ASTRID’s ROOM Astrid jams to relaxing music in her tanning bed, oblivious that her purse is starting to VIBRATE and GLOW.

C: ASTRID
D: Libby!
N: LIBBY’S ROOM Outside the door, Astrid BANGS and screams Libby’s name. But then we’re back with Libby - all we hear is Libby breathing as the Tearjerker stares into her eyes, licking her tears.
C: TEARJERKER
D: Ready to move the party to my crib?
N: But then! Astrid BUSTS into the room with the Orb! She pushes a button - a laser shoots out, EXPLODING THE CREATURE’S TONGUE, which sprays a disproportionate amount of RED GOO directly onto the girls. The Tanning Woman snaps out of her trance and RUNS out the door. The Tearjerker’s TONGUE starts to regenerate in his mouth, but Astrid has JUST enough time to grab Libby and HAUL ASS. TANNING SALON LOBBY Grant looks up just as Astrid and Libby, covered in RED GOO, beeline for the front door. What the?
C: ASTRID LIBBY
D: Lady problems. Homeopathic tanning lotion.
S: INT. LIBBY’S CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Both girls are hyperventilating and COVERED IN GOO as Astrid speed-drives them away. Libby is still coming to.
C: ASTRID
D: He got away.
C: LIBBY
D: You saved my life.
C: ASTRID
D: I’m so so sorry. You were right, this shit’s real. It’s all real. Holy crap I’m so glad you’re okay. I was so scared I lost you.
N: Libby reaches out to squeeze Astrid’s hand.
C: ASTRID
D: What...happened in there? You looked...so sad.
E: CONT'D
C: LIBBY
D: It was awful. He told me the truth...what I already know... That I’m...worthless.
E: tearing up
N: Astrid pulls the car over and looks at her friend.
C: ASTRID
D: Libby, you’re the farthest thing from worthless. You’re the most important person in my life.
C: LIBBY
D: Why do so many people keep saying it to me if it’s not true?
E: in tears
C: ASTRID
D: Because some people are idiots. And that thing’s a monster. And you were the only person smart enough to see what was happening. And who could be worthless with such a badass leg cramp superpower?
N: Libby laughs and they hug.
C: ASTRID
D: Now, how do we kill this psycho buttface monster thing?
E: CONT'D
N: Libby pulls the pamphlet from her backpack, scanning.
C: LIBBY
D: Okay, 13 monster body parts, place them in Orb, close the portal, yada, yada... Tearjerker! Found it, okay... Listen to this: Step 1: incapacitate Tearjerker, cut out his Tonton, Step 2: set him on fire...
E: reading
S: INT. GIRLS LOCKER ROOM - LATER
N: Astrid finishes the pamphlet aloud as she and Libby wipe themselves down with shitty locker room paper towels.
C: ASTRID
D: Yep, “Cut out his Tonton, set him on fire.” Cool. Easy peasy. Clear as day.
C: BRUTUS
D: I see you found what I left in your mailbox.
N: Both girls JUMP. Brutus is suddenly there. The creepy Giant Fly buzzes in and lands on his shoulder.
C: ASTRID
D: It’s called a locker. And it’s extremely public.
N: Brutus hands them a bottle.
C: BRUTUS
D: Just came to bring you this. Mix it with elephant tranquilizer. It’ll knock the Tearjerker right out.
C: LIBBY
D: Elephant tranq-?
N: Astrid nods and winks “got this” at Libby, takes the bottle.
C: LIBBY
D: And, you sure he has Tate? And Valerie? And those other people who went missing?
E: CONT'D
C: BRUTUS
D: Yes, but he distills victims for 48 hours before he kills them. To wring as much despair out of them as possible. For when he drains and drinks all their remaining bodily fluids.
E: off their confused look still confused
C: ASTRID LIBBY
D: Ah. Ah.
E: finally understanding finally understanding
C: BRUTUS
D: So you still have... 8 hours left to get to them. And remember, if you don’t get the Tonton, you can’t close the portal and the world will die. Good luck!
E: looking at his watch beat
N: He and the fly both disappear.
S: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
N: Libby and Astrid beeline down the hallway, passing Sparrow.
C: SPARROW
D: Astrid.
N: She stops and turns around. Sparrow looks at her funny.
C: ASTRID
D: What?
E: OMG
C: SPARROW
D: You have a little something in your hair...
N: He gestures toward her hair. She wipes the red goo, mortified.
C: SPARROW
D: Is that, blood?
E: CONT'D
C: ASTRID
D: Um, I think so.
C: SPARROW
D: Cool.
N: She smiles to herself and keeps running. MONTAGE: SCIENCE LAB -Astrid picks the lock on the chem cabinet and mixes Methanol and Propanoyl chloride into the BOTTLE Brutus gave them. -Astrid runs to Frick’s desk, mouths “Sorry” in his direction, shoves his precious PORTABLE BUNSEN BURNER into Libby’s backpack. Several kids stare at them like they’re freaks. BIKE RACK OUTSIDE SCHOOL -Astrid grabs 2 helmets. Libby leaves several notes that say “Will return your helmet, promise. Unless we’re dead.”
C: GAS STATION
D: -Libby fails at looking super nonchalant as she pumps some gasoline into a Super Soaker Water Gun.
N: LIBBY’S BEDROOM -They face Libby’s mirror, wearing every clothing item they have, for padding. Plus kitchen gloves, stolen bike helmets and each holding a water gun. They look like nerdy badasses. END MONTAGE.
S: INT. LIBBY'S BEDROOM - LATER
N: Libby is digging through her backpack.
C: ASTRID
D: Steel dagger.
C: LIBBY
D: Check.
C: ASTRID
D: Turkey baster.
C: LIBBY
D: Check. Last thing on the list. Think we’re finally ready. What if I’m not ready? I honestly don’t know if I can do this, Astrid.
E: beat
C: ASTRID
D: You’re stronger than you think.
N: Kaitlin pops her Blue-toothed head in.
C: KAITLIN
D: Heard you and Sparrow had a real moment today.
C: LIBBY
D: How do you-
C: KAITLIN
D: I told you, I have eyes everywhere.
S: EXT. BEHIND THE PET STORE - NIGHT
N: The girls stand over a drainage grate.
C: ASTRID
D: We sure this is it?
C: LIBBY
D: Yeah, my leg is killing me.
N: Astrid deeply SNIFFS around.
C: ASTRID
D: Yep, this is the spot. He can douse himself in all the Drakkar he wants, I can still smell him.
N: Libby removes the grate.
C: LIBBY
D: I’m scared.
C: ASTRID
D: I’m right behind you. You and me, Libs. We’re the only ones who can save the world. Just us. Kinda cool when you think about it.
C: LIBBY
D: Maybe being us ain’t so bad. Pudge Patrol, armed and ready for mega ass-kicking.
N: They strap on their night vision binocular goggles, high five, then quietly slip under the grate and into the lair.
S: INT. MONSTER’S LAIR - SAME
N: Libby and Astrid peer around a wall. They see the victims in the locked cell crying uncontrollably. Valerie can’t stop sneezing.
C: LIBBY
D: Val! And, is that the tanning guy?
C: ASTRID
D: I think so. Imma get into position.
N: Libby nods as Astrid hides behind some boxes. Libby removes her night vision goggles, opens Brutus’s bottle and uses a turkey baster to drip the liquid down her cheeks a la tears. Then she waltzes out into the lair!
C: LIBBY
D: Oh, misery! These tears fall so freely from all the pain!!!!
E: drama like soap opera
C: TEARJERKER
D: A surprise guest! Delightful!
E: O.S.
N: ALLOFASUDDEN from behind her- champagne cork POPPING.
C: TEARJERKER
D: When the tears hit your fangs, it’s so good.
E: CONT'D
N: Tearjerker slowly approaches Libby. She TREMBLES, locked in his gaze. She tilts her tear-soaked cheek in his direction.
C: TEARJERKER
D: Perhaps an aperitif before we spar?
E: CONT'D
N: Tearjerker extends his giant prehensile tongue and slowly laps her cheeks.
C: TEARJERKER
D: Yum. I’d love to take this to the next level. But first, a tune...
E: CONT'D
N: He clicks a button on his juke box. German techno fills the space. The Tearjerker starts gyrating and turns to face Libby. Why’s he wide awake!?!? And then - He SLUMPS to the ground with a THUD.
C: LIBBY
D: Oh, thank God. Astrid runs back in.
C: ASTRID
D: We gotta work fast.
C: LIBBY
D: You go pick the lock, I guess I’ll start dissecting.
N: Libby kneels down beside the beast and cuts a square open on his chest. She is immediately DOUSED with red goo. She GAGS.
C: LIBBY
D: Astrid, I need your help! I can’t see a thing and I’m totes gonna barf.
E: CONT'D
N: Astrid finishes picking the holding cell lock and runs up to a confused and weak Tate.
C: ASTRID
D: Quick, we don’t have much time. Exit’s that way. I gotta finish this. Astrid steps over dead Crying Woman and mouths “R.I.P.”
E: pointing
S: INT. LAIR HALLWAY - SAME
N: Tate, Valerie and Nigel rush down the hallway, their tears finally slowing to a trickle.
S: INT. MONSTER LAIR - SAME
N: Astrid, now fully covered in GOO, holds up the Tonton.
C: ASTRID
D: Got it!
N: They drop it into the ORB, which beeps and whirs shut.
C: ASTRID
D: Look on the bright side, only 13 more of these and we can close the portal...
E: CONT'D
C: LIBBY
D: Great. Just in time for Formal.
N: Over the SLOW, MELANCHOLY Ursine Vulpine cover of Chris Isaac’s Wicked Game: The monster’s GIGANTIC eyes flip open, and the girls SCREAM! As his tongue rapidly regenerates:
C: TEARJERKER
D: Now why’d you have to go ruin a perfectly good party?
E: mumbled and subtitled
N: He BOLTS upright, body and tongue healed. Huge Joker smile. The girls are FROZEN.
C: TEARJERKER
D: You’ve made me mad. And do you know what I do when I get mad? I dance!
E: CONT'D beat
N: He jiggles around for a few seconds.
C: TEARJERKER
D: And then I dine.
E: CONT'D patronizing
N: He LUNGES at them, GROWLING and displaying GIANT FANG TEETH. They all tumble to the floor, the Tearjerker on top of them. He turns pointedly to Astrid.
C: TEARJERKER
D: I can see why your Mom is so deeply ashamed of you.
E: CONT'D
C: LIBBY
D: No! Don’t listen to him!
N: Astrid starts to tear up.
C: TEARJERKER
D: That’s right. Lemme have it. Gimme your delicious tears, party girls.
N: He leans in to lap up the tears and -
C: LIBBY
D: Wait!
N: Tearjerker is thrown by her ballsiness and he stops.
C: LIBBY
D: We’ll give you what you want, but... what’ll you do when we’re dead? Your second course is ruined. He turns and is SHOCKED at the empty holding cell, releases his grip, giving Astrid just enough leeway to scramble away.
E: CONT'D indicating the cell
N: He’s FURIOUS, lunges back down to Libby’s face and -- Astrid SPRAYS him with the Super Soaker Water Gun full of gasoline. The spray confuses him long enough that he release his grip on Libby. He wipes his body, grimacing at the gasoline smell.
C: TEARJERKER
D: I dislike this proof.
N: He then LUNGES FOR ASTRID - But- Libby SPRAYS FIRE from the Portable Bunsen Burner, and the Tearjerker BURSTS INTO FLAMES. As he shrinks down, burning and dying, he CRIES A LOUD DESPERATE WAIL and CLUTCHES his eyes, crying, finally evaporating into ash.
C: ASTRID
D: I’ve officially decided parties are overrated.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT BEHIND PET STORE - SAME
N: Libby and Astrid are heavy breathing, covered in GOO, laying next to Tate and a passed-out Valerie.
C: LIBBY
D: Where’d the tanning dude go?
C: TATE
D: Dunno. He ran off. What happened?
E: beat
C: LIBBY
D: It’s a long story. Right now we just need to get you and Val home.
C: TATE
D: Who’s Val?
C: ASTRID
D: She goes to school with us. She was at your party.
E: incredulous
C: TATE
D: Really?
C: LIBBY
D: Maybe you need to get your head outta your ass.
C: TATE
D: I don’t really know what to say.
C: ASTRID
D: Well you could start by thanking us for drowning in monster guts to save your life. Don’t worry, we’re not gonna tell anyone. In fact, it’s probably a good idea if none of us talk about this...to anyone.
C: LIBBY
D: Cover story. Good idea.
C: TATE
D: Yeah sure, nobody would believe I spent more than five minutes with you guys anyway. We’re cool. Also, thanks.
E: then
N: Libby and Astrid share a look: this freakin’ guy.
C: ASTRID
D: Libby, could you pass me the Orb?
C: LIBBY
D: Sure.
N: Libby passes it to her and “accidentally” hits the button, dissolving a street lamp next to Tate. Who SHRIEKS and JUMPS.
C: LIBBY
D: Whoops.
E: CONT'D
N: Libby and Astrid smile at each other.
S: INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: Michelle and Varshidi at the podium, leading assembly.
C: MICHELLE
D: You guys picked a dumb theme for the dance, even though I asked you not to. So I chose something else. I’m super stoked to announce the new COOL theme...Angels & Demons!
C: ASTRID
D: A little on the nose?
N: Libby laughs.
C: VARSHIDI
D: And now, exciting announcement! Drum roll please, I’d like to welcome back to Promise... your favorite Badger... Tate Vanderberg!
N: Tate comes BURSTING through a sports entrance banner.
C: VARSHIDI
D: Look who’s alive, you guys!
E: CONT'D
N: Room ERUPTS with clapping, shouting, etc.
C: KIDS
D: Speech! Speech! Speech!
N: Tate reluctantly grabs the mic.
C: TATE
D: Uh, thanks guys. Super happy to be back. Yo, reminder to everyone to wear a helmet when you go bouldering!... I do have someone to thank...Couldn’t have done it without them....
N: He looks over at Libby and Astrid, who smile.
C: TATE
D: Candy, baby, will you come up here?
E: CONT'D
C: LIBBY
D: I guess some things never change.
N: Candace BLUSHES and makes her way to the front, exchanging a subtle glance with Libby as she passes. Astrid clocks this.
C: ASTRID
D: Well some stuff changes. Like, I guess monsters are real.
E: loaded beat
C: LIBBY
D: Yeah, I guess we’re monster hunters now. Arguably cooler than iguanas and Billy Eilish.
C: ASTRID
D: I’m gonna get so much ass it’s gonna be freaky.
N: DUMB KID nearby.
C: DUMB KID
D: You guys are freaky.
C: ASTRID LIBBY
D: Thanks! Thanks!
S: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Valerie and Eggs wander by Libby’s locker.
C: VALERIE
D: I had the weirdest dream I was in a drug den with a sexy monster.
N: Libby opens her locker, and a note falls out. Revealing a sharp WEIRDLY SHAPED SWORD inside.
C: ASTRID
D: Again with the locker, Brutus!?
N: Libby picks up the note and reads it aloud...
C: LIBBY
D: Dear Hunters, we’ve had a breach. Keep eyes out for a Klorfus: A 999- toothed shapeshifter that flips its victims inside out. Xoxox, Brutus. He could maybe soften his delivery.
E: beat
C: ASTRID
D: I think there’s a photo on the back.
N: Libby turns over the note and both girls SCREAM. END PILOT TAG
S: INT. CHURCH REC ROOM - NIGHT
N: Christine organizes booklets, hears a noise from the chapel.
S: INT. CHAPEL - DAY
N: Christine pokes her head inside. It’s dark and empty. Hears noise again so she walks in.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Hello?
N: GROWLING from behind a pew.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Jamison if that’s you playing another one of your pranks, I will be forced to tell your mothe-
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly, Christine sees SOMETHING WE DON’T SEE and drops to her knees, raises her hands up-
C: CHRISTINE
D: Oh mighty lord and savior you have chosen me! What an...unusual looking angel of his mercy! Not at all what I expected but that is the magic of the lord. Oh heavenly father, you heard my prayers and are here to rid me of that evil teacher Jonas.
E: CONT'D beat
C: VOICE
D: I am here to serve. FINIS.
E: O.S. haunting AF voice
