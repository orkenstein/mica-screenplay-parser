D: 1 INT. SECURE WARD, PRISON HOSPITAL - DAWN 1
N: A plastic cigarette lighter is lit.
C: R
D: Into the flame light comes the heel of a shoe held by the shaking hand of an old man. The hands and wrists have
C: U bracelet tattoos. AT
D: A face leans into the light to see the black smoke begin to curl up from the heel of the shoe. Then drops of black melted rubber begin to drip from the shoe into a ceramic cup. The cup, the face and the hands are striped by orange light FE
N: coming from a light gantry outside. Rain dribbles on a barred window. We study the face in the light of the lighter. Wizened, in great pain but determined, with straggly grey hair. This man S is GORNI ZYKOV. The lighter could be a candle in an Old Masters painting, the face looks like a face from Rembrandt. U As the rubber drips Zykov reaches into the half light and gropes to find the tube of a CATHETER, which enters his penis C (out of shot) under his white robe (his crumpled robes look like a shroud in the half light). We now see that Zykov is FO lying in a hospital bed... He extracts the end of the catheter from a plastic flask attached to a drip scaffold and puts it into the cup. He grunts a little to release some urine. Urine flows through the catheter tube into the cup and mixes with the black melted rubber. Zykov gasps in pain and swirls the mixture. The lighter and a hand find a needle from a syringe hidden under a pillow. Zykov’s shaking hand grabs it and he lies back on the bed, striped by bars from above. He takes a deep breath and then pulls away the bed sheet. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 2. We see that his body has many tattoos, swirls and crosses and stars, but they flash in and out of the light. He begins to dig the tip of the needle into his own flesh. Once, twice, three times, as if injecting compulsively but never piercing the skin all the way. He curls to survey his work as blood pimples appear and he wipes the blood away on the sheet. We will learn he is working on a home made tattoo. He continues to prick and wipe his skin in a pattern which for now only he understands - dipping cotton wool into the jet black sludge of rubber and urine and applying the sludge
C: ES
D: to the pin pricks, to dye the subcutaneous layer.
N: He grunts in pain as the urine and rubber sting.
C: R
D: Daylight begins to appear at the barred window as he works, and we begin to see Cyrillic letters emerging in black on his skin - ‘C A W...’
C: U
D: Birds begin to sing the dawn chorus. Daylight illuminates the
C: AT
D: scene and we read the Russian name ‘C A W A’ tattooed on Zykov’s thigh. He uses the white sheet to wipe the excess of the mixture away. FE
E: SACHA
N: Zykov uses a polished metal needle tray as a mirror to check his work. When he is satisfied he lies back on the pillow and sighs. All his strength has gone and his life is dribbling away. S The freed catheter begins to dribble urine onto the floor. U Zykov looks to the barred window one last time and hears birds singing. He takes a breath then reaches for the emergency cord, which he pulls. Then his eyes close and the C catheter flow reduces to a drip, drip, drip. FO
S: 2 EXT. FOGGY RAIN-COVERED RUSSIAN GRAVEYARD - DAY 2 *
N: Deafening noise. A ROAD DRILL begins to dig up the frozen earth as if it were concrete. Grey daylight. A traditional, onion-domed Russian orthodox church sits in a snow covered graveyard on the outskirts of Moscow. In the distance high-rise tower blocks are shrouded in frozen fog. Gravestones protrude from a thick quilt of fog as the GRAVE * DIGGERS drill in the shadow of the church. Iron and steel ring out in the bitter cold. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 3.
S: 3 INT. SMALL HOME NEAR RUSSIAN GRAVEYARD, KITCHEN - DAY 3
N: We hear the road drill digging in the distance. Gorni Zykov, the old man we saw in jail, is lying dead and naked on a table. We study his lifeless body for a moment, lit by the grey * light. We revisit the tattoos and glimpse the name ‘SACHA’. Other tattoos tell the story of his life, in the style of the Vory v Zakone. He has a faded star above his heart. A crucifix is tied to his right wrist and rests in his frozen grip. Then a door opens and three priests carrying incense enter.
C: ES
D: The road drill wheezes, stops and starts outside. The priests stand around the body and then there is a knock at the door. The OLDEST PRIEST gestures toward the door.

N: (Come in.) GREGORY enters first, dressed in a sharp dark suit. Right * behind him his younger brother enters and we should see the * truth in his eyes. This is Vladimir. Their entrance swirls * S the incense smoke. Gregory is carrying a brand new black suitcase, which he places on the floor beside the body. U The oldest of the priests is running hot water from a tap at the sink into a plastic bowl a little way behind the body. C Steam clouds. He hands the bowl of hot water to Gregory then * begins to fill a second bowl. FO A second priest hands Gregory a white cloth. Gregory waits * for the second bowl of hot water to be handed to Vladimir. A * priest gestures for them to begin. Gregory soaks his cloth in the hot water and looks at his * brother. They begin to wash their father’s body. * The priests glance at each other. Vladimir looks down at the body, unsure. Quietly to Gregory,
C: VLADIMIR
D: Do they expect us to wash his dick? Because I’m not fucking touching my dad’s dick.
N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 4. The short priest reacts a little. Gregory speaks evenly to his brother without averting his eyes from the body.
C: GREGORY
D: Vova, the short one speaks English.
N: The short priest reacts a little. Vladimir shrugs. He begins to giggle - a bit freaked out. Gregory splashes his cloth on Zykov’s chest and steam rises. The Priests leave. Gregory continues to clean the body and Vladimir watches them exit. Gregory picks up the brand new black suitcase. He flicks it
C: ES
D: open. The open suitcase contains a brand new expensive suit of clothes with a pair of shiny shoes on the top.
N: Vladimir takes a breath and now the priests are gone his

C: AT GREGORY
D: It’s ok, Vova. * FE
E: CONT'D
N: Vladimir sits and puts his face in his hands. As he sobs silently, Gegory takes out the shoes then pulls out a crisp white shirt and lets it unfold. He takes a pin from the collar of the new shirt and puts it between his lips and interrupts... S

He spots a fresh * tattoo high up on his fathers hip bone. * The name ‘C A W A’ (SASHA) is written with a shaken * handwriting. * Gregory’s face expression immediately changes.

C: AT
D: We see three lines of bells in the pink and white belfry. There are four bells in each line and they grow in size from left to right. The first bell is as small as a hand, the last FE
N: bell is huge and decorated with iconic images. Between and through the open belfry we see the Russian skyline of endless snow huddled under a cloud of smoke. S The bells are attached to ropes and we follow them down into the darkness below. There is a chamber where a Priest stands. U He holds all twelve ropes, some in his hand and some are attached to his feet and legs. He looks like a puppet (this is how the Perebus funeral bells are rung). C He rings the first bell by tugging a rope with two fingers in FO a sharp jerk. As the first bell rings we see...
S: 5 EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY 5
N: A funeral procession consisting of three priests, two grave diggers, Gregory, Vladimir, and a stray dog which is yapping. The road drill is steaming in the snow. Zykov’s coffin is carried through the graveyard on the shoulders of the * mourners. His sons are at the front, followed by the two junior priests and finally the grave diggers at the back. The senior priest leads the way. Vladimir turns to Gregory and asks quietly, Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 6.
C: VLADIMIR
D: If he was born here, why has no one from the village come?
N: Gregory shrugs.
C: GREGORY
D: Stop talking. *
C: VLADIMIR
D: I’m just saying. Why would he * choose to be buried in a place where no one gives a shit about him?
C: ES GREGORY
D: His father is here somewhere. He was a war hero.
C: R VLADIMIR *
D: Still. I would have preferred he *
C: U
D: was buried in London. AT *
N: Vladimir looks around the graveyard. The priest overhears Gregory. He thinks for a moment then glances at a huge tomb and mausoleum half hidden by fog and a huge Russian pine * tree. It is the only big tomb in the graveyard. * FE
C: PRIEST
D: He was the son of General Nevsky Lavra? S
N: Gregory shrugs in response. U They arrive at the grave side. The awkward business of lowering the coffin begins, with the grave diggers using straps. The puppeteer priest is ringing the bells one-by-one C and the tone gets deeper each time. FO Vladimir is freezing and Gregory is impassive, he lights a cigarette. The priest hurries to the other priests and whispers to them. The coffin is lowered and reaches its resting place. The oldest priest comes to the brothers and bows a little.
C: SENIOR PRIEST
D: .
E: On behalf of the people of Savyalovsky, I would like to thank your grandfather for saving this entire region from the Nazis. He was a great hero
N: The priest kisses Gregory’s hand and then Vladimir’s. He straightens before saying, Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 7.
C: VLADIMIR
E: It’s in our blood.
N: We stay on the brothers’ grieving faces for a moment as the priest throws frozen soil onto the coffin. In the background beside the grave of the war hero, the grave digger spits into the ground. *
S: 6 INT. CAR, ROAD NEAR TRAIN STATION - DAY 6 *

N: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 9. Gregory turns and goes to get out of the car. It becomes * clear now that Vladimir feels vulnerable without the protection and counsel of his older brother.
C: VLADIMIR *
D: Can’t I come with you? We’ll just * do the wake when we both come back. * Fuck’em. *
N: Gregory has always run the family business and so far only delegated minor, non criminal, responsibilities to Vladimir. Returning to London alone makes Vladimir nervous... GREGORY *

S: 8 INT. RUSSIAN RESTAURANT - DAY 8
N: Forty people are gathered for the wake, families with children or men alone. A table has been set up for canapés * and waiters in starched uniforms serve the guests. The men wear black ties and the women wear sable. At first they look like members of the British establishment, but look closer and it should become apparent that the men in here are gangsters, Turkish, Russian and Serbian. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 10.
S: 9 INT. RUSSIAN RESTAURANT, SIDE ROOM - DAY 9
N: Vladimir is smartly dressed. Sober. He peers through a crack in the door from a private side room. He spots a huddle of Russian men sitting in a corner, deep in conversation, then sees three Turkish men in conversation at another table. One of the Russians breaks off and heads for the Turkish group with a piece of paper folded in his hands. He gives the piece of paper to the Turks and a discussion begins. Vladimir doesn’t like these machinations going on all around him and without Gregory. *
C: ES VLADIMIR *

D: I can tell the cousins Gregory is * coming back tomorrow, right? * People want to know for sure... *
N: Vladimir speaks to Leon without turning. *

C Ilkay dances, poses next to the painting. Laughing, playful. Striking poses that match the figure in the portrait. Pulling FO sad faces. Vladimir starts laughing, gets up and joins her. They dance. They kiss - hands all over each other. Vladimir breaks away to line up more coke. Ilkay looks round the room, dancing, curious. Looks in a drawer, doesn’t see anything, then another - nothing, one more and suddenly, what has she found? Very slowly she pulls out a gun. Gregory’s gun. She weighs it in her hand, admires it, tries it out. She turns points it at Vladimir. He looks up, freaks out. She laughs, cowers. Now he laughs, gets up and goes to take the gun off her. She dances with it teasing him, they play fight, wrestle, he tries to grab her. She runs, jumps on the sofa, he chases. It’s getting faster, she jumps, he tackles her - Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 27. BANG! - the gun fires. A heart beat or two. The music skips. Both bodies lie dead still. Slowly, Vladimir starts to get up, breathing hard. He struggles to climb from under Ilkay’s lifeless body. Blood begins to pool fast from under her chest and toward Vladimir’s feet. He steps back....and back...to avoid the flood. He drops the gun. He stares at the body.

S: 51 EXT. HOLYWELL CEMETRY, OXFORD - EARLY MORNING 51 *
N: The beautiful over grown Oxford cemetery is filled with and * C shadows on a sunny and foggy morning. The tombs sit at angles * or are half sunk into the ground. The yearly lushness makes * FO it the total opposite to the graveyard in Russia. Then we see a shadow and then see Luda walking between the graves, glancing at a map of famous grave stones. She checks the inscriptions and finally finds the tomb of someone called Theophilius Carter, who died in 1904. There is a tea pot on the grave. Luda looks around once and then takes a small envelope from under her coat. She places it in the teapot. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 39.
S: 52 EXT. OXFORD UNIVERSITY, WADHAM COLLEGE - DAY 52
N: A perfectly English scene as students about to sit exams walk around the manicured quadrant in flowing black robes. Through the crowd a tall, gaunt man with wild grey hair walks quickly and carelessly. We follow him...
S: 53 INT. WADHAM COLLEGE, MONTY’S OFFICE - DAY 53
N: ....in shafts of light we absorb the dry, sun bleached interior of books and leather and upright chairs. Books of art history are strewn on a circular coffee table. The door to the office opens and the gaunt man with grey hair enters.
C: ES
D: He sits instantly down at his desk and turns on his computer. He checks his incoming mails. *

S: 57 EXT. REMOTE SURREY CROSSROADS/INT. MINI - DAY 57
N: FE A deserted country lane in the middle of the Surrey countryside. A black Mini is driving fast down the lane with Monty at the wheel. Monty drives the way he runs. We hear Serbian pop music. S U He is smoking. He seems to be nervous. He drives fast across a windswept crossroads but suddenly his Sat Nav speaks... C
C: SAT NAV
D: FO
N: You have reached your destination... Monty hits the brakes hard and skids to a halt. He turns off the music and the wind moans. He looks all around at the empty desolation. Not even a barn to mark the spot. Monty checks a scrap of paper on which he has written some GPS coordinates. From the glove compartment of his car, Monty takes out a house brick. We see Monty getting out of the car with the envelope in one hand and the brick in the other. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 41. He walks forward a few paces then carefully places the envelope down under the brick on the white line in the middle of the road (we infer he is following an instruction). He glances around for someone or something, but the hedges and * fields seem empty. He walks back to his car and gets inside. He fires his engine and slowly reverses away from where the envelope has been left. Monty drives away. The envelope is under the brick and the wind tugs at it. After only a moment a battered Land Rover appears from a dirt
C: ES
D: track in the nearby field. It parks directly over the envelope, with a front wheel either side.
N: We hear a rhythmic clicking coming from inside the Land
C: R
D: Rover. Then the passenger door opens and a red setter dog is shooed out of the vehicle. The dog comes around to the envelope and begins to sniff it. Satisfied, the dog sits.
C: U
D: Then, a Mongolian Russian gets out of the car. This is HUNAN.
C: AT
D: The rhythmic clicking sound gets louder and we see that Hunan has a Geiger counter in his hand. He comes to the front of the Land Rover and squats down. FE
N: He runs the Geiger counter over the envelope and it stays even. Satisfied that it is ok, Hunan pulls on a surgical glove then picks up the envelope and straightens. He carries the envelope to the car and then drives away fast. S U
S: 58 EXT. HUGE GEORGIAN COUNTRY HOUSE, SURREY - DAY 58
N: C We take in the majesty of the house for a moment then see Hunan’s Land Rover approaching the front gate. The property FO is surrounded by a high wall topped with razor wire. There is an Iris recognition security monitor at the gate which Hunan pulls towards with his window open. He peers into the purple light for a moment and the security gate begins to open.
S: 59 EXT. HUGE GEORGIAN COUNTRY HOUSE, FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY 59
N: As Hunan drives up the long drive, we see security cameras following his progress. Two heavy looking ex-FSB security men guard the door with guns hidden. Hunan pulls up in front of the door and gets out of the Land Rover with the envelope. We might notice a sentry on guard on the roof of the nearby building. Hunan trots past the security guards who evidently know him well and defer to him. He punches a security code into a keypad beside the front door.
S: 60 INT. HUGE GEORGIAN COUNTRY HOUSE, CORRIDOR - DAY 60
N: Hunan walks smartly down a long corridor with doorways opening out either side onto drawing rooms and dining rooms. Oil paintings decorate the walls along with tapestries. As we follow Hunan and the envelope, we see secretaries at work in some of the rooms, large log fires burning, video screens flickering.
C: ES
D: Several staff members walk in the opposite direction and greet Hunan silently. He reaches a door marked ‘Observatory’. There is another keypad beside this door and Hunan punches in a coded number.

D: Hunan enters this most secure area. All around the walls we see works of art, some old masters and some Impressionists. We will learn that some of them are stolen. There are also pieces of text in Cyrillic, framed and protected by glass. FE
N: In a shaded wall we see a collection of six original Russian icons from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Hunan walks past them and trots up the staircase. S
S: 62 INT. HUGE GEORGIAN COUNTRY HOUSE, OBSERVATORY - DAY 62
N: U At the top of the spiral stairs he finds a closed door which he opens. Inside we are surprised to find a fabulously C expensive and technically advanced TELESCOPE. FO The upper room has been turned into an observatory with a glass domed roof. The telescope is pointed at the sky. The room is empty though a cigarette still burns in an ashtray. He looks at another closed door with a sign which reads ‘Library’. Hunan glances at the smouldering cigarette and guesses. Hunan turns and places the envelope beneath the telescope. He walks. Once again we stay with the envelope for a moment. We hear Hunan’s footsteps as he descends and hear a door close. Only then does Natasha Dubinsky emerge. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 43. She is a little older than the woman in the photo Gregory saw, and thinner. She may not have slept and we might imagine she spent the night gazing at the stars. We sense someone alive furiously inside her own head. She opens a drawer and takes out some white gloves, of the kind used for handling very old manuscripts. She then opens up the envelope and stares at the photograph of the icon. The sight of it seems to put a new light into her eyes and bring her life to the surface. She places the photo down on the desk and smooths it, speaks in Russian,

N: A young Chinese guy with dyed blond hair (TONY) stands at the door of the small office. His Mother (MADAM LAU) is pouring tea for three. Madam Lau is in her sixties and is wearing a gold and blue silk tunic. She has deep, hard eyes. S Gregory and Vladimir are seated at a round table as their tea cups are poured. A living waterfall picture glows in the half U darkness. Once Madam Lau has poured her tea she takes a seat and begins to speak in Hak Ga dialect. C After she has spoken, Tony translates in a bored monotone. FO

N: Gregory and Tashkar are staring only at each other, communicating silently. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 68. Tashkar’s eyes burn as he finally turns to Vladimir. Vladimir sees the murder in his eyes and looks to Gregory imploringly...

The moment he enters Gregory shoots the clown twice in the face. Vladimir is close and Gregory pushes him down the cellar steps. Vladimir falls hard down the stone steps into darkness. When Tashkar enters he sees the substitute clown lying dead, his face blown apart by the two bullets. Gregory has his arm over his face in grief. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 70. Tashkar growls and points the gun again at the dead clown’s face and pumps more bullets into his head (making him more unrecognisable). * After a moment the smoke clears.
