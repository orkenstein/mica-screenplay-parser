S: INT. CHANGING SALON - NIGHT
N: Tulle. Satin. A pin in the hair, a bauble in the ear. Bubbles of champagne and perhaps even the smoking remnants of a joint in a nearby dish by a Victorian setee. Camera REVEALS two fresh-faced young women in front of a long mirror. ROSE MARIE HATHAWAY, 18, and VASILISSA DRAGOMIR (LISSA), 18, formally dressed and elegant. Could be a Jane Austen movie except no empire waists, and...
C: ROSE
D: I look like a fucking macaroon.
N: She downs her champagne. Lissa, used to Rose saying it like it is, plops a sparkling tiara on Rose’s head.
C: LISSA
D: And now you look like a princess.
C: ROSE
D: If I were a princess, the champagne wouldn’t be empty.
E: holding up her glass
C: LISSA
D: Allow me, Your Highness.
N: She fills their glasses, laughing as the bubbles spill over. Rose sips the champagne before it overflows her glass, the tiara slipping as she bends over. She pulls it off --
C: ROSE
D: How do you even wear this thing? I just lost a hundred strands.
N: -- and places it on the head of its rightful owner.
C: LISSA
D: Heavy is the head, thin is the hair.
N: Now they’re back at the mirror for last looks. Two lovely young women, best friends at the prime of their lives.
C: LISSA
D: Rose, if anyone looks like a macaroon, it’s me. You look beautiful.
E: CONT'D
N: Rose smiles her thanks. Playing dress-up isn’t her thing, but she knows she looks good. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 2.
C: ROSE
D: We look beautiful, Lissa. Head to toe.
N: Rose lifts the skirts of her party dress to reveal a well- worn pair of shit-kicker boots.
C: ROSE
D: Let’s party.
E: CONT'D
N: Lissa grins and raises her glass. As they CLINK --
S: EXT. ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT
N: The FLASH of a PHOTOGRAPHER’S BULB as dozens of decked out partygoers move up the carpet-lined stone staircase that leads to an enormous CASTLE, lit up for a gala. Jewels and gowns and bespoke tuxedos abound as the arrivals are projected onto a wall that lines the street -- this kingdom’s version of E! Red Carpet Arrivals. A parade of LIMOUSINES crawls towards the entrance.
S: EXT. CASTLE GATES - NIGHT
N: A massive gate marks the entrance of St. Vladimir’s Royal Court. The seat of the MOROI VAMPIRE KINGDOM. The castle glitters high in the distance as the taillights of limos head up the hillside. INSIDE the gates, in position, are FIVE DHAMPIR GUARDIANS. The night is quiet. Perhaps too quiet. One of the Guardians squints. Is something out there? REVERSE to show nothing but wooded fields and a long lonely road. We’re in the middle of nowhere.
S: INT./EXT. LIMO - NIGHT
N: At the castle, a window lowers to reveal VICTOR DASHKOV, 50s. Handsome and sophisticated. A GUARDIAN peers in.
C: VICTOR
D: Victor Dashkov.
N: Victor’s eyes FLASH GOLD -- the Royal calling card for entry.
C: VICTOR
D: My daughters. Sonya Karp. Mia Karp.
E: CONT'D
N: Inside, SONYA, 23, quiet, careful, and decidedly odd, flashes her eyes. However hers flash SILVER. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 3.
C: GUARDIAN
D: One Royal Moroi, one non. And the third?
N: MIA, 18, sits back in her seat. Refusing to play.
C: VICTOR
D: Mia...
C: MIA
D: The Guardians make us suffer through this every time.
C: VICTOR
D: It’s security protocol.
C: MIA
D: It’s humiliating.
C: SONYA
D: Only if you care about such things.
E: don’t make a scene
C: MIA
D: How can they not know who I am?
C: VICTOR
D: Mia, darling. Be a sport.
N: Annoyed, Mia flashes her eyes at the Guardian. Silver.
C: GUARDIAN
D: Non-Royal.
E: ticking the box
C: MIA
D: Not for long.
E: sharp
N: They disembark from the car heading for the red carpet as we DRONE UP to see the castle in all its glory.
S: INT. BALLROOM - PALACE - NIGHT
N: ECU ON a silver swizzle stick with a razor sharp tip as it pricks a finger. As the blood pools on the tip -- WIDEN to reveal a SEXY BARTENDER, who allows the DROP OF BLOOD to fall in like a maraschino cherry. Rose grabs it and a blood-free glass with one hand. In her other are two more flutes. As she moves through the majestic ballroom in search of Lissa, we see the party through her eyes, a classy but sexy mash up of Royal fantasy and Studio 54. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 4. A stunningly dressed WOMAN magically makes her fingertips emit a shower of sparks, the embers lighting up the air. **Note: Every Moroi vampire, whether Royal or not, is able to perform basic Elemental Magic. Nothing too strong -- the equivalent of a parlor trick. We will call them Fire Users, Water Users, Earth Users, Air Users.** A WATER USER in a LIME GREEN METALLIC SUIT and hair to match waves his hand over a martini glass, causing the gin to swirl and part until the olive is free to be plucked out. A bevy of Young Royals gather around an elaborate water pipe; a Fire User using magic to heat it, as a Water User spins the vapor into various shapes before being inhaled. Through partially closed velvet curtains, we catch a glimpse of two ROYAL MOROI PARTYGOERS exposing their FANGS and sinking their teeth into the neck of a rapturous HUMAN. As the human lets his head fall back in ecstasy... Rose passes a line of Guardians, holding her foot out like a handshake to MIKHAIL, 20s, who slyly taps her boot with his similar one as a hello. The humorless ALBERTA, 30s, scolds:
C: ALBERTA
D: Rose. Behave.
C: ROSE
D: Always, Alberta.
E: never
N: As Rose continues on, linger with Alberta and Mikhail.
C: ALBERTA
D: Don’t encourage her.
C: MIKHAIL
D: She’s the guest of a Moroi Princess. Let her have some fun.
C: ALBERTA
D: Guardians are not here to have fun.
C: MIKHAIL
D: She’s a Novice. Cut her some slack.
C: ALBERTA
D: The last thing Rose Hathaway needs.
N: Mikhail spots Sonya entering. His eyes light up, but one look from Alberta keeps him firmly in his place. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 5. Mia falls in beside Sonya as her eyes scan the party. Victor already pressing flesh in the background. As Sonya clocks a ROYAL IN FULL MARIE ANTOINETTE drag, including a bird cage holding a live finch in her wig --
C: MIA
D: I don’t see Andre --
C: SONYA
D: A BIRD IS NOT A TOY. Perhaps you should activate your stalker beacon.
E: voice raised then
C: MIA
D: It’s not stalking if one’s engaged.
E: embarrassed by Sonya
C: SONYA
D: Promised --
E: correcting her
C: MIA
D: Promised to be engaged. Don’t be jelly, Sonya. It doesn’t suit you. Although, not much does.
E: then
N: She wanders off, leaving Sonya unfazed and unaware of Mikhail’s eyes on her from afar. A Queen’s FOOTMAN passes her rolling an enormous CAKE past portraits of the QUEEN from her teenage years spanning decades -- and clusters of Royals in heated political debate. Beneath the frothy facade lay deep divisions. Finally the Footman approaches the Queen herself, ancient but stately, as she receives the DRAGOMIR FAMILY: Lissa, her charismatic brother ANDRE and their PARENTS.
C: THE QUEEN’S ANCIENT HERALD
D: The Dragomirs, Your Majesty.
N: The Queen waves him away from her ear, annoyed.
C: QUEEN
D: Clarence would introduce his mother to his father. How are my delightful Dragomirs?
C: LISSA’S DAD
D: Pleased to be celebrating your 200th birthday, Your Majesty.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 6. Andre bows to her, all charm.
C: ANDRE
D: Happy Birthday, Fair Lady. You don’t look a day over eighty.
C: QUEEN
D: Andre, my dear, you’re a cheeky rascal. And a lovely liar.
N: Having finally spotted him, Mia steps in next to Andre, sliding her hand through his arm as she curtsies --
C: MIA
D: Happy Birthday from me as well, Your Majesty.
N: The Queen’s eyes glide over hers to find Lissa behind her.
C: QUEEN
D: Ah, Princess Vasilissa, the angel to your brother Andre’s devil.
C: LISSA
D: He is shameless, Your Majesty. How shall he be punished?
E: teasing
C: QUEEN
D: Being King of the Commonwealth will be punishment enough.
N: Andre’s eyes catch a beautiful woman’s across the room. This is TATIANA, 25. All lips and legs and brains. Noticing --
C: QUEEN
D: Though surely he’ll find something to cheer him once he’s king.
E: CONT'D
C: VICTOR
D: Now Your Majesty, you know there will have to be an actual election.
E: approaching
N: Victor places a hand on Mia’s shoulder. Centering her.
C: QUEEN
D: Pfft, a formality. Who would deny me my pick for successor?
N: As the Dragomir’s greet Victor warmly, and the adults chatter about politics, Mia’s sharp gaze lands on -- VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 7. Tatiana eye-fucking Andre from afar. After giving him a subtle head tilt, Tatiana turns away, passing -- Rose, who finally spots Lissa making a beeline for her.
C: LISSA
D: Bubbles, perfect.
N: She takes two glasses from Rose just as she’s BUMPED by a CARELESS PARTYGOER. One glass slips, but Rose’s free hand shoots out with supernatural speed, catching it mid-air.
C: LISSA
D: Nice.
E: CONT'D
N: Calling after the sloppy party-goer --
C: ROSE
D: Excuse you!
N: The Partygoer shoots some sparks into the air with his finger spelling “sorry, Rose.” As the girls laugh MARIE CONTA, middle-aged Royal, stares at Rose, sniping to another ROYAL.
C: MARIE
D: What are the Dragomir’s thinking letting Lissa invite that girl everywhere she goes? A Guardian’s place is at the gates.
S: EXT. GATES - NIGHT
N: POV from the woods towards the gates. Perhaps something IS out there. Watching. Waiting. CLOSE on a GUARDIAN as his head SNAPS to attention. What did he just hear? He motions to his PARTNERS. Two of them fall into flank position immediately, withdrawing SILVER STAKES from their weapon belts. As the gates start to open --
S: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
N: WHOOSH! Music plays as A ROYAL MOROI waves their hand over the enormous cake and its 200 candles ignite in FIRE. Rose and Lissa gently push through the crowd to get a better view as the Queen steps up to her cake, aided by Victor. Mia lingers behind her father, looking around for Andre.
C: ROSE
D: Looks like Mia lost her prince.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 8.
C: LISSA
D: I’m amazed she let him out of her sight long enough to lose him. Where is Andre?
E: speaking of
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. COAT CHECK - NIGHT
N: Andre has Tatiana pressed up against the wall, hidden by hanging coats as they fuck in the coat check. The sound of voices singing Happy Birthday (Moroi-style) startles him.
C: ANDRE
D: Shit. I have to go --
N: He tries to pull away, but she tightens her grip until they both finish. Then, both catching their breaths --
C: TATIANA
D: Never leave a girl undone, Andre. Not even for the Queen.
N: As he pulls himself together --
C: ANDRE
D: Lovely to meet you...?
C: TATIANA
D: Tatiana.
N: He grins, then dashes out, disappearing around the bend of a long hallway just as we CUT TO:
S: EXT. GATES - NIGHT
N: Three Guardians move across the road as a unit. Movement in the grasses lining the road grabs one Guardian’s attention -- -- as a black BIRD takes flight from the brush, its wings flapping in the startled Guardian’s face. He relaxes, sheaths his stake. He turns to the others, when -- WHAM! Something HITS him hard, tackling him. We hear SNARLS.
C: GUARDIAN
D: STRIGOI!
S: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
N: Andre hurries up to a prime spot near the Queen just as the birthday song finishes. He throws Rose and Lissa a wink. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 9. The old Queen struggles to blow out the candles. Giving up, she closes her eyes. An unseen WIND begins to blow, building until every last candle has gone out. Over hearty applause --
C: QUEEN
D: I may be older than iron, but I can still work my way around Elemental Magic.
C: CROWD MEMBER
D: Air Users Forever!
N: That starts the rest of the crowd shouting, Earth Users, Fire Users, Water Users. As the chanting takes on a rancorous edge, Andre looks to the Queen for permission to address the crowd. At her nod, he steps forward.
C: ANDRE
D: Yes. Air Users Forever — and don’t forget Water Users Forever — And what about Earth Users and Fire Users?
E: Water Users cheer
N: More cheers. Near the Queen, HIGH PRIESTESS IRENA, 50s, clever and political, pipes up:
C: HIGH PRIESTESS IRENA
D: Ever the politician, Andre. Can’t you choose one?
N: The crowd titters nervously. These two don’t see eye to eye. Then, Andre, effortlessly charming, and entirely sincere --
C: ANDRE
D: Irena, how can I choose my right hand over my left? My heart over my brain? Alone, they’re weak. Together they’re strong. A strong state cares for all its citizens.
C: MARIE CONTA
D: Define citizens?
E: pointed
N: Andre looks at Lissa and Rose, both watching him, rapt.
C: ANDRE
D: Those we walk through life with, shoulder to shoulder. Those we love, no matter our differences. Those we fight for. And those who fight for us.
E: to Rose
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 10. Though Marie and Irena don’t look happy, Victor and the Queen exchange a proud look.
C: ANDRE
D: To me, that sounds like everyone in this room. The Royal Moroi who value our heritage. The Non-Royal Moroi who keep our society going. And... the Dhampir Guardians, of whom we expect so much.
E: CONT'D
N: Surprised murmurs from the Moroi. As the Guardians try to cover their shock at being honored, Andre makes his point --
C: ANDRE
D: We share the same history. We fight the same enemy. And the Strigoi don’t care if we’re Royal or Non- Royal Moroi, or if we’re half Moroi, half human like the Dhampir Guardians. They want us all dead. Like these two hands, and like this head and this heart, imagine what we could achieve if we faced the future as one kingdom, united.
E: CONT'D to the now hushed crowd
N: A silent beat -- followed by thunderous applause. Lissa and Rose beam, as Tatiana watches, a sly smile on her lips. Then:
C: QUEEN
D: What a scene stealer you are. And what happened to the music? I thought this was a party!
E: teasing Andre
N: The crowd cheers, MUSIC RISES. Hundreds of rose petals fall as the party kicks in to high gear and as Lissa pulls Rose to the dance floor, not a care in the world, INTERCUT:
S: EXT. GATES - NIGHT
N: The Guardians are fighting something ferocious, silhouetted by the bright perimeter lights. Whatever it is, it’s strong and unrelenting. One Guardian takes a hit -- More chaos, and snarls outside the gates. Punches thrown, teeth bared, blood and spittle flying. Another Guardian gets LAUNCHED from the scrum, flying twenty feet back. INSIDE - Alberta gets an alert on her earpiece. A tilt of the head sends Mikhail and two Guardians out. Moving quickly but stealthily so as not to grab attention. As the party goes on… VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 11. OUTSIDE - Mikhail and the two Guardians arrive at the gates to find a Guardian dogpile atop their unidentified assailant. HISSES and SCREECHES from below as they try to restrain it. One of the Guardians raises his stake, but a GNARLY HAND whips out from the scrum and grabs the Guardian’s wrist, BREAKING IT with a snap. As the Guardian falls back, Mikhail is there, driving his stake into the center of the scrum. A hideous SHRIEK and then, finally, blissful silence. INSIDE - Mikhail and the Guardians calmly return to the party, none of the privileged Royals aware of any danger. That’s how it works. The Guardians protect the Moroi vampires from random Strigoi vampire attacks. It’s the way it has always been (but not the way it will always be). As camera lingers on the spirited Rose and Lissa dancing without a care in the world... CUT TO:
S: EXT. LONG COUNTRY ROAD/INT. SUV - NIGHT
N: A LIMO flies down the road. Inside, Lissa and Rose are ribbing Andre as the parents try to keep the peace.
C: LISSA
D: Darlingest, Delightfulest Andre, future king of all the land...
C: ROSE
D: Oh to be the Chosen One...
C: ANDRE
D: Go ahead. Laugh it up.
C: LISSA’S DAD
D: Careful or when he’s king he’ll have you thrown in the dungeons.
C: ANDRE
D: When I’m king I’ll be getting rid of the dungeons. Change is coming.
C: LISSA’S DAD
D: Winning the crowd is one thing. The only ones who matter are the heads of the twelve families. Win them over, and you’ll be able to make real change as king.
N: Rose calls up to the Guardian in the front seat. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 12.
C: ROSE
D: Sebastian, you’re going to be the King’s Guardian --
N: SEBASTIAN, 30, strong, steady, turns around.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Not with the way you’re climbing in the rankings.
C: ROSE
D: I’ve already got a job lined up when school is done, thank you.
N: She leans into Lissa, a BFF nudge.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Only Rose Hathaway would pass up the top Guardian spot in the world.
C: ROSE
D: Who wants to guard a king when I can protect my best friend?
C: ANDRE
D: That’s Rose settled. At least one of you has a plan.
C: LISSA
D: Oh, I have a plan. Finish school, and then ask the new king, who I happen to have an in with, for a dispensation so Rose and I can see the world. The outside world. And every museum in it.
C: ANDRE
D: And who’s going to take care of our aging parents?
E: teasing
C: LISSA’S MOM
D: Not funny, Andre.
C: LISSA
D: I’m going if I have to forge the dispensation myself.
C: ANDRE
D: I don’t know, Liss. They’re not getting any younger. What we want and what we must do can be very different things.
E: in a fake kingly voice
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 13. Lissa hits his arm, all in good fun.
C: ANDRE
D: Hey --
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly THE CAR SHIFTS like a SONIC BOOM has hit. Everyone is ROCKED from their seats in SLOW-MOTION. Shock and horror as we RAMP SPEED INTO REAL-TIME -- The limo FLIPS on the road, as though something catapulted it into the air. Sparks and screams and fire. CUT TO:
S: EXT. LONG COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
N: An empty road. An orange light in the far distance. The light gets closer and closer, until we realize it’s the burning fireball of a limousine skidding upside down along the road. It FLIES STRAIGHT TOWARDS CAMERA and we -- SMASH TO TITLES.
S: EXT. CEMETERY - DAWN
N: Atop an ancient parapet with a view to the sea, a RAGGED WARRIOR ANGEL CARVED FROM STONE stands sentinel over a cloistered cemetery. Below we find THREE NAMES FRESHLY ETCHED IN ONYX. ERIC DRAGOMIR. RHEA DRAGOMIR. ANDRE DRAGOMIR. Lissa lays three calla lilies to honor her family. Behind her, family friend and tacit uncle, Victor Dashkov, waits. The weight of her grief shows through as he shepherds her toward the entrance and a waiting limo --
S: EXT. ST. VLADIMIR’S ACADEMY - DUSK
N: Perched on a turret, Rose watches as that same limo travels the hillside up from the gates. Tucking something in her jacket, she checks no one’s watching -- then PARKOURS TO A LOWER TURRET, THEN ANOTHER, all speed, grace, and supernatural athleticism.
S: EXT. ST. VLADIMIR’S ACADEMY - DUSK
N: The car pulls to a stop in front of the entrance to St. Vladimir’s Academy, sprawling grounds lit by bright lights. Rose lands unseen nearby. As a door opens, she rushes up --
C: ROSE
D: Lissa...
N: -- and suddenly finds herself FLAT ON HER BACK, a muscled arm pinning her down. Her eyes lock on her assailant’s. Intense, focused, belonging to a very handsome face. She stares at him, wind knocked out of her in more ways than one. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 14. This is DIMITRI, 25, no-nonsense and stoic. At least on the outside. Inside are wells of emotion always kept in check. Victor emerges from the car, opening an umbrella to block the setting sun.
C: VICTOR
D: It’s all right. Rose won’t harm Lissa.
C: DIMITRI
D: She has something. Show me.
E: to Rose
N: Rose pulls a small carved wooden unicorn from her jacket. Flustered and a little pissed.
C: ROSE
D: It’s a super-dangerous welcome home gift.
N: Still holding her, Dimitri looks to the gift, then to Rose -- a tiny chemical beat passing between them, before --
C: LISSA
D: I love it.
E: O.C.
N: Rose turns her head to see Lissa, standing underneath her own parasol. She smiles --
C: LISSA
D: I mean, I’m not twelve... but...
E: CONT'D
C: ROSE
D: Shut up. It’s fucking adorable.
E: beaming
N: Rose scrambles to her feet. The girls barrel into each other. They hug, laugh, swing each other around. As they settle, Rose takes Lissa’s face in her hands. Asks with her eyes, you okay? Lissa’s eyes glint with tears: No, but I’m trying. Dimitri watches the girls, observing the powerful intimacy of their friendship. Rose gives Lissa a final nod, like a promise to always be there, then takes charge.
C: ROSE
D: Nice to see you, Victor. I’m taking Lissa back to the dorm.
E: CONT'D
N: Dimitri starts to follow, but Victor holds him back -- VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 15.
C: VICTOR
D: They’re within the wards. They’ll be fine.
N: As Rose escorts Lissa away --
C: ROSE
D: Who is that guy?
C: LISSA
D: That is Dimitri... My new Guardian.
E: don’t kill the messenger
N: As Rose looks back, her stare boring a hole through his skull, their eyes locking again from afar...
C: ROSE
D: But I’m your Guardian.
E: PRELAP
S: EXT. ST. VLADIMIR’S CAMPUS - NIGHT
N: Rose and Lissa cross the brightly lit campus drawing glances, hellos, and furtive whispers from students in posh uniforms. But all Rose can focus on is --
C: ROSE
D: Or I will be when I graduate.
C: LISSA
D: Shouldn’t you be heading to class?
C: ROSE
D: They kept us apart for three months. Class can wait. And don’t deflect. We don’t need that guy. I’ve got your back. Always.
C: LISSA
D: I guess they want someone with field experience now that I’m the Head of the Dragomir Family. Whatever that means. Family of one.
N: This is heartbreaking, but Rose knows how to handle it.
C: ROSE
D: No. Don’t get sad yet. I have a whole thing planned involving a lot of booze and sloppy drunk tears. We’re not gonna let Dimitri ruin it or our plans for the future.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 16.
C: LISSA
D: Sloppy drunk sounds good. After a nap... He is good looking, though.
E: alright then also
C: ROSE
D: I didn’t notice.
E: stubborn
N: As they move towards the building that contains the dorms...
C: DIMITRI
D: Will Rose Hathaway be a problem?
E: PRELAP
S: INT. ALBERTA’S OFFICE - GUARDIAN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
N: Dimitri is with Victor and Alberta.
C: ALBERTA
D: Rose is always a problem. She’s one of our best Novices, but she’s a handful.
C: VICTOR
D: The girls have been friends their whole lives. We’ve spoiled them, let them break all the rules, even let them be roommates in the Royal Dorms. Is it any surprise Rose has certain expectations?
C: ALBERTA
D: A Guardian’s duty is to do as they’re told.
C: VICTOR
D: That may be, but this is a big change for both of them. As the new Head of Family, Lissa is an important Royal. With her parents and brother gone, she’ll need Rose more than ever. For her sake, you’ll have to navigate that relationship carefully. The last thing Lissa needs is more stress.
C: DIMITRI
D: With all due respect, I’m not a nanny. My job is protection.
C: VICTOR
D: A word that can take many forms.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 17. As Dimitri takes this in...
S: INT. GIRLS’ DORM ROOM - NIGHT
N: Finally “home” in their room, as Lissa adds Rose’s gift to a bevvy of carved unicorns on her dresser. Referring to each:
C: LISSA
D: From when I broke my collarbone, when I broke up with Antonia Diaz, my first hangover. And now...
C: ROSE
D: ...Should we burn this?
E: holding up a black dress
C: LISSA
D: Please. I never want to wear black again.
C: ROSE
D: I wish I’d been with you.
C: LISSA
D: I tried. Victor said your place was at school, in training. That Royal mourning was for family only.
N: Rose winces. Weren’t they her family too?
C: ROSE
D: Victor, who isn’t a blood relation either?
C: LISSA
D: He was my parent’s best friend; and as my godfather, he’s the boss. But not for long.
E: then, a smile
C: ROSE
D: Not for long. First, graduation. Then, every piece of art for you -- and pizza for me -- in Europe --
E: grinning
C: LISSA
D: -- and then the world.
N: Rose finds a pouch jammed with prescription medicines.
C: ROSE
D: Um... Not sure these will pass through human customs...
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 18.
C: LISSA
D: ...Unlike you, I didn’t make it out of the accident totally unscathed.
N: At the mention of the accident, Rose grows quiet. Then --
C: ROSE
D: No wonder it was so hard to get you on the phone.
E: re the pills
C: LISSA
D: ...I hated taking them... The only thing worse was not taking them.
C: ROSE
D: Oh, Liss.
C: LISSA
D: They said I was all bruised up and my arm was broken. But I couldn’t feel my body. All I could feel was my insides shaking. Like I was trapped inside with all this feeling and nowhere to go to get away from it. So they started giving me drugs. But there isn’t a pill in the world strong enough to make it better.
E: then
C: ROSE
D: I wish I could.
E: soft
C: LISSA
D: I know. Just being with you helps.
C: ROSE
D: Good. Though maybe my plan will involve less booze than expected.
E: considering the meds
C: LISSA
D: It’s okay. I’m tapering off. And I don’t wanna blow my surprise party.
C: ROSE
D: What surprise party?
C: LISSA
D: Thanks, Rose.
E: a knowing smile MORE
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 19.
C: LISSA
D: All I want is for things to go back to normal. You lying badly is a nice first step.
E: CONT'D
N: Rose grabs sunglasses and a hat. Holding them out to Lissa.
C: ROSE
D: Do me a favor later? Bring these. And act surprised?
N: PRELAP: Marie Conta: “The accident that took Andre and his family has wounded us all, Your Majesty...”
S: INT. QUEEN’S PRIVY CHAMBER - NIGHT
N: Marie Conta addresses the Queen.
C: MARIE CONTA
D: ...and though I loathe to speak ill of the dead --
C: QUEEN
D: You will anyway?
C: MARIE CONTA
D: I hope Andre’s policies will be buried with him. We need strong leadership now. I assume you’ll name your successor soon? I have some thoughts --
N: The Queen perks up as Victor arrives at the door.
C: QUEEN
D: And I have a date with an old friend. You’re excused, Marie.
N: Irritated at being brushed aside --
C: MARIE CONTA
D: Yes, Your Majesty.
N: She exits as Victor enters.
C: QUEEN
D: You see what I’m up against? Sniveling children. Instead of mourning the man who could unite them, these idiots are all scrambling for the crown. All of them for personal gain. Not a compassionate soul among them...
E: feeling her years
C: I adored Andre.
E: MORE
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 20.
C: QUEEN
D: He was no saint, which I suppose made me like him all the more... Losing him now...
E: CONT'D
C: VICTOR
D: With no one to bridge the divide...
C: QUEEN
D: Enough. There’s work to be done. You must prepare Lissa for her role as Head of the Dragomir Family.
E: shaking it off
C: VICTOR
D: It won’t be easy for her. You know she was planning to apply for a Royal Dispensation so she could study art at a human university.
C: QUEEN
D: Those dreams are done. Lissa will finish her schooling and take her place within the Royal Court.
C: VICTOR
D: And Rose?
C: QUEEN
D: When she completes her training, we’ll find her a placement in one of the other provinces.
C: VICTOR
D: She won’t like that.
C: QUEEN
D: Moroi come first. Rose knows that. She’ll do her duty.
S: EXT. ST. VLADIMIR’S ACADEMY - PRIVATE GARDEN - DAWN
N: Rose leads Lissa towards a GAZEBO tucked away behind manicured shrubbery. Lissa’s parasol gets snagged on a tree. Sunlight hits her face.
C: LISSA
D: Ow.
N: She steps back under the umbrella.
C: ROSE
D: Easy. You can’t wear third degree burns to your surprise party.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 21. As they round the bend -- SURPRISE! Lissa feigns surprise as she surveys the Moroi in their sunglasses and stylish clothes taking shade under the gazebo. Meanwhile, Novices bask in the sunlight they get so little of living by the Moroi schedule - - one in which school and social time are at night, while sleep and illicit activities happen during the day. MASON, a fun hunky Novice, who everyone knows has a huge thing for Rose, approaches with drinks.
C: MASON
D: Lissa -- Rose isn’t the only one who missed you.
C: ROSE
D: Mason helped me plan this.
C: LISSA
D: Meaning Rose told you what she wanted and you did all the work?
C: ROSE
D: No fair. I helped.
C: MASON
D: Whatever you say, Rose.
N: Lissa spots Mia all in black. Seeing --
C: ROSE
D: Mia’s really working it.
C: LISSA
D: I feel sorry for her.
C: MASON
D: I don’t. She just wants attention.
C: ROSE
D: And we didn’t throw you a party to talk about Mia. Drink up.
N: JUMP CUT: Party hijinks, St. Vlad’s style. Novices show off physical skills, diving through WATER RINGS that hang in the air, courtesy of Moroi Water Users. At a makeshift bar, MEREDITH, 18, a matter-of-fact Novice, whips up cocktails, her nerd-brain excited by the various combinations. Rose dirty dances with Mason. On a nearby lounge, JESSE, Royal Moroi, 18, makes out with a ROYAL GIRL, while two ROYAL BOYS make out with each other. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 22. Tipsy now, Lissa’s surrounded by friends, enjoying herself. REVERSING we see Mia watching her as she orders a drink.
C: MIA
D: Vodka tonic.
C: MEREDITH
D: Wouldn’t you like something more --
C: MIA
D: Extra lime.
E: a cold glance
C: MEREDITH
D: Last thing you need is more acid.
N: Meredith mixes as Mia frowns. What’s that supposed to mean?
C: MEREDITH
D: Aren’t you hot in all that?
E: CONT'D
C: MIA
D: I’m in mourning.
C: MEREDITH
D: Right. Andre. Your...almost fiancé.
C: MIA
D: Excuse me, we were very close.
C: MEREDITH
D: Sorry for your loss.
E: hands her a drink
C: MIA
D: This isn’t what I ordered.
N: Meredith levels her with a look.
C: MEREDITH
D: Maybe not. But it’s what you want.
N: Yep, that’s chemistry between them. It unsettles Mia.
C: MIA
D: What do you know about what I want? How dare you talk to me like that. What’s in this?
E: ...takes a sip
C: MEREDITH
D: Basil. It’s complex and fragrant.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 23.
C: MIA
D: Well, it’s a ridiculous thing to put in a drink...
C: MEREDITH
D: You want another?
C: MIA
D: Yes.
N: Rose and Lissa approach the bar, seeing too late that Mia is there. Rose turns to walk away to avoid her, but Lissa is kind and a little bit drunk. Steps forward.
C: LISSA
D: How are you, Mia?
C: MIA
D: I’m grieving, Lissa. With dignity.
E: pointed
N: Rose hears this and spins back, but Lissa can handle herself.
C: LISSA
D: Rose... Have a drink. And one for me -- Meredith?
C: MIA
D: I wouldn’t if I were you. I hear you have a big day tomorrow.
C: LISSA
D: I’ve taken more than one exam with a hangover. I think I can manage an early morning at the Royal Court with your dad.
C: MIA
D: Head of a Family isn’t something you can fake your way through. Looks like no more dancing through life and being best friends with Guardians...
C: ROSE
D: Looks like more Royal advice from Non-Royal Mia...
N: Still, they know she’s right. The old days of being together doing whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted it, are in jeopardy. As the girls consider their fate -- CUT TO BLACK. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 24.
S: EXT. ST. VLADIMIR'S ACADEMY - DUSK
N: It’s magic hour on the quiet campus. Whereas humans would be settling down for dinner, vampires are rising for breakfast. Lights come on one by one, illuminating the falling shadows.
S: INT. CHURCH ARCHIVES – NIGHT (DAY 2)
N: Seated at a desk in a candlelit vaulted room of brick and stone, a fuzzy headed Lissa tries to focus as Sonya sets an ANCIENT PARCHMENT in front of her. As she stares at the indecipherable script (WRITTEN IN “OLD MOROI”), to Victor --
C: LISSA
D: It might help if we flicked on an actual light.
C: SONYA
D: That would damage the paper.
C: LISSA
D: Oh. Of course. Not sure it would help anyway...
E: looking down at it
C: VICTOR
D: You only need to recite this small passage.
C: LISSA
D: Recite...?
C: VICTOR
D: For the consecration. Tradition dictates when there’s a new Head of the Family they be blessed in the presence of all the others.
C: LISSA
D: Recite Old Moroi in front of people? Today?
C: VICTOR
D: I need to see the High Priestess. You’ll be fine.
N: Victor leaves. Sonya follows, then looks back at Lissa, curious. When Lissa looks up, Sonya smiles.
C: SONYA
D: That’s a beautiful yellow you’re wearing.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 25. Lissa looks down at her black and white school uniform.
C: LISSA
D: Okaaay. See ya, Sonya.
N: Lissa looks at the paper, tries to sound it out. Rising, she paces, mumbles, squints at the odd writing. Then, suddenly -- ALL THE CANDLES FLICKER OUT. Lissa looks around, creeped out... After a beat -- THEY FLICKER BACK ON... Lissa freezes. Then -- A WARM FLAME OF LIGHT APPEARS OVER HER PARCHMENT making it far easier to see. Suspecting a prank --
C: LISSA
D: All right. Who’s there?
E: CONT'D
C: MALE VOICE
D: Thought you could use some light.
N: Emerging from an alcove is CHRISTIAN OZERA. Smoldering, brilliant, wounded, and a new student at St. Vlad's. The two hold their gaze for a beat, an instant chemistry between them. But there’s something more, something they can’t pinpoint. Realizing she’s staring, Lissa raises her chin --
C: LISSA
D: And you are?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: New.
N: She waits for more. Then, wondering if this next admission will drive her away -- he almost dares her with it --
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I’m Christian Ozera.
E: CONT'D
C: LISSA
D: ...Oh...
N: Armoring up, he adds with snark --
C: CHRISTIAN
D: And just to get it out of the way: No, I don’t know why my parents decided to turn Strigoi. And since they’re dead I can’t ask them.
N: Not sure how to take this, Lissa bites back -- VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 26.
C: LISSA
D: So you, what, just hang around church archives waiting for girls to... need a light?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Or I might have some questions about where you go after you die.
N: And click. That’s it. The connection - loss. Both orphans.
C: LISSA
D: ...I’m sorry about your parents.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I’m sorry about yours.
E: armor coming down
N: A beat as they look at the only other person with any idea of how they feel. Then, a bit desperate --
C: LISSA
D: So, you actually read this stuff?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I’ve gotten better at it. It’s really... kind of... beautiful.
C: LISSA
D: I don’t suppose you have any idea what this third line means?
N: He comes closer to see the parchment.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: It’s a vow of protection. The head of each family takes an oath to fight against demons.
C: LISSA
D: Wonderful...
E: fuck
N: Moving closer, he reaches for it. Reads in English —
C: CHRISTIAN
D: With my body and my life I swear to defend against all demons living and dead, and any who would stray from what is right. Say it with me.
E: then
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 27. Both holding it now, their hands touching, they read off the paper together in the Old Moroi language, intensely aware of each other as they do. He turns to her; they’re so close.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Where’s the rest of it?
E: CONT'D
C: LISSA
D: ...There’s more?
E: breath catching
N: Then -- footsteps. Lissa turns to see Victor arriving.
C: VICTOR
D: Ready?
C: LISSA
D: ...I wouldn’t be, except...
N: She turns back to Christian but he’s gone. Off Victor’s look:
C: LISSA
D: ...Except, I didn’t want to disappoint you.
E: CONT'D
N: As she follows him out --
S: INT. PALACE CATHEDRAL – NIGHT
N: SACRED MOROI MUSIC fills the cathedral as a PROCESSION OF TWELVE ROYAL MOROI dressed in matching ceremonial robes move toward the altar. Among them, and the youngest by far, is Lissa, feeling very small. The cathedral is full of Royal spectators -- including students in head to toe St. Vladimir’s Royal uniforms. As Victor watches with the Queen, Christian enters, receiving dirty looks, especially from Marie. Ignoring them, he takes a spot on an aisle. As he lands, THREE ROYAL MOROI in the aisle move to another. There is no doubt, Christian is an outcast. As the processional reaches the altar, it splits, leaving Lissa alone. High Priestess Irena nods. Lissa, nervous, recites her oath in Old Moroi.
C: LISSA
D: With my body and my life I swear to defend against... against all...
N: She looks out and spots a judgmental Marie Conta. Then -- Christian in the back. Oddly comforted, she continues — VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 28.
C: LISSA
D: Against all demons living and dead, and any who would stray from what is right.
E: CONT'D
N: The Queen watches as Lissa and Christian share a smile. Watching as Lissa’s warmth melts Christian’s armor.
S: EXT. ST. VLADIMIR'S ACADEMY - TRAINING FIELD - NIGHT
N: Rose exits the dorms. Stops when she sees Dimitri standing outside, eyes straight ahead in Guardian-mode. Confused --
C: ROSE
D: You know we have magic wards around the gates to keep us safe. Lissa doesn’t need a 24/7 detail.
C: DIMITRI
D: Lissa’s still at the church. Royals only.
E: without looking her way
C: ROSE
D: So you’re just...having a staring contest with the air?
C: DIMITRI
D: You’ve studied perimeter control.
C: ROSE
D: Yes. Got an A.
C: DIMITRI
D: What’s around this perimeter? Don’t look, just tell me.
C: ROSE
D: Street clear, gates secured, rooftop empty, turrets contained.
C: DIMITRI
D: How do you know?
C: ROSE
D: I’ve trained for years to know every inch of this place.
C: DIMITRI
D: Exactly. You’re able to operate on instinct because you are intimately familiar with your surroundings. But I’m new here. A lot to learn in a little time.
E: MORE
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 29.
C: DIMITRI
D: So I suppose you can say I’m having a staring contest with the street, the gates, the rooftops and the turrets.
E: CONT'D
N: He still hasn’t looked her way. She studies him. Then grins.
C: ROSE
D: You’re kind of a Guardian nerd, aren’t you?
N: At this, he nearly cracks a smile. She starts walking away. Toying with him a little.
C: ROSE
D: It’s cool. Respect. Do your thing, Perimeter-man. But just know, I plan on getting your job when I graduate.
E: CONT'D
C: DIMITRI
D: I agree. Lissa would be in perfectly good hands with the best Guardian at St. Vladimir’s Academy.
C: ROSE
D: Thank you.
C: DIMITRI
D: Although that may be hard, given your ranking.
C: ROSE
D: I’m number one. I’m always number one.
C: DIMITRI
D: Then perhaps you’re not as good at Perimeter Control as you think.
N: Rose looks at him, confused. His gaze shifts to something behind her. She turns, following his gaze to see -- The LEADERBOARD above the training field. Rose Hathaway is listed in FIFTH PLACE. Mason in first.
C: ROSE
D: What the fuck --
S: EXT. TRAINING FIELD - NIGHT
N: Rose chases Alberta who leads warm-up drills through rows of Guardian Novices working in perfect precision. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 30.
C: ROSE
D: How am I fifth?
C: ALBERTA
D: You missed class yesterday. Automatic ten demerits. It’s very tight in the top five.
C: ROSE
D: I missed class to welcome Lissa back to school.
C: ALBERTA
D: Find me a Strigoi who will accept that excuse and we’ll talk.
N: A nod of her head tells Rose to fall in line with the group. Frustrated, Rose does. Mason throws her a sexy grin.
C: MASON
D: Game on, Hathaway.
C: ROSE
D: Don’t get comfortable, Mace.
N: Rose goes through the warm-ups. Her body is fierce and fluid, but her mind is racing. Across the yard, she spots Dimitri back in position. She doesn’t notice, but his eyes flick to watch her for just a moment. She has made an impression.
S: INT. GIRLS' DORM ROOM - DUSK
N: Back to bedtime. The girls prepare for bed, a lot on their minds. Lissa notices Rose is uncharacteristically silent.
C: LISSA
D: Wanna do Worst Day Ever?
C: ROSE
D: Oh my god, yes. Me first.
N: Lissa sits on the floor, legs crossed. Rose lies down, her head in Lissa’s lap. She stares up at her, unleashing --
C: ROSE
D: First, Alberta’s on some mission to bring me down, and I’ve had Mia’s stupid voice in my head all day, and Dimitri’s a dick. And now that he’s assigned to you, I’m afraid they’ll never let me be your Guardian out in the world after graduation. Anyway, I pretty much hate everyone. Except you... What?
E: CONT'D
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 31.
C: LISSA
D: Your well-intentioned outrage is my favorite thing about you.
E: smiling
C: ROSE
D: Good, because I’m pretty sure you’re stuck with it forever.
C: LISSA
D: Okay. A. Don’t worry about Dimitri. And B. Do not listen to Mia. We know who we are. And where we’re going. Pretty soon our biggest problem will be finding Feeders for me and Italian food for you.
C: ROSE
D: Preferably in Italy... And how was your day?
C: LISSA
D: Well, I had to speak Ancient Moroi in front of a hundred Royals.
C: ROSE
D: Oof.
C: LISSA
D: And Victor said from now on I have to be up, dressed and pretty by 7pm. Oh, and I’m not allowed to drink anymore.
C: ROSE
D: Jesus. You win. Switch.
N: They switch positions and now Lissa’s head is in Rose’s lap.
C: ROSE
D: Maybe that’s not the worst thing, though, with all those meds you’re taking.
E: CONT'D
C: LISSA
D: No. I’m totally off those now. No one wants a pill-popping princess.
E: off Rose’s surprise
C: ROSE
D: They can’t put a timeline on grief.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 32.
C: LISSA
D: It’s fine. I’m tired of living in a fog.
N: Rose looks down at her. Gently --
C: ROSE
D: What do you see now that the fog is lifting?
C: LISSA
D: ...I miss them.
N: Rose nods. They sit in silence feeling the weight of this. Lissa closes her eyes, letting her exhaustion wash over her. Rose sits silently while her friend falls asleep.
S: EXT. ACADEMY/EXT. VICTOR’S HOUSE – DAY
N: The campus is deserted as Moroi ready for bed. Except for Sonya, who is surrounded by several birds, seeming happier amongst animals than humans. As she hums and feeds them, one flies off toward Victor’s house where —
S: INT. MIA’S BEDROOM – DAY
N: VICTOR enters to find Mia in her PJ’s looking out a window.
C: VICTOR
D: Anything interesting out there?
C: MIA
D: Just Sonya, the bird lady.
C: VICTOR
D: Be gentle on your sister.
C: MIA
D: I am. Sometimes. But really...
N: He glances at a JEWELED NECKLACE on Mia’s vanity.
C: VICTOR
D: You need to give that to Lissa.
C: MIA
D: I do not. And anyway, I’m wearing it to the reception tomorrow.
C: VICTOR
D: ...I’m sorry, Mia. It’s Royals only. The Queen was very insistent.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 33.
C: MIA
D: So that’s it? One minute I’m the future king’s fiancée and the next I’m invisible? I’m keeping the necklace.
C: VICTOR
D: It’s a Dragomir family heirloom.
C: MIA
D: And a Dragomir gave it to me.
C: VICTOR
D: With Andre dead, you can’t keep it.
E: gently
C: MIA
D: I was so close. I know everyone thinks it was just an arranged marriage, that you wheedled a favor from the Queen. But she adored Andre. She only allowed it because he asked her. He thought I was smart. He may not have loved me; I didn’t love him. That way. But we were good together... I would have made a great queen.
C: VICTOR
D: There’s a lot you can do without ever sitting on a throne.
C: MIA
D: You’re Royal. You don’t get it. The only way to wield power is to have power. Thanks to being adopted, Sonya and I live with the trappings of royalty, but the restrictions of not being Royal.
C: VICTOR
D: Having the ear of the Queen can be just as powerful...and the Queen has big plans for Lissa.
N: Mia turns back to the window.
C: MIA
D: Lissa is a twit... And what is up with Sonya and those fucking birds?
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 34.
S: EXT. VICTOR’S HOUSE - GROUNDS - DAY
N: We go back to Sonya as she watches a bird soar overhead. Suddenly it’s joined by another...then another. The sky shifts, the world becoming stylized. The day darkens. More birds gather into a murmuration of starlings, and now instead of Sonya down below, we find Rose staring up at the sky in fascination. The mood is gothic, ethereal (if it feels like a dream sequence, that’s because it is). The birds move and shift, flying lower to the ground. Rose is startled by this. They take the shape of a MAN. The Bird Man starts moving towards Rose. As it gets closer, the birds disperse, revealing an ACTUAL man in their place. It’s ANDRE. Bloody. Skin torn, teeth smashed. Horrifically injured.
C: ROSE
D: Andre.
E: terrified whisper
S: INT. GIRLS' DORM ROOM - DAY
N: Rose BOLTS up in her bed, covered in sweat, breathing heavily. She looks around to get her bearings, seeing -- Lissa is in bed, thrashing around in the midst of a terrible night terror. Rose scrambles over to Lissa’s bed, shaking Lissa awake. Lissa looks at her, wild-eyed, but then --
C: LISSA
D: Rose.
C: ROSE
D: Shhhh. You’re having a bad dream.
N: Lissa nods, her eyes drooping again. As she drifts off --
C: LISSA
D: All those birds...
N: Rose’s head snaps in her direction. Did she and Lissa just have the same dream? CUT TO BLACK.
S: INT. ROYAL FEEDING CHAMBER – NIGHT
N: CLOSE ON THE FACE OF A HUMAN WOMAN, eyes wide as a pair of fangs search her neck. She begins to pant. Is that fear? No, it’s desire. She grips her right hand with her left to keep from pulling whoever’s attached to those fangs in. Finally the fangs pop the surface of her skin and sink slowly in. A gasp of pleasure escapes her lips. REVEAL Jesse seated behind her, feeding from her neck. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 35. He’s among a row of RECLINERS in a spa-like setting, where a dozen ATTRACTIVE HUMANS, all high from the bite, lie in various states of repose as Royals enjoy their ‘breakfast.’ Lissa enters. Looking for the COORDINATOR, she sees him watching Jesse, who’s going to town on his Feeder’s neck. As the Feeder’s eyes roll back into her head from blood loss --
C: COORDINATOR
D: Mr. Zeklos. This is your second warning. We have rules. This is a human Feeder, to be respected.
N: The picture of smug Royal privilege, Jesse wipes his mouth --
C: JESSE
D: And you’re a Non-Royal nobody. So piss off.
C: LISSA
D: Leave him alone, Jesse.
N: Covering his annoyance, Jesse takes his leave. As he goes, the Coordinator waves Lissa toward one of the Feeders. An older woman, ALICE, 50s, with a perma-stoner grin.
C: LISSA
D: Hey, Alice. Haven’t seen you in a while.
E: CONT'D
C: ALICE
D: I’ve been working in the Non-Royal feeding chamber. I think I aged out. But one of the skinny hot Feeders fainted and here I am.
C: LISSA
D: How are you? What does Carly have to say about life out in the human side of things?
C: ALICE
D: Well, according to my daughter, it’s a cesspool of poverty, racism, and don’t even get her started on carbon emissions. Which is why your neck of the woods is so much more appealing to an old lady like me. No pun intended.
N: As they chat, Lissa sits behind her, getting comfortable. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 36.
C: LISSA
D: It’s only a matter of time before Rose and I finally get to see it for ourselves.
C: ALICE
D: Don’t know why you’d bother. Except Shake Shack. You vamps eat, right?
C: LISSA
D: Sometimes. You ready?
N: Alice nods. Lissa arches her neck and delicate FANGS appear. As she gently bites into Alice, who falls into bliss --
C: ALICE
D: Oh that’s nice...
N: ANGLE ON THE DOOR, where Mia enters (still in black). Her eyes scan the room, finding Lissa. She heads over. Lissa releases Alice’s neck and raises her head to find the Dragomir necklace dangling from Mia’s outstretched hand.
C: MIA
D: I guess this is yours now.
C: LISSA
D: Thank you.
N: Able to see how much this bothers Mia --
C: LISSA
D: I like your dress. It’s really nice for you to mourn him this way.
E: CONT'D
C: MIA
D: Thank you.
C: LISSA
D: You have such an eye for fashion. Any idea what I should be wearing to the reception tonight?
C: MIA
D: I wouldn’t know. I’m not invited.
C: LISSA
D: Oh, I’m sorry -- I didn’t realize --
N: At that, the Coordinator approaches Mia.
C: COORDINATOR
D: This is a Royal Feeding Chamber.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 37.
C: MIA
D: Do you see me feeding?
E: snappish
C: LISSA
D: She’s with me.
C: COORDINATOR
D: I’m afraid it doesn’t matter, Princess. That’s the rule.
N: Mia darkens. She hates this. Lissa feels terrible.
C: LISSA
D: Well, then we’ll both go.
N: As they exit, Mia steals a look at Lissa, remembering her father’s words about power.
C: MIA
D: Definitely floor length. It says cocktail attire but Marie Conta and all the girls from that family notoriously overdress to make everyone else look like garbage.
N: They head through the door... MUSIC UP:
S: EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS – NIGHT
N: CLOSE ON THE LEADERBOARD. Rose’s fifth place ranking mocking her from above. She heads for the field stopping when she sees Dimitri standing with Alberta. He gives her a polite nod. She nods back somewhat less politely then makes a beeline for Mason. Alberta to Dimitri --
C: ALBERTA
D: It’s Friday. Challenge Day. The only day of the week it’s possible to lift your score.
E: an eye on Rose
N: Rose approaches Mason. Slaps a CHALLENGE CARD into his chest.
C: MASON
D: C’mon, already? I’ve only gotten to be number one for like a day.
C: ROSE
D: I’m more comfortable on top.
C: MASON
D: Don’t I know it.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 38. A look flashes between them that doubles down on their subtext. There’s some history there. CUT TO: Mikhail whistles the start of the Challenge Match. Rose and Mason start to spar. They dip and move like elegant boxers, no one throwing the first punch. Mason grins at her.
C: MASON
D: C’mon. Make it hurt --
E: CONT'D
N: BAM. Rose lands a brutal punch -- and they’re all in.
S: INT. GIRLS' DORM ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mia helps Lissa get ready. Piles and piles of dresses cover both beds. Mia is good at this. She pulls pieces together, using them unconventionally to build a stunning outfit. As she places the Dragomir necklace around Lissa’s neck...
S: EXT. TRAINING FIELD – NIGHT
N: Challenge Night continues, as Rose and Mason spar, the other Novices split in their allegiance, cheering on from the side. The fighting is a blend of primal hand-to-hand contact with elements of Martial Arts. Guardians punch harder, run faster and jump higher than ordinary humans. From the sidelines, Dimitri watches Rose in action. His face doesn’t react, but inside he’s impressed. At the BUZZER, Rose and Mason stop, panting. Finally, Alberta raises a WHITE CARD. Mason lets out a whoop.
C: ROSE
D: A fucking draw?
C: ALBERTA
D: Round two: weapons.
N: Rose smirks. Game on. This is her sweet spot. As she grabs a special training vest, putting it on...
S: EXT. GIRLS’ DORM ROOM – NIGHT
N: From the window we see Lissa exit her dorm, dressed to the nines for her next event. REVERSE to reveal that Christian is watching her head off into the night like Cinderella. As he gets an idea, CUT TO: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 39.
S: INT. PALACE - NIGHT
N: Mid-conversation with a FUSSY ROYAL at the Queen’s private cocktail party, Lissa eyes champagne floating by on a tray...
C: LISSA
D: I had no idea there was so much to know about tea...
C: FUSSY ROYAL
D: I’ve made quite a study of it. King Abdullah never drank anything but in his era. Except a little rosewater now and again.
N: AT THE ENTRANCE, Christian approaches in a bespoke suit, looking very Royal. Recognizing him, the DOORMAN hesitates --
C: DOORMAN
D: I’m not sure you should be here.
N: Christian’s eyes flash GOLD (a mark of a true Royal):
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I’m still an Ozera and my bloodline still has a vote. You can’t keep me out.
N: No choice, the Doorman lets him in. Ignoring the disapproving glances, Christian peers around. Finally, he sees Lissa. As though sensing she turns and sees Christian, their gaze holding until someone cuts across the room, breaking it. They circle through the crowd toward each other. Finally meeting, neither quite knows what to say... Nearby Victor spots them. Not happy, he excuses himself from his conversation. As he makes his way over –
S: EXT. TRAINING FIELD – NIGHT
N: Rose and Mason finish suiting up with vests that register if your stake has reached your opponent’s heart.
C: DIMITRI
D: I’m impressed so far. Rose is half Mason’s size but she’s using it as an advantage.
C: ALBERTA
D: Yes, she’s quite good. But she’s impossible to control.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 40.
C: DIMITRI
D: Everyone’s a little unpredictable at her age.
C: ALBERTA
D: Trust me, she’ll do something to fuck it up. Rose, Mason. Time. First to three hits wins.
E: hitting the timer
T: INTERCUT WITH LISSA’S EVENT
N: ...Where, aware of all the disapproving stares --
C: LISSA
D: I’m surprised to see you here.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: It’s been a while since I’ve been to one of these.
C: LISSA
D: Being here must be hard for you.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: It isn’t for you?
C: LISSA
D: It used to be easier. Now I’m biding my time until I graduate and get out of here.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Aren’t we all.
C: LISSA
D: So why are you here?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I just came to see if you needed an Old Moroi tutor. Your heart’s in it but your pronunciation is terrible.
E: with a grin
N: Lissa laughs, feeling her face flush as Victor reaches them.
C: VICTOR
D: The Queen is looking for you.
N: With a curt nod to Christian, as Victor leads Lissa away — AT THE FIELD deep into the fight, Rose struggles to reach Mason’s heart. Then DING. Mason has hit hers. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 41. Frustrated, Rose eyes Mason as they spar. DING. He hit it again. But this time Rose clocked how. DING. She gets a hit in. As they continue — AT THE EVENT, as Lissa looks back to Christian --
C: VICTOR
D: Christian Ozera is a non-starter. His parents chose to turn Strigoi. That is a mortal sin. The last thing you need is the church against you.
E: CONT'D
C: LISSA
D: Why does anyone care who I like? Can’t I be left alone to live my life the way I want to?
N: Victor laughs ruefully, then gently:
C: VICTOR
D: Oh, Lissa. That is the opposite of what your life will be. We need to discuss your schedule. With so many families in town for St. Vladimir’s Day, and your installation as the leader of the Dragomir’s, there will be several privy Council meetings. Attendance is mandatory. Also...
E: switching gears
N: As Victor carries on, Lissa sees Christian, who, aware of disapproving eyes on him, quietly slips away.
C: VICTOR
D: ...The other Heads of Families will be inviting you to a series of less formal events, also mandatory. Starting tomorrow --
E: CONT'D
C: LISSA
D: No.
N: Victor looks up. Lissa’s face flushes, anxiety creeping in.
C: LISSA
D: I don’t want this. I’m not Andre. I don’t want any of this.
E: CONT'D
C: VICTOR
D: What we want and what we must do are often miles apart.
E: compassionate but firm
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 42. Lissa’s breath catches as she -- FLASHES BACK TO THE NIGHT OF THE ACCIDENT, seeing Andre -- only this time as he speaks --
C: ANDRE
D: What we want and what we must do can be very different things...
N: -- THE CAR SHIFTS like a SONIC BOOM has hit, his dialogue bottoming out as we see him in SLOW-MOTION be sprayed with flying glass. As blood begins pouring down his face -- -- BACK TO Lissa as she starts to hyperventilate. AT THE FIELD, Rose goes in for Mason’s heart –- -- As Lissa’s panic rises, her vision starts to blur. Dizzy now, as she reaches out to keep herself from falling -- -- Rose, about to successfully complete the move – falters. Lissa starts to sink into a faint, Victor props her up as -- Rose’s knees give, almost as though she is fainting too. DING. Mason gets the hit. Alberta gives Dimitri a ‘told you so’ look. As Rose wonders what the fuck just happened, she
T: faints and we...CUT TO BLACK.
S: INT. GIRLS’ DORM ROOM – DAY
N: Rose enters, slinging her gym bag down, losing her hoodie --
C: ROSE
D: Sorry to wake you. I was in the infirmary. This really weird thing happened where --
N: Rose looks at Lissa’s bed. Sees the covers are mussed, but
T: Lissa is gone. CUT TO:
S: INT. DORM ROOFTOP - DAY
N: Lissa stands in the sun staring at the sky. She’s still, even peaceful as an angry rash starts to rise on her skin. Then --
C: ROSE
D: Lissa... What are you doing?
N: Lissa turns to Rose. Tears standing in her eyes -- VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 43.
C: LISSA
D: I don’t know why I’m here. Andre was the special one. He should have lived, not me.
C: ROSE
D: Oh, Liss. That’s not true. It’s just the grief talking. You’ve been through so much.
C: LISSA
D: But it’s all a blur. I feel like they were here, we were all here, together. And then there was an accident I can’t even remember -- and then they were gone... and I...
N: Rose pulls Lissa into a protective hug. As she cries it out:
C: ROSE I know... I know.
D: ...You really don’t remember anything about that night?
E: after a beat
C: LISSA
D: No. It’s all one big brain fog that won’t clear.
C: ROSE
D: Mine’s more like a complete blank.
N: Is that weird? Time will tell. As Lissa settles --
C: ROSE
D: There you go. Just blow your nose. Oh, okay. On my shirt’s fine.
E: CONT'D
N: Then, suddenly knowing what Lissa needs, what they both need -
C: ROSE
D: But Lissa? If we’re gonna sunbathe, I know where I want to be.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. LAKE – DAY
N: Rose pedals a well-worn bike with Lissa on the seat behind her under her parasol, both girls giddy with freedom. As they arrive at the edge of a lake on the outskirts of campus, past the gates, Lissa lights up. Rose smiles -- VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 44.
C: ROSE
D: This is the first place your family took me.
C: LISSA
D: I remember. Right after I met you. Standing all alone on Family Day.
C: ROSE
D: You ran straight up to me. Your clothes were so clean I was afraid your parents wouldn’t let you play with me.
C: LISSA
D: They loved you.
C: ROSE
D: I didn’t know what a family was until then.
N: As that lands on Lissa --
C: LISSA
D: You keep asking if I’m going to be okay. Are you?
C: ROSE
D: They were... everything a family should be. You said Andre should be here - I feel like Sebastian should be too. He was a great Guardian to Andre. But he died too. They were all so strong... But somehow we’re the survivors.
C: LISSA
D: I guess that can be our band name.
E: beat, trying to deflect
C: ROSE
D: Well, it’s time we have our own memorial. Our own chance to say goodbye.
N: She reaches into the backpack she has with her, and as she pulls out TWO COLORFUL SKY LANTERNS we CUT TO:
S: EXT. ACADEMY ROOFTOP – DAY
N: Dimitri steals private time to do his physical and meditative training on the roof under the sun as the campus sleeps. His body is a temple, reflected in his flow. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 45. He looks out at the campus for a moment, a part of him always on duty. Then, as he carries on with this regimen --
S: EXT. LAKE – DAY
N: Under the shade of the tree, Lissa and Rose hold hands. In their free hand they each hold a lantern. Then Lissa, simply:
C: LISSA
D: Mom, Dad, Andre. We love you. And we’ll never stop missing you. Be at peace.
N: They release the lanterns. After a beat...
C: LISSA
D: Remember the first time we came here? ...And I beat you to the pier.
E: CONT'D a grin starting
C: ROSE
D: Did not. That’s crazy.
C: LISSA
D: I totally did. And I still can.
C: ROSE
D: You’ve never once beaten me to the -
N: But Lissa BOLTS. Diving in the water she races to the Pier.
C: ROSE
D: CHEATER --!
E: CONT'D
N: As Rose dives in after her.
S: EXT. ACADEMY ROOFTOP – DAY?
N: Something catches Dimitri's peripheral vision. He looks up. And sees two lanterns floating in the sky. And something tells him to head to —
S: INT. GIRLS’ DORM ROOM – DAY
N: Dimitri knocks. No answer. He nods to DORM MATRON OKSANA, who opens the door. She looks in, then opens the door wide so he can see. The room is empty. The girls aren’t in their beds.
S: EXT. LAKE – DAY
N: The girls lie under a shaded tree, Lissa’s parasol giving her extra protection from the sun. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 46.
C: LISSA
D: Thank you for that. I feel better than I’ve felt in a while.
C: ROSE
D: You’re lucky you didn’t burn your face off, but yeah, I know. I can kind of feel it coming off of you. Is that weird?
C: LISSA
D: Not really. You’ve always been pretty tuned in to me.
C: ROSE Yeah, I guess.
D: Though, since you got back, I’m feeling all this stuff, but it seems...more like your feelings. Like, last night I got this flash of panic and I knew you needed me.
E: broaching carefully
C: LISSA
D: I was panicking. I did need you.
C: ROSE
D: That’s weird. Right?
C: LISSA
D: Very.
N: As they think about this --
C: LISSA
D: Earlier, when you found me on the roof. How did you know I was there?
E: CONT'D
C: ROSE
D: I don’t know. I just... did.
N: They look at each other, understanding that this isn’t normal. But then a bird FLIES overhead and Rose checks the sky, mindful of the time. The sun is getting low.
C: ROSE
D: We should head back. It’s one thing to be outside the wards in the sun, but if we get caught out here during Strigoi hours, we’re fucked.
E: CONT'D
C: LISSA
D: Fine. But I’m driving.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 47.
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK
N: Lissa’s pedaling with Rose on the back, pumping hard.
C: ROSE
D: You’re stronger than you look.
C: LISSA
D: Just because I’m not a Guardian --
E: looking back
N: The bike hits a rock, tossing both girls to the ground.
C: LISSA
D: Ow -- shit.
E: CONT'D
C: ROSE
D: Are you okay?
C: LISSA
D: Something’s bruised. Maybe my ego --
N: Rose checks Lissa’s knee, which is torn up from the fall.
C: ROSE
D: Can you walk?
C: LISSA
D: Yeah. Sorry, Rose.
N: Rose helps her to the bike. And sees the wheel is bent. Shit. She checks the sky again. Sunset is nigh.
C: ROSE
D: Forget about walking. We need to run.
N: Rose grabs Lissa’s hand, pulling her along as she races
T: towards the Academy. CUT TO:
S: INT. VICTOR’S HOUSE – DAY
N: Victor, his voice panicked, into his phone --
C: VICTOR
D: You need to find her. Immediately.
S: EXT. ACADEMY GATES – PRE-DUSK
N: On the other end of the call, Dimitri nods to the Gatekeeper to open the gate. Before he takes off in a full SPRINT --
C: DIMITRI
D: I’ll call as soon as I do.
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 48.
S: EXT. WOODS – NIGHT
N: Rose and Lissa race back through the woods. In the growing night, every snapping branch underfoot feels frightening. They approach a back GATE, split by a STONE WALL. Rose is about to climb the wall, when suddenly she stops, sensing something. A wave of unease, bordering on nausea.
C: LISSA
D: What’s wrong?
C: ROSE
D: I don’t know. I feel sick —
N: Then -- something DROPS INTO FRAME behind Lissa. It’s shadowed and snarling. Rose immediately LUNGES for Lissa -- grabbing her, using Lissa’s weight to her benefit (like earlier with Mason) and HURLS her upwards. As Lissa lands on the wall, their Pursuer follows -- hitting the top of the wall and INCINERATING in a shocking electric FLASH.
C: LISSA
D: Rose...
C: ROSE
D: The wards worked. It’s dead.
N: Lissa stares at the smoking dead Strigoi just inches from her. Ew. She looks down in the nick of time to see --
C: LISSA
D: ROSE --
N: Another Strigoi is BARRELLING towards Rose. Rose turns just a beat too late and the Strigoi SLAMS into her, getting her up against the wall. The Strigoi and Rose are nose-to-nose and for the first time we get a look at it -- Blazing red eyes. Long jagged fangs. Veins protruding. A feral energy. The face of nightmares. Rose struggles against it, searching for a weakness to exploit, but there is no escape from its grip. UP ABOVE, Lissa looks for some way, any way to help. Rose’s Strigoi EXTENDS ITS JAW to go in for the kill. Lissa SCREAMS, when -- CRACK. The Strigoi FALLS, revealing -- Dimitri standing behind it. A bloody stake in his hand. Rose and Dimitri stare at each other. Both breathing heavily, both terrified by what just happened. Rose can see it in his eyes. She’s in trouble. Big trouble. So she deflects -- VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 49.
C: ROSE
D: Don’t suppose there’s any way you could keep this just between us?
N: Just then -- KLIEG LIGHTS everywhere. Busted. CUT TO BLACK.
S: INT. GIRLS’ DORM ROOM - NIGHT
N: Victor paces before an exhausted Lissa.
C: VICTOR
D: That kind of risk was unacceptable at any time. Now, the future of the Dragomir Family is in your hands.
C: LISSA
D: A tiny family with no Andre, in a society with antiquated rules. What does it even matter?
C: VICTOR
D: If you think the rules are antiquated now, wait until you see what happens if any of the vipers jockeying for the crown get their way. Andre’s rule meant change for us. If the crown falls to the wrong bloodline, any progress your brother hoped to achieve -- will be impossible. The Dragomir vote is key to preventing that.
C: LISSA
D: Fine. You can tell me how to vote.
C: VICTOR
D: I could. And you could carry on without a care in the world as the empty vessel of leadership everyone expects you to be. Is that how your parents raised you?
N: A long beat as she lets his words sink in.
C: LISSA
D: No. But they raised Andre to be more. I’ll stay until the succession is assured. Then I’ll graduate. And get on with my life. Will that do?
E: then
N: After a beat, Victor nods, resigned. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 50.
C: LISSA
D: And please tell them not to be mad at Rose.
E: CONT'D
N: Almost laughing at her naivete --
C: VICTOR
D: Oh, Princess. We’re well beyond that.
S: EXT. ST. VLADIMIR’S - NIGHT
N: Rose exits the administrative wing to find Dimitri standing outside in his ‘spot.’ His eyes meet hers. Steely.
C: ROSE
D: No need. I just got an earful and then some from Alberta.
N: He doesn’t break her gaze. She stares at him, almost challenging him. Then --
C: ROSE
D: You saved me. Thank you. I should’ve told you I was taking Lissa outside of the wards. And I should have built in more time on our return for exigencies like the bike getting damaged. But I got her back in one piece. I made sure she was protected. They come first.
E: CONT'D off his silence
N: Dimitri finally speaks. Low and even, but hard.
C: DIMITRI
D: Protecting Lissa is my job. My only role here is to ensure that nothing happens to her. What you did was reckless and impulsive. Yes, you’re strong, but you’re a liability. And tonight you almost got the person you say you care about most in the world killed. There isn’t a rank low enough on that board for you right now.
E: eyes boring into hers
N: Rose can’t respond. She knows he’s right. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 51.
S: INT. GUARDIAN BARRACKS – LOUNGE - NIGHT
N: Mason and other Novices finish breakfast in the lounge of their barracks. More utilitarian than the Moroi dorms, furthering the class distinction between the two. Rose enters with her duffle bag. As Mason watches, Rose heads for one of the rooms, where -
S: INT. GUARDIAN BARRACKS – WOMEN’S SLEEP ROOM - NIGHT
N: A row of beds and desks. Meredith looks up from making her bed as Rose enters.
C: MEREDITH
D: Guess you’re slumming it with the rest of us now.
N: As Rose wordlessly drops her bag onto an empty bed --
S: INT. LISSA AND MIA’S DORM ROOM – NIGHT
N: Lissa enters her new room and drops the bag she’s carrying.
C: MIA
D: I thought we’d be sisters, not roommates.
E: O.S.
N: Lissa turns to find Mia, dressed in Saturday casual, who adds to the woman on tap to be the next queen:
C: MIA
D: You can have the window side if you like.
E: CONT'D
N: Lissa forces a smile. Then looks out the window and sees Christian walking, alone. Aimless. He looks sad. She opens her hand, looking down at Rose’s unicorn tucked in her palm.
S: INT. GUARDIAN REC ROOM – NIGHT
N: Rose is checking email on a computer, staring at the words – “let me and yourself down. As a Guardian I was shocked at your behavior. As your mother, I’m ashamed...” Then --
C: MASON
D: Rose?
N: She looks up. He can see that whatever she was reading hurt. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 52.
C: ROSE
D: How come our mothers, the same women who leave us on the doorstep of this school as infants so they can to go back to being Guardians, still get to tell us what to do?
C: MASON
D: ...I wanted to see if you’re okay.
C: ROSE
D: You didn’t get that many good shots in. I’ll live.
C: MASON
D: I didn’t mean that.
N: Rose rises, and face to face with Mason --
C: ROSE
D: Mason, I really only have two uses for you right now. And I’m not in the mood to spar, so...
N: She kisses him. Starts to pull at his shirt. He pulls away.
C: MASON
D: Whoa. Whoa. Wait a minute, Rose. I can’t believe I’m actually going to say this -- but I’m not here for that. Now. In this moment. I thought we could talk. With everything that’s been going on, I thought... I could be a friend. Just pretend I’m Lissa. Don’t laugh. What would she do now?
C: ROSE
D: ...You’d sit cross-legged... and one of us would put our head in the other’s lap and we’d argue over who had the worst day -- which obviously today I would win.
N: Mason sits, crosses his legs. His lap is ready.
C: MASON
D: I’ll be the judge of that. Legit, this had better be good.
N: Rose smiles. Then lies down with her head in his lap. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 53.
C: ROSE
D: I just wanted to make Lissa feel better...
S: INT. MOROI DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Christian moves down the hall, most others keeping their distance. He arrives at his door, where a small wrapped BOX sits. He looks around, curious about and wary of its source. He opens it. Inside, Lissa’s unicorn, and a note: I wondered if you knew how to say unicorn in Old Moroi? As he allows himself a touched smile.
S: INT. LISSA AND MIA’S DORM ROOM – NIGHT
N: Lissa dresses for yet another party. The dress. The pin in her hair. She stares in the mirror, hollow. Then, a KNOCK -- She opens the door to Dimitri holding an ornate wooden box:
C: DIMITIRI
D: This was left with the Matron for you. I already checked it.
N: He hands it to her, politely exiting. She checks it out. It has a delicate pearl inlay. She opens it to find a parchment scroll. She unrolls it, seeing the Old Moroi passage she was working on earlier within a larger reading. As she opens the card that came inside the box, we hear --
C: CHRISTIAN
D: The passage you read today was an oath to slay demons. The rest of this passage, the parts that they don’t feel the need to teach you, says why. You fight for family, for justice, and for love. I agree. Christian. PS. I think unicorn in Moroi? Is Lissa...
E: V.O.
N: As Lissa stares at these words, lit up...
C: VICTOR
D: We were wrong about Lissa...
E: PRELAP
S: INT. ROYAL COURT PRISON CELLS - NIGHT
N: As the red eyes of a BOUND AND BEATEN STRIGOI glare from the shadows of its cell, the Queen listens to Victor. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 54.
C: VICTOR
D: She’s not ready. Not emotionally or any other way.
N: WHAM! The Strigoi throws itself against the cage door. Hissing and baring its fangs. The Queen doesn’t flinch.
C: QUEEN
D: Ready is a luxury we don’t have. We already live our lives in quiet dread, but with the Strigoi getting bolder those lunatics on the right will legislate the very air we breathe in the name of keeping us safe... While the pie-eyed dreamers on the left whisper about releasing the Guardians from their service, threatening the very protections our species needs to survive...
C: VICTOR
D: She doesn’t have a political bone in her body.
C: QUEEN
D: Exactly. She is untainted, able to see the good in all people. Everything I was before the vipers nest made me cynical and haggard.
C: VICTOR
D: You are hardly haggard, If you could just hold on a bit longer...
C: QUEEN
D: I’m tired, Victor.
N: WHAM! The Strigoi hits the cage again. Victor shoots a wary look at it. The Queen remains unbothered.
C: QUEEN
D: And I’d like to live out the rest of my days in some semblance of quiet. I think I’ve earned tha --
E: CONT'D
N: But the Strigoi ATTACKS again, only this time the door RIPS OPEN and it heads straight for her. The Queen’s GUARDIANS leap in and SLAM the Strigoi to the ground. One grabs a BLADE and SLAMS it onto the Strigoi’s neck, decapitating it. The Queen stares at its writhing body. VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 55.
C: QUEEN
D: We’re going to be late for the party.
E: CONT'D
N: As she sweeps away...
S: INT. PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT
N: ... We HEAR the CLINKS of GLASSES. As the Queen raises hers:
C: QUEEN
D: A toast to you all on St. Vladimir’s feast day. And to the service today. The last I’ll witness as your sovereign. It is time to name the next.
E: to Irena
N: The crowd is surprised. Irena and Marie Conta share a look.
C: HIGH PRIESTESS IRENA
D: Your Majesty, protocol demands the announcement be made in a more formal setting.
C: QUEEN
D: Protocol can kiss my aging Royal buttocks. Protocol may be helpful as a tool, but when the knife wields the chef, it ceases to be of use. I am ready to name my heir.
C: MARIE CONTA
D: We’ll still need to vote to approve him, Your Majesty. Wouldn’t it be prudent to survey the candidates with the privy council first to ensure a swift and unanimous vote of the twelve families to approve?
C: QUEEN
D: I think we all know the likelihood of a unanimous vote for any of the so-called “frontrunners” here.
N: “Frontrunner” Marie fights a scowl, as standing next to Irena, Tatiana, sips champagne, enjoying the proceedings.
C: QUEEN
D: But there is someone we’ve overlooked... Having ruled since I was a girl, I know the virtue of youth, and of compassion in this position. But I am old.
E: CONT'D MORE
N: VA 101 - Revised Network Draft (7/26/21) 56.
C: QUEEN
D: And dare I say cynical. Still, fear not, the future of the monarchy will be in good hands.
E: CONT'D
N: At that, the Queen turns to Lissa.
C: QUEEN
D: As the next heir to the throne, I name Vasilissa Dragomir.
E: CONT'D
