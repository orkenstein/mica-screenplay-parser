S: 1 INT. TRAIN - DAY 1
N: DARKNESS - NOW The beautiful CHIMING SOUNDS OF SPACE TRAVEL through the COSMOS... DOTS OF LIGHT whiz past our face. They could be stars at lightspeed, or... SUBWAY LIGHTS FLICKER ON - in a flash we see PALE, SULLEN FACES, riding into a bleak future, and hear the INDUSTRIAL CLATTER. It's dark, claustrophobic, obscure... the rhythmic beat of track and wheel-clicks engulf us. The lights flicker back on and hold as we see a half dozen SOLDIERS in BROWN CAMO, steel- eyed, prepared for whatever may be at the end of the TUNNEL.
C: ZERO IN on TWO:
D: KABLE, 30-something, roughneck... focused, determined; eyes burning with internalized emotion...
N: ... and SANDRA, late 20s, undeniably hot but tough as hell - both are in shackles & cuffs, being roughly transported through underground tunnels, knocked and shoved around. Uniformed GUARDS roam the train, looking pissed off - their swagger seems to mask FEAR. KABLE is meditating, or exhausted - hard to tell. The GIRL makes eye contact w/ him.
C: SANDRA
D: Sandra.
N: KABLE says nothing, just stares at her, stoic.
C: SANDRA
D: My name is Sandra.
E: cont'd
C: GUARD
D: Shut the fuck up.
N: Because he can, the GUARD takes a swing at KABLE'S head with a BILLY CLUB... CRACK! (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 1 CONTINUED: 1 KABLE'S skull snaps back into the window. The GUARD swings again, this time nailing KABLE square in the stomach.
C: SANDRA
D: Putcher dick away...
E: to the GUARD, a snarl
C: GUARD
D: Get some.
N: CRACKK!! CRACK!! CRACKK!! ... CRACK!! SANDRA is buckled over, awkwardly, hands behind her back tethered to the seat, head dripping blood. KABLE jerks against his restraints, every inch of him wanting to RIP THE MOTHERFUCKER APART... He uses his elbow to help her back up, but SANDRA fights through it, sits back up and spits blood - she can handle herself. The CAMERA holds TIGHT on KABLE and SANDRA... KABLE lets a glob of blood dangle from his mouth, biting his lip, bearing it... we hear the CRUNCHING SOUND of the CLUB working on the others... and the METALLIC RUMBLE and CLATTER of the TRAIN - growing louder, POUNDING, slamming into our brains, blotting out all thought... until...
S: 2 INT. TUNNEL #1 - DAY 2
N: POV: we are RUNNING, ragged, full sprint, down a TUNNEL towards dirty white DAYLIGHT... NO MUSIC - just heavy breath, KABLE'S HEARTBEAT and the sound of his boots bouncing off the concrete... Others are running with us - SOLDIERS with weapons... at the tunnel's end: vaguely defined shapes of buildings, smoke, sky... Our POV WHITES OUT as we...
S: 3 EXT. SPAWN POINT #1 - CONTINUOUS 3
N: ... smash into the DAYLIGHT. Smoke plumes hang from a recent skirmish. KABLE climbs over burning debris, gun raised, as SANDRA and the other soldiers disappear into the grey mist.
S: 4 EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 4
N: KABLE emerges from the smoke into... (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 4 CONTINUED: 4 ... a DESTROYED CITY - PHILLY? DETROIT? NY? Seemingly out of character, he LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR SLO-MO and lands in an OVERDRAMATIC, ROCKSTAR POSE (Nine Inch Nails, Coachella 2005). In sequence, multicolored LEDs on his weapon COME TO LIFE - accompanied by a low frequency hum that seems to pierce somewhere below human hearing. The MULTIPLE TURRETS spin, then snap into place. GO TIME. 5 OTHER SPAWN POINTS 5 Other BROWN SOLDIERS emerge like SNAKES out of DIRT HOLES and INTO THE LIGHT. They crouch and spread out. 6 SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 6 What appear like BUZZING FLIES swarm thru the grey air - at a closer look, they are like tiny BALL BEARINGS that move like hummingbirds, magnetically controlled. The swarm splits apart - each FLY connects with a different SOLDIER - they hover one foot above and two feet behind the SOLDIER'S head. 7 SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - COVER 7 KABLE slides behind a shredded telephone pole and TAKES COVER. The sound of trains, weapons, soldiers all fade away... until... NOTHING. DEAD QUIET. SUDDENLY - A BULLET WHIZZES by KABLE's face - a pause - THEN we hear a GUNSHOT. Another BULLET WHIRS by his leg and another by his shoulder - after the bullets pass, we hear the GUNSHOTS. See the lightning, wait for the thunder. In the peripheral a SOLDIER in DEEP BLUE CAMO runs from behind an old car to a brick staircase. Then another BLUE runs the opposite way, closer in the foreground. BROWNS VS. BLUES?? The SILENCE is crawling, deafening, and then... BOOM. ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Suddenly we are in IRAQ TIMES TEN... KABLE'S eyes glance down at his WEAPON - the turrets quickly shift and rotate - he whips it up in a flash and RETURNS FIRE into the mist: THOOM! THOOM! The shells puncture air and connect distantly... (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 7 CONTINUED: 7 The air ripples all around him, his world closing in... he breaks free and runs toward an open street - THE TURRETS READJUST - he efficiently wastes two BLUES with automatic fire. 8 SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - OPEN STREET 8 A couple of PEDESTRIANS walk across the street, totally IGNORING THE VIOLENCE. KABLE makes a perfect 90 degree cut and wraps around a street-lamp and into the alley. A BUM holds out a can with a couple of coins and SHAKES it. From an aerial POV we see the area swarming with BROWN & BLUE combatants and a dozen CIVILIANS. In the top right corner of our frame we see the DULL REFLECTION of a FACE, somewhat transparent, watching the battle, tungsten red (similar to your own reflection on a TV). We SNAP BACK to the ground - the whole area is a BATTLEZONE. KABLE lines up another BLUE climbing the fire-escape to the third floor window - and then, coming from the REAR SURROUND SPEAKERS, behind us: A VOICE - almost a whisper, too clean and distinct to be outdoors in this environment... and TOO YOUNG to possibly belong to KABLE.
C: VOICE
D: Eat shit please.
E: O.S. clean, disconnected
N: THWIPPP!! The BLUE drops like a sack. KABLE perfectly cuts back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front. Inside a CLERK "air" bags groceries for an empty store. A BROWN SOLDIER sets up a TRIPOD MACHINE GUN and aims for a bunker a hundred yards north. The distant BLUE targets seem almost robotically unaware. The BROWN SOLDIER plants his left hand on the ground for stability, right hand twisting the grip-lock - and squeezing the trigger: TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT!!!! TATATATATATATATATA TAT!! The BLUES fall, some clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to the ground, dead. Another team of BLUES rock their heads around to focus on him. Uh oh... BOOOOOSH!!!! The BROWN TRIPOD GUNNER is vaporized from the knees up... the FOREARM that supported him is standing straight up, cleanly severed at the elbow. It slowly wobbles over and connects with the TWO LEGS severed at the knees. The THREE LIMBS fall into each other, forming a flesh and bone TRIPOD. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 8 CONTINUED: 8 VROOOOOOSH!!! CHUKUNK, CHUKUNK!! A SNOWPLOW BARRELS THROUGH THE DESTRUCTION, pushing the bodies and debris out of the way and clearing a path, one streaked with crimson red and burnt flesh. It moves fast and vanishes into the smoke clouds. 9 SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - STREET 9 Down the road, KABLE saves an EAST-INDIAN WOMAN from getting obliterated by shoving her out of the way of the blazing truck. As KABLE turns to waste another BLUE, the EAST-INDIAN WOMAN gets right back up... walking into and getting obliterated by another TRUCK. It's creepy - robotic, but violent and too real - like a programmed suicide.
C: VOICE
D: Can't say I didn't try...
E: O.S.
N: We sense emotion in KABLE'S cold eyes - then they flicker to the peripheral. 10 SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - 2ND FLOOR BUILDING 10 Tracking along a row of blown out windows a BLUE is taking aim; we SNAP ZOOM in... SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE IMAGE: The transparent GHOST OF A FACE, as though projected on glass. The LIPS MOVE in sync with:
C: VOICE
D: Shit! Shit!
E: O.S.
N: KABLE spins, TOO LATE - BUT: from the level directly below the SNIPER - through an open doorway - we see a BROWN SOLDIER, BLASTING STRAIGHT UP THROUGH THE CEILING! The BLUE is BLOWN TO CHUNKS. 11 SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - STREET 11 The BROWN runs out and hits the curb; CONCRETE AND MEAT collapse on the spot where she stood... it's SANDRA. KABLE gives her covering fire as she heads his way. They bolt for a corner - KABLE reaches protection first. He stops to let SANDRA catch up, and in that instant - HER BRAINS GET BLOWN TO JELL-O. Blood and particles splatter over KABLE's gear.
C: VOICE
D: Suckage.
E: O.S.
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 11 CONTINUED: 11 Without hesitation KABLE turns and wastes two more BLUES. Up ahead HE SEES IT: an OCTAGON STEEL SHED with small GLOWING EMERALD GREEN WINDOWS. He makes for it. The little FLY following him is picked out of the air by a stray shot - PLINK!
C: VOICE
D: ... what the...!
E: O.S. cont'd
N: Bullets and shells chop up everything around KABLE, but he's QUICK... A SHELL smacks his shoulder HARD, almost knocking him off his feet - shredding the BROWN CAMO and revealing the FLEXIBLE BODY ARMOR UNDERNEATH. He scrambles to the octagon's entrance and BAILS IN.
S: 12 INT. SAVE POINT #1 12
N: KABLE steps into the middle of the vacant steel room. The second he breaks the GREEN LASER, FLOOD LIGHTS blast on all around the BATTLEFIELD. A SUBMARINE ALARM sounds from loudspeakers everywhere, echoing through the streets, CYCLING DOWN. The battle is over - session complete.
S: 13 EXT. SAVE POINT #1 13
N: KABLE steps out. The LEDS on his weapon blink off in sequence... ARMED GUARDS are EVERYWHERE, rounding up the I-Con's. [I-CONs (I-Convicts) are the combatants -- death row inmates/lifers, of which there are never a shortage. GENERI-CON's (Generic Convicts) are the street traffic that lend unpredictability and realism to the battlefield... they are computer controlled NPCs (non player characters)... petty thiefs and criminals who are risking their lives by participating to commute their sentences] A DOZEN GUARDS collect weapons - TWO approach KABLE. His eyes are pure MURDER; SANDRA'S brain matter still drips from him. HE WHIPS UP THE WEAPON, POINTS IT AT A GUARD'S HEAD AND PULLS THE TRIGGER - (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 13 CONTINUED: 13 NOTHING. The GUARD doesn't even flinch. The WEAPON is DEAD, dormant; they all knew it. The GUARDS have a good LAUGH... KABLE is CLUBBED from behind - we...
T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: 14 INT. TRAIN - LATER 14
N: Back on the rattling TRAIN, where we started. The SURVIVING SOLDIERS - both BROWN and BLUE - are shackled to the rail - wounded, exhausted, hollow eyed.
C: BLUE SOLDIER 1
D: Good run, Kable.
N: KABLE only looks to the floor.
C: KABLE
D: My name's Tillman.
E: quietly
C: BROWN SOLDIER 1
D: Whatever your name is. You got to the save point fast.
C: BROWN SOLDIER 2
D: So the fuck what? No one's getting out of here alive.
C: BLUE SOLDIER 1
D: I am. I'm going to make it.
N: The cynical BROWN just shakes his head.
C: BROWN SOLDIER 2
D: Sure you will.
C: BLUE SOLDIER 1 (tuning the BROWN out,
D: turning his attention to
C: KABLE)
D: They say you only got three battles left til you get out...
N: KABLE says nothing. The CAMERA pushes in on a TATTOO on his forearm: a simple outline of a black box with the words inside: I AM RIGHT HERE WITH YOU. [MUSIC: Aldo Nova, "LIFE IS JUST A FANTASY" kicks in...] WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
S: 15 INT. LAB - TIME INDETERMINATE 15
N: A spartan, underground LAB. A PLAIN-CLOTHES TECH sits on a stool holding a simple REMOTE; on the table next to him is a SMALL METAL DISH. In front of him, floating in the air, is one of the little metallic FLIES. He pokes at it - it instantly jukes left; again - it jukes right... almost faster than the eye can follow. No way he could ever touch it. Semi-satisfied, he holds out the metal dish and clicks the remote. The FLY drops into the dish - CLINK. CLOSE-UP: the little gunmetal ball is black and dented on one side - probably the one we saw get knocked out of the air. There is a PINHOLE GLASS LENS on the other end. The TECH picks it up with thumb and forefinger and holds the lens up to his eyes. Switch to: POV of the FLY CAM: the TECH'S face, extreme wide angle, examining. The image flickers, glitches - then CUTS TO: WHITE NOISE.

D: Gina, when was the last time you saw someone volunteer to be murdered? I'm sure you know that every last one of our Slayers is a bona fide death row inmate - ...each one offered a chance to participate as an alternative to their sentence. Stay alive for thirty sessions and get set free... that's not a bad God damned deal.

D: I'd remind your audience that Slayers was put together with the full cooperation and approval of the United States federal government... that the revenue it produces is responsible for funding our entire prison system - keeping the bad guys behind bars... and that the prop was voted for by a cock solid 68% of the American public.

D: Simple.
N: A 3-D ANIMATED GRAPHIC accompanies his explanation - the VIRTUAL CAMERA zooms in to the FROZEN SOLDIER'S head - and then INSIDE, passing thru transparent layers.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: It begins with a single nano-cell planted in the motor cortex of the brain -- this cell can replicate, replacing the cells `round it with perfect copies...
E: cont'd
N: We see a cartoon image of a tiny nano-cell - labeled with a bold, block letter N. The nano-cell approaches a normal cell next to it... there is a flash; now the cell next to it has turned into an exact copy of the nano. This continues, multiplying exponentially, until we zoom back to reveal that the entire brain has been converted to nano-cells.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: ... these copied cells contain remote access functionality. Therefore, nano plus cortex equals the nanex.
E: cont'd
N: The graphic zooms back further to show a pair of hands working a retro ATARI-style joystick... animated waves indicate a wireless transmission from the joystick to the Slayer, who unfreezes and flies into action. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 23 CONTINUED: 23

N: The prison yard is a vast expanse of white - it could be a chalk mine, or the surface of a strange planet. Distant towers mark the perimeter. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 28 CONTINUED: 28 Other groups of shackled prisoners can be seen in the distance, trotting along in lines. Trails of thick magenta smoke snake across the yard, sucked by the wind. The ROGUE PRISONER stomps down on the GUARD'S face one last time - his shoes are made of cloth. CRUNCH. The GUARD stops moving. The PRISONER starts to run for it across the white terrain. A group of GUARDS appear to round up the remaining prisoners. They club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind to the fleeing ROGUE... they merely watch him go, impassive. In a moment, we see why - when the ROGUE PRISONER crosses between the two distant towers he is jerked to the ground by an invisible field. Sound? Light? Magnetism? His body goes into spasms; blood foams from his ears, mouth, eyes.
T: CUT TO:
S: 29 EXT. PRISON REC AREA - DAY 29
N: Fingers run through white powder, making patterns. A black shadow crosses the frame, accompanied by a low hum; some sort of aircraft. KABLE looks up as the shadow tracks across him; we never see the craft. He looks out across the yard. KABLE is sitting in what seems to be a minimal REC AREA cut out of the white terrain. He sits by himself wearing a white cloth hoodie, eyes dark, head down, silent. Across the yard a group of prisoners are playing basketball; EVERY SINGLE PLAYER is SKYING for dunks. We focus in on KABLE'S TATTOO: I Am Right Here With You... In the yard a CRIPPLE, his two legs stiff with braces, walks ROBOTICALLY along on crutches. KABLE watches him, expressionless. It triggers a memory... FLASH TO:
S: 30 EXT. SUN-SOAKED EXTERIOR 30
N: A LITTLE GIRL, no more than two, walks along on her DADDY'S feet... giggling, trusting... her hands grip his big fingers... taking each big ROBOT STEP with him... FLASH TO: WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
S: 31 EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY 31
N: A BASKETBALL comes out of nowhere and KNOCKS THE CRUTCH OUT from under the CRIPPLE, sending him ass-up on the asphalt. Prisoners JEER.
C: FREEK
D: Kable. Kable.
E: quiet, conspiratorial
N: We see that KABLE has drawn the pattern in his tattoo with his finger in the white powder; at the sound of the voice he runs his hand through it, wiping it away. A wiry, jittery dude of indeterminate age is sitting next to KABLE. KABLE doesn't even turn to look.
C: KABLE
D: My name is Tillman, freak.
C: FREEK
D: Tillmans, yeah, Tillmans, I knew that, they said you name's was Tillmans... just sittin, always sittin, always lookin, just lookin... like me, I keep my holes down... you got to, man... a dude inevitably start to break up, start to crack and break up everyday, never know you gonna die today or live another two, three. You never do know. All these niggaz gonna snap, snap, snap, one by one, every last one, all of em. Yeah but not you. Twenty seven battles and three to go... no one ever got that close before, no one even done ten games without gettin they brains shot... but Kable, Kable, Kable, he just sittin, lookin, like he got a plan, he already somewhere else, he on a mission, nothin' get in his way, never break, never snap, never say shit, just take care of his business, niggaz get spooked by that shit. You spooky.
N: KABLE turns slowly to look him in the eye, says nothing.
C: FREEK
D: Spooky.

D: I killed my best friend.
S: 32 INT. PRISON - NIGHT 32
N: A prisoner sings Metallica off key, but balls to the walls:
C: PRISONER
D: Master! Master! Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings - Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams...
N: KABLE is alone in his cell. At the base of the single door is a SLIDING COMPARTMENT to push food through - it opens. But instead of a tray, someone pushes through a wrinkled photograph. KABLE picks it up and looks - a WOMAN, just a blur of golden hair, laughing, and a LITTLE GIRL... the same one in KABLE'S vision.
C: WOMAN
D: You want to get back to them.
E: O.S.
N: KABLE is stunned, silent. He sits on the ground, shoulder leaning against the heavy door, staring at the girl in the picture.
C: WOMAN
D: It's all you think about. It's the only thing that keeps you alive.
E: O.S. cont'd
N: Her words are like hammer blows to his guts; he wants to weep but he's too strong, too internalized. He steels himself.
C: KABLE
D: Who's talking?
N: She pushes through a white NOTECARD and PEN.
C: WOMAN
D: Sign it.
E: O.S.
C: KABLE
D: What?
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 32 CONTINUED: 32 KABLE doesn't take it.
C: WOMAN
D: Sign it... please, Tillman. My son David is your biggest fan. He prays for you.
E: O.S.
N: This takes KABLE by surprise; he reluctantly takes the pen and card. He writes something on it and sticks it back through the slider. PFFHHT. The WOMAN stabs KABLE'S hand with a LANCET - she draws out a little blood. KABLE yanks his hand back out.
C: WOMAN
D: Need to prove it's authentic. Makes it worth more.
E: O.S. cont'd
C: KABLE
D: Why would anyone want my name?
C: WOMAN
D: You don't even know what's going on out there, do you? Damn...
E: O.S. beat
N: At the far end of the solitary block a BUZZER sounds - then the SLIDE and SLAM of heavy steel.
C: WOMAN
D: Gotta go.
E: O.S. cont'd
N: KABLE jumps up and pulls himself against the door - a lifeline is slipping away...
C: KABLE
D: Wait. How did you get this picture? Have you seen them?
E: he holds the wrinkled photo to the window
N: He peers through the little window at the top of the door, but she's GONE... Instead, a group of PRISONERS are being led down the corridor to their NEW CELLS. We recognize grim, battered faces from the yard - these are the men that stood by as the GUARD was being beaten down. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 32 CONTINUED: (2) 32 DISTINCTIVE PRISONER - hands cuffed behind his back, makes * eye contact with KABLE as he walks by. *
T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: 33 EXT. PRISON RUNNING TRACK - DAY 33
N: A desolate white RUNNING TRACK; a guard TOWER overlooks... the field is empty but for ONE MAN: KABLE. He's busting ass around the track, pouring sweat. We're right there with him, CLOSE-UP - profile, full speed... we hear the HARD BREATHING, the feet pounding dirt, like we're INSIDE HIS HEAD.
T: CUT TO:
S: 34 EXT. URBAN DOWNTOWN #1 - SIMULTANEOUS 34
N: WIDE LOCK OFF - KABLE, 90 feet high, a MURAL painted on the side of a BUILDING. It's an AD for SLAYERS: KABLE in FULL COMBAT MODE, cutting loose with a FLAME THROWER.
S: 35 EXT. PRISON RUNNING TRACK - SIMULTANEOUS 35
N: KABLE, running - we're even CLOSER NOW... he's pushing himself beyond exhaustion, pure focus...
S: 36 EXT. URBAN DOWNTOWN #2 - DAY 36
N: Different city, same story - KABLE, a towering BILLBOARD PROJECTION... endless lanes of FREEWAY GRIDLOCK sprawling beneath...
S: 37 EXT. PRISON RUNNING TRACK - SIMULTANEOUS 37
N: KABLE, staggering, near collapse, lungs burning...
S: 38 EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY 38
N: The ICONIC IMAGE of KABLE on the famous TIMES SQUARE VIDEO WALL, now even more massive... the STOCK TICKERS reeling off disaster... he's like GODZILLA frozen amongst the SKYSCRAPERS...
S: 39 EXT. PRISON RUNNING TRACK - SIMULTANEOUS 39
N: KABLE finally flames out... he breaks down to a jog, then doubles over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath. CUT OUT WIDE: KABLE is ant-size and insignificant on the long, barren field, under a vast grey sky... ALONE. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 39 CONTINUED: 39 Hold for a long beat, and...
T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: 40 INT. A DOZEN DARK ROOMS - DAY 40
N: MONTAGE of GAMERS' FACES, preparing to GET IT ON... All shapes, colors and styles, but all RICH AND POWERFUL-looking. Some are sweating, some calm, some beat red, others have guitar-playing twitch faces...
S: 41 EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #2 - DAY 41
N: SHOCK CUT into the HEAT OF BATTLE. CHAOS, CONFUSION... KABLE blasts through a cloud of exploding debris... A BROWN to his left is BLOWN IN HALF - the LEGS KEEP RUNNING...
S: 42 EXT. SLAYER BATTLEGROUND #2 - STREET 42
N: TED NUGENT, in BROWN camo, lines up a BLUE SNIPER in a 3rd story window with a CROSS-BOW. He releases the arrow and pins the BLUE's HEAD to the window sill.
C: TED NUGENT
D: Damn, I gonna have to eat you now, son.
N: An UPSIDE-DOWN CAR comes SLIDING down the street on it's hood and slams into TED NUGENT, VAPORIZING him...
S: 43 EXT SLAYER BATTLEGROUND #2 43
N: Another five BLUE SOLDIERS are taken out. Their bodies drop to the ground, gruesome goodness. The FIVE BALL BEARING CAMERAS quickly flock together and check out each body as a swarming unit. From a wider shot, they look like flies on shit... after checking out the recently deleted, they zip off towards the closest save point...

C: VOICE
D: Oh shit... oh shit...
S: 48 INT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #2 - 2ND FLOOR 48
N: KABLE takes up a spot from a second level vantage point - from here we see a small group of BLUES moving down the block, scanning for survivors.
C: VOICE
D: Wul hello thar...
N: KABLE watches himself SWITCH TURRETS on his WEAPON. He brings up a SNIPER SIGHT and locks in on a target.
C: VOICE
D: Wait for it...
E: cont'd
N: CLOSE-UP of KABLE'S EAR: just then he hears the SUBTLEST OF SOUNDS creeping up behind. Whoever's controlling him doesn't seem to have noticed - he's too focused on the enemies in the sights. We can see the tension in KABLE'S FACE - he's helpless, trying to fight it, willing his player to take notice.
C: KABLE
D: Turn me around God damn it...
E: whispering
C: VOICE
D: What'd he say?
N: A trickle of sweat runs down into KABLE'S EYE. The SOUND is more distinct now, CLOSER... he's practically shaking from the struggle to overcome the control. POV: someone has reached the top of the stairs... KABLE, seen from behind, comes into view crouched by the blown out window.
C: VOICE
D: My boy gotta take a piss or something?

E: cont'd
N: KABLE SPINS - FAST. The TURRET is ALREADY REVOLVING when he squeezes the trigger... The ARMOR-PIERCING SHELL takes SNEAKY BLUE by surprise, blowing him out the back of the building... The BLUES in the street take notice. It's a matter of seconds... KABLE makes a run for it as the floor starts to DISINTEGRATE behind him in a shitstorm of bullets. SHRAPNEL drills his back, absorbed by the BODY ARMOR.
S: 49 EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #2 49
N: He hits daylight and turns a corner in time to see a group of * BROWNS scattering... a live ARTILLERY SHELL skitters across * the pavement, belching smoke. * BOOM. KABLE is running... he looks to his right - A FROZEN MOMENT: The SAVE POINT up ahead on the SPINNING RAILROAD. * The MOMENT passes; KABLE looks back over his shoulder - a rush of ROARING FLAME is COMING - FAST... at the moment of IMPACT we - * SMASH TO BLACK

S: 52 INT. SIMON'S HOUSE - HALLWAY 52
N: SIMON - 18, pale and lanky, unkempt shaggy hair; wearing a vintage Guns `n' Roses T-shirt from the Appetite For Destruction Tour - walks down a long, high ceilinged crystal hall with marble floors, macking on the sandwich... passes through a glass tunnel running through the interior of a massive, exotic aquarium - he's alone in what appears to be a vast, cold mansion.
S: 53 INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 53
N: SIMON'S ROOM is simple - FOUR WALLS and a CEILING, each one a 3-D, corner-to-corner VIDEO SCREEN. The HD level of the screens is virtually ABSOLUTE - the flesh and blood SIMON himself is just another element in a HIGH-DOLLAR/HIGH-TECH SPACE. The FLOOR is ALL BED. SIMON PADS IN, takes a spinning STUNT JUMP and ROLLS onto his back in a big ass pile of pillows, sandwich intact. The SCREENS are a jumble of floating frames, competing for prominence in the 3-D space... muted VID CHATS, STOCK TICKERS, SPORTS SCORES, ultraviolent SLAYERS playback, etc. Everything dynamic, everything moving. One whole wall is apparently a REAL TIME monitor of the SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND, with updated statistics... POINTS LEADER, FRAG COUNT - we notice that KABLE leads these categories; a video loop of KABLE in action beside his name illustrates the point. In the FOREFRONT of SIMON'S attention: KABLE EARNS 800 UPGRADE POINTS A set of dynamic frames allow him to scroll through a series of revolving images - WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT, BODY ARMOR. SIMON interacts with the 3-D environment using HAND GESTURES - he can SLIDE, SQUEEZE, PULL AND SCROLL the images just by moving his fingers in the air. He flips past various TRANSFORMERS-looking SUPER GUNS... (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 53 CONTINUED: 53
C: SIMON
D: Gay... gay... gay... super gay... hm.
N: He stops on an animated graphic. A SEXY FEMALE VOICE breaks it all down for us:
C: FEMALE VOICE
D: Swarmers. The latest innovation from Browning, this self detonating cartridge offers the widest and deadliest spray available from a full tracking, cornering ordnance.
N: A VIDEO DEMO shows the fired cartridge SPLIT into two-dozen smaller shells that FLASH OUT like a swarm of bees, wind around a corner and utterly SHRED a TEST DUMMY.
C: SIMON
D: Daddy like...
N: An ANNOYING GIRL'S VOICE pops in, along with a VID CHAT SCREEN that takes over the MAIN WALL. She looks about 16 - skinny, skanky, kind of hot.
C: ANNOYING GIRL
D: Simon!
C: SIMON
D: Fan-girl, stop hacking. If I want you unmuted I'll unmute you.
C: ANNOYING GIRL
D: You suck, Simon - you're going to get my boyfriend killed before he can get out of jail and fill me up with his hot seed.
C: SIMON
D: Uh huh.
N: Another GIRL - 17, cute, stoned - chimes in.
T: CUTE STONED GIRL
N: Simon, I just wanna play you. Forget about that star-fucker.
C: ANNOYING GIRL
D: Shut up bitch.
N: SIMON casually waves his hand at the frame, like flicking at a fly; ANNOYING GIRL is wiped away, bringing CUTE STONED GIRL to the forefront. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 53 CONTINUED: (2) 53
T: CUTE STONED GIRL
N: Thanks baby. When can I meet you for like reals? SIMON notices a metallic sparkle from the GIRL'S TONGUE.
C: SIMON
D: What is that? Aaaa.
E: like a dentist
N: He reaches out and "pinches" the screen, ZOOMING IN close as she sticks out her tongue - it fills the wall... a dozen wicked looking BLACK TONGUE RINGS stud the wet pink flesh, TEN FEET HIGH.
C: SIMON
D: Woah.
E: cont'd
N: He quickly unsqueezes, zooming back out. The GIRL'S eyes are rolled back in her head, euphoric; she's WASTED.
T: CUTE STONED GIRL
N: You like me? A THIRD GIRL pops in, filling the opposite wall.
C: SHELLY
D: What's up, loser?
C: SIMON
D: Hey sissy.
N: This is SIMON'S SISTER, SHELLY, 14. Frosted up lips, eyes and hair like a Tokyo hooker.
C: SHELLY
D: Mom says - let me see, go to college, move the fuck out, and... oh yeah, you're a sick retard, you're pathetic, and you smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.
C: SIMON
D: Wanna make out?
C: SHELLY
D: You wish. I can't wait til they cut you off, Simian.
N: With a wave of his hand he wipes her image off the screen. TWO MORE video chats pop up - TWIN 21-YEAR OLD GIRLS, stupidly hot. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 53 CONTINUED: (3) 53

E: in unison
C: SIMON

C: TWIN 1
D: Mmmmm, now that we have your attention, here's another offer you can't refuse.
C: SIMON
D: Here we go.
N: When TWIN 2 speaks, it is with a MAN'S VOICE. The accent is EASTERN EUROPEAN.
C: TWIN 2
D: Fifty million euros for control of Kable, instant transfer to the account of your choice.
C: SIMON
D: Question: do I look like I need the money? We've discussed this before - Kable is not for sale.
C: TWIN 1
D: Baby... make it a hundred.
E: feeling herself up
C: SIMON
D: It's been real.
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 53 CONTINUED: (4) 53 SIMON snaps his fingers; all the windows close simultaneously. SIMON makes a clicking sound with his tongue in the new silence. Peace at last. BY THEMSELVES, the screens come BACK TO LIFE.
C: SIMON
D: D'oh.
E: cont'd
N: The instant chat boxes are gone, replaced by a soundless, GRAINY VIDEO LOOP - there is something sinister about the lo- fi image... it looks like the feed from an old SURVEILLANCE CAM: Two men are sitting in a room... it's silent, but one of them seems to be SCREAMING - he lifts a gun...
C: SIMON
D: What the fuh...?
E: cont'd
N: ... waits a beat... and SHOOTS THE OTHER MAN IN THE HEAD. Black blood pools. This is REAL. The loop repeats. When the SHOOTER turns his face toward the camera, SIMON freezes the frame with a gesture and ZOOMS IN. It's KABLE. A MESSAGE is typed across the screen one letter at a time - we may recognize the retro chicago font from the HUMANZ video prank earlier: want to talk to him?

PAVEMENT flies by... sun SLAMS rainbow flares into the lens... ROLLER SKATES break frame, outpacing us... We're cruising along with a group of YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, skating like ROBOTS through a CITY PARK... Roller-Dolly follows HOT GIRLS in DAISY DUKES, knee socks and tube tops, belly rings and tatoos in the small of their backs... ATHLETIC DUDES, shirtless, gun racks and six packs... They SWING THEIR ARMS mechanically, identically... synced with each other and the beat of the soundtrack... each face plastered with an absurd, exaggerated GRIN... let's FUCKING PARTY!!! We are in a super-saturated world... NOT virtual/animated, but absolutely real - yet the color and immediacy of it is heightened, off-kilter. On the GRASS, a gang of TOKYO POP PUNK ROCKERS are having a WATER BATTLE, blasting and soaking each other with big plastic WATER CANNONS like something out of SLAYERS... A REDHEAD, soaking wet, is FEELING UP HER OWN BREASTS, totally OBLIVIOUS to her surroundings... One of the SKATERS, out of control, PLOWS RIGHT INTO HER at full speed... The SKATER takes a ride on concrete, grinding flesh off her bare legs... she wobbles to her feet, EYES STREAMING TEARS but STILL GRINNING ecstatically... A guy in a PRIEST OUTFIT holding brightly colored helium balloons looks on impassively; then spots something of interest and breaks off SPRINTING FULL SPEED... People are DANCING - the corniest moves ever... MAKING OUT on the ground... and in the middle of it all...

She doesn't seem to notice the little bird munching away; she stands in the middle of the PARK, looking around, lost.

He turns her around and presses ANGIE'S back up against the base of the sculpture, ROUGH, hands all over her/inside her; SLOBBERING down her neck and shoulders... ANGIE just looks straight ahead... her EYES move to a nearby building - the side is an ANIMATED BILLBOARD that has switched to a promo for SLAYERS, with KABLE featured prominently.

N: We get our first wider view of the room. Much more cramped than SIMON'S ROOM... like SIMON'S, the room is dominated by a GIANT VIDEO SCREEN, but just the front wall... there are other - smaller, paper thin - screens mounted in various spots and leaning against walls; GARBAGE and TECH GEAR all over the floor. GORGE - late 30s, MORBIDLY OBESE - is contained by a massive automated rolling chair, like the Escalade of Rascals. The HUMANZ message has taken over his screen and he's GOING FUCKING BALLISTIC, throwing shit at it and gesturing crazily to the wall-mounted MOTION SENSORS with his hands, trying to get the image back.

He pulls out something, and drops like a sack of potatoes to the floor - FRIED POTATOES. He lands on a couple of dumbbells, his head smashing into the weight bench, spinal cord SEVERED. KABLE looks on, impassive, emotion internalized. GUARDS push through.
C: GUARD
D: What the hell happened to this one?
N: An old black dude - LIFER - answers.
C: LIFER
D: Look like he escaped.
N: The GUARDS roll their eyes; drag away the body.
C: GUARD
D: Back to your Jazzercise, girls...
N: Across the room KABLE notices a NEW GUY - a mean-looking sunofabitch... in fact, if murder were personified it would look exactly like HACKMAN. HACKMAN stares straight at KABLE. There is something in his ghost of a smile that says he'd be more than happy to eviscerate you... it's off-putting to say the least.
C: KABLE
D: Freak.
N: FREEK is there.
C: FREEK
D: Tillmans.
C: KABLE
D: Who the hell is that?
C: FREEK
D: New dude, new dude... that's Hackman. They say he killed a whole mess of people, all kind of people... one day he just walk up and turn himself in, like he wanna be inside or some shit... never gonna run out of slayers long as they got that kind of motherfucka run around kill a mess of people...
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 62 CONTINUED: (2) 62 Now HACKMAN is looking at KABLE dead blank. A GUARD comes up behind HACKMAN and SHOVES HIM. HACKMAN turns; the GUARD gestures him to follow.
C: HISPANIC GUARD
D: Hey Kable.
E: O.C.
N: KABLE turns to look.
C: HISPANIC GUARD
D: Let's go. Upgrades.
E: cont'd
T: CUT TO:
S: 63 EXT. PRISON, TRAINING RANGE - NIGHT 63
N: KABLE and the GUARD are ANT-SIZED in what looks like a massive driving range. VIRTUAL TARGETS are holographically projected in mid-air at various heights and distances. Other PRISONERS are there too, a ways off; well out of earshot. KABLE looks over a Swarmer cartridge, slams it into his weapon; switches turrets, takes a bead on a VIRTUAL TARGET... We see him intentionally PAN THE SIGHT OFF to the left of target; he pulls the trigger - CLICK. The TARGET - and several others close by - turns RED, BLINKS - a HIT. This thing doesn't just take out individuals; it takes out VICINITIES.
C: HISPANIC GUARD
D: Who aims?
C: KABLE
D: What?
E: caught off guard
C: HISPANIC GUARD
D: Who aims... the slayer? Or the player?
N: KABLE narrows his eyes, focuses across the field, where other PRISONERS are being briefed and UPGRADED... he spots HACKMAN.
C: KABLE
D: Not much to aiming... it's just hand/eye coordination. I'm the hand... someone, somewhere else is the eye.
C: HISPANIC GUARD
D: That's tripped.
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 63 CONTINUED: 63 KABLE glances at the GUARD... he struggles - part of him feels like he's talking too much; but he can't help being grateful for the human interaction.
C: KABLE
D: Sometimes... they take over - you know, completely. They move you. Like a robot. But it doesn't work so good... that part's just for show. You can't really fight that way.
E: beat
C: HISPANIC GUARD
D: Why?
C: KABLE
D: There's a delay...
C: HISPANIC GUARD
D: Yeah, the ping... they talk about that. The time it takes the slayer to respond to the command... it's like, five millisecond ping, eight millisecond ping...
N: KABLE gets a bead for a headshot on HACKMAN.
C: KABLE
D: Whatever you call it. A slice of a second is the difference between living and dying out there. When the trigger pulls -
N: He pulls the trigger: a meaty CLICK.
C: KABLE
D: It's just me.
E: cont'd
S: 64 INT. PRISON LOCKER ROOM, NIGHT 64
N: KABLE is ALONE, toweling off - privilege of being a TOP SLAYER. We see now the DAMAGE his body has taken - he is covered in dark, ugly BRUISES from BULLET HITS the body armor has absorbed - including a flinch-inducing cluster of BLACK, BLUE AND YELLOW from the most recent session. From down the row of lockers, a WHISPER:
C: HACKMAN
D: Hey. Kable.
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 64 CONTINUED: 64 KABLE turns to look. HACKMAN'S head is POKED OUT sideways from around the corner; he's maybe 20 feet away.
C: KABLE
D: Not interested.
C: HACKMAN
D: No. Wait. Look.
N: He brings his HANDS out where KABLE can see them - they are SLICK WITH FRESH BLOOD.
C: HACKMAN
D: I just deleted someone.
E: CONT'D cont'd
N: HACKMAN is almost GIGGLING, high on it.
C: HACKMAN
D: This is the blood. Look.
E: CONT'D cont'd
N: HACKMAN rubs his SLIPPERY HANDS together, relishing it; he nods his head toward the area behind the lockers... to call the situation CREEPY would be a serious understatement.
C: HACKMAN
D: He's back here. Want to see?
E: cont'd
C: KABLE
D: Your head ain't on straight.
N: HACKMAN cracks his neck. Maybe not. KABLE pulls on his PRISON GREYS quickly, refusing to make EYE CONTACT.
C: HACKMAN
D: I'm going to delete you too. On Sunday.
C: KABLE
D: Yeah, probably.
C: HACKMAN
D: That's why they put me here.
N: KABLE'S eyes narrow - What? HACKMAN disappears; he starts to move along an ADJACENT ROW OF LOCKERS, slamming the doors - SINGING fucking PINOCCHIO:
C: HACKMAN
D: I've got no strings... So I have fun... I'm not tied up to anyone... They've got strings But you can see There are no strings on me...
E: cont'd
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 64 CONTINUED: (2) 64 KABLE tenses up, ready for INSTANT VIOLENCE.
C: HACKMAN
D: You got two whores, Kable...
E: cont'd
N: If he didn't have KABLE'S attention before, THIS GOT IT.
C: KABLE
D: - the fuck did you say?
C: HACKMAN
D: On the outside... oh, I'm sorry - I meant your pretty girls... You want to get back to them but I'm going to visit them first...
N: KABLE is instantly ALL BUSINESS - he's going to make HACKMAN disappear RIGHT THE FUCK NOW... He JAMS around the corner but HACKMAN is NOWHERE TO BE SEEN... past another row of lockers - NOTHING... another... another... WHERE THE HELL IS HE? NOWHERE. KABLE SLAMS a FIST into a locker, BUSTING it off it's hinges.
T: TRANSITION TO:
S: 65 INT. CASTLE ESTATE - TIME INDETERMINATE 65
N: The CAMERA ANGLE on HACKMAN begins to switch perspectives and spin around, as though someone is manipulating it in three dimensions.
C: CASTLE
D: He's so perfect.
N: Snap out to reveal CASTLE in a dark lounge; the walls and ceiling are pure black, making it impossible to tell the dimensions of the room. Minimalist, expensive looking furniture is scattered around. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THE ROOM. CASTLE is standing, bare feet on white shag carpet. He is manipulating the image of HACKMAN in the air by pulling, squeezing, twisting with his hands - the interface is similar to the one in SIMON'S room. CASTLE is as pumped as a kid on Christmas morning. Then, from behind him:
C: CASTLE 2
D: He's scary.
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 65 CONTINUED: 65 We see that a perfect double of CASTLE himself has appeared in the room behind him.
C: CASTLE
D: Yeah...
N: He changes the angle on HACKMAN'S mug to give a better view - then turns to face his DOUBLE...
C: CASTLE
D: The new face of Slayers. Pure crystallized horror, two stories tall and covered in bloody red... He's so what they want.
E: cont'd proudly beat
C: CASTLE 2
D: But they love Kable.
E: playing dumb
N: Another CASTLE appears to CASTLE'S left.
C: CASTLE 3
D: He's right.
N: CASTLE faces them.
C: CASTLE
D: They do now. But when my boy kills their hero right there in front of their eyeballs, so vivid it's like you can reach out and feel the wet flesh - Trust me, they'll change their point of view.
E: unaffected
C: CASTLE 2
D: How can you be sure?
C: CASTLE
D: It's human nature. They'll be seduced by the power, the violence... the dominance...
C: CASTLE 3
D: Guess we never figured on Kable blowing up as big as he did.
E: shaking his head
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 65 CONTINUED: (2) 65
C: CASTLE
D: Bigger than the game? No. Then again, who ever would've imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with the same I-con...
C: CASTLE 2
D: Tillman is a perfect soldier, a tactical killing computer - you dropped him in with common murderers. What did you expect?
C: CASTLE 3
D: His instincts give him an edge.
E: musing
C: CASTLE 2
D: And in the hands of a talented player...
C: CASTLE 3
D: Of course we can never let him out. Not after what we did to him.
C: CASTLE 2
D: Tell me again why we don't just get rid of the problem... You know, off camera?
E: makes a throat slashing motion
N: CASTLE pokes a finger at CASTLE 2.
C: CASTLE
D: YOU - lack a flair for marketing. The people would never accept that. They need to SEE their gladiators brought down.
C: CASTLE 3
D: One thing I know is what makes people tick.
N: Suddenly the room has gone dead silent. We swing the camera around to reveal that CASTLE 3 is all alone in the room. He stares into the void, calm and utterly in control. The CAMERA moves past his head into PURE BLACK...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
S: 66 INT. TUNNEL #2 - DAY 66
N: The black of the underground tunnel... the TUNNEL LIGHTS streak past like vanishing stars... TRAIN TRACKS blur by...
S: 67 INT. TUNNEL #2 - DAY 67
N: KABLE is SPRINTING down the TUNNEL towards DAYLIGHT. The VOICE comes from the rear surrounds:
C: VOICE
D: Kable, dude. It's me.
E: O.S.
N: KABLE shakes his head, thinking he's HEARING THINGS.
C: KABLE
D: Who?
C: SIMON
D: Simon. I'm playing you, dummy.
E: O.S. beat
N: KABLE knifes through the tunnel EXIT...
S: 68 EXT. SPAWN POINT #3 - CONTINUOUS 68
N: We are in the OVER-THE-SHOULDER POV of the FLY CAM as KABLE breaks daylight and slides down the hillside... superimposed over the IMAGE: SIMON'S REFLECTED FACE... the CAMERA pans, centers and FOCUSES IN on the REFLECTION... SNIPER BULLETS whistle by; KABLE DUCKS, ROLLS... the CAMERA PULLS BACK... OUT OF THE SCREEN...
S: 69 INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 69
N: ... past the flesh and blood SIMON into an OVER-THE-SHOULDER - SIMON controlling KABLE, PLAYING HIM - as... KABLE LANDS in the ROCKSTAR POSE. SIMON mirrors him in front of the GIANT SCREEN - whatever SIMON does, KABLE echoes.
S: 70 EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3/COVER - CONTINUOUS 70
N: KABLE makes it to cover, HEART SLAMMING. We hear the distant THUMPS of MORTARS LAUNCHING.
C: KABLE
D: How come I can hear you?
C: SIMON
D: It's a mod.
E: O.S.
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 70 CONTINUED: 70
C: KABLE
D: Gamers can't talk to cons.
C: SIMON
D: I know.
E: O.S.
S: 71 INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 71
N: SIMON POP-LOCKS - the breakdance arm wave.
C: SIMON
D: It's cool, yeah?
S: 72 EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3/COVER - CONTINUOUS 72
N: KABLE finishes the POP-LOCK - it's goofy. A SHELL impacts the dirt nearby and BLOWS A MASSIVE CRATER in the firma; KABLE shields himself from the raining DEBRIS and scrambles for better cover.
C: KABLE
D: No. Pay attention to the game.
N: They spot another BROWN advancing toward a group of BUILDINGS; SIMON moves KABLE to join him. Just as KABLE gets there a BLUE KICKS OUT A DOOR and opens up with an ASSAULT SHOTGUN, shredding the BROWN. Two more BLUES POP OUT of a DITCH on the OPPOSITE SIDE, TRIANGULATING. KABLE ROLLS - BIG AMMO displacing the air just inches above his head and BLOWING OUT the windows/tires of an ABANDONED CAR behind him - switches TURRETS and comes up FIRING... armor-piercing shells: BOOM. BOOM. A 180 spin... BOOM. MINUS three BLUES.
S: 73 INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 73
N: In QUICK CUTS we see SIMON striking BADASS poses; on the 3D screen KABLE ECHOES THEM - it's like a SYNCHRONIZED DANCE.
T: CUT TO:
S: 74 EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3/COVER - CONTINUOUS 74
N: KABLE keeps moving - he passes a BLUE, on his knees in the mud; The BLUE has completely LOST HIS SHIT.
C: BLUE SOLDIER 4
D: This is real, this is real, this is real!!!!
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 74 CONTINUED: 74 KABLE doesn't bother to shoot him; he's UNARMED. But... SHHHTUNK. A 50 CALIBER SHELL connects from somewhere distant and the BLUE is VAPORIZED, a smear on the pavement.
C: SIMON
D: That was sick.
E: O.S.
C: KABLE
D: Wait a minute... are you twelve?
C: SIMON
D: I'm nineteen.
E: O.S.
C: KABLE
D: Bullshit. This is unbelievable. How am I not dead yet?
C: SIMON
D: Cause I'm a badass motherfucker.
E: O.S.
N: KABLE doesn't even register this. His darting eyes pick up a familiar face in the chaos: FREEK. FREEK has apparently volunteered as a generi-con - he is dressed as a postman, pulling a cart of mail behind him as he walks across the street.
C: FREEK
D: Gotta keep my holes down... keep `em down. Freek's gonna make it, gonna cut, gonna scatter... gonna burn this joint...
E: mumbling
N: It all happens too quickly: A BROWN scrambles behind FREEK and ducks down, using him as a moving human shield; squeezes off a few shots - FREEK is chopped up by incoming gunfire - the BROWN keeps running... there's nothing KABLE can do. An explosion nearby pushes them forward.
C: SIMON
D: Gibs.
E: O.S.
C: KABLE
D: What?
C: SIMON
D: Like, giblets. Kibbles and bits. Chunks. Pieces.
E: O.S.
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 74 CONTINUED: (2) 74
C: KABLE
D: These are real humans, fucker.
E: burning
C: SIMON
D: Death row psychos, so what? They had it coming.
E: O.S.
N: An exposed concrete stairwell leads into the bowels of a collapsed building; it looks like it must've gotten the OKLAHOMA CITY treatment in the early 2000s.
S: 75 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING - STAIRWELL 75
N: But there's still juice feeding the dim FLUORESCENTS... KABLE makes his way DOWN. A distant voyeur's POV - maybe a sniper's telescopic sight? - observes KABLE disappearing underground.
C: KABLE
D: Guess that goes for me too.
C: SIMON
D: Yeah, but you're different.
E: O.S.
C: KABLE
D: Different how?
C: SIMON
D: Dude, I don't know. Cause you're MY psycho.
E: O.S.
S: 76 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL - CONTINUOUS 76
N: He emerges in an UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL. Forty or fifty cars and SUVs, 2000-2009, lie dormant, covered in dirt, dust, and debris. KABLE switches on a LIGHT built in to his weapon. The FLY CAM scans 360 degrees, independent of KABLE, giving them two sets of eyes.
C: SIMON
D: Damn, new area.
E: O.S.
N: KABLE nods toward an EXIT at the opposite end, marked P-4.
C: KABLE
D: That way.
N: They make for it. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 76 CONTINUED: 76
C: SIMON
D: Think about it, Kable: all the shit we've been through together. What an epic run. It's going to suck to see it end.
E: O.S. beat
C: KABLE
D: Are you kidding me?
C: SIMON
D: Well, yeah - I get that for you it's different.
S: 77 EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #3/NEAR RESTRICTED AREA - MOMENTS 77
N: LATER KABLE emerges several blocks from where he started, on a narrow block that seems distant from the heat of combat. Buildings shelter the street on either side... several blocks down a LOW WALL BLOCKS THE ROAD - marked with RED DIAGONAL STRIPES and a warning: RESTRICTED.
C: KABLE
D: We should go that way.
C: SIMON
D: There's nothing there.
E: O.S.
C: KABLE
D: Kid, trust me - I was going house to house in Tehran while you were still sucking mommy's nipple.
C: SIMON
D: Uh, yeah dude, thanks for the visual, but it's a restricted area. It's beyond the borders of the game. I couldn't put you there if I tried.
E: O.S. sarcastic
N: KABLE just grunts; his eyes steal a last look down the block. They head the other way... THOOM. CLOSE RANGE: a big ass armor piercing MORTAR SHELL PASSES IN FRONT OF KABLE'S FACE... Time STOPS; KABLE sees the shell moving through the air an inch from his nose in ULTRA SLO-MO... his cheeks ripple from the displaced air... (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 77 CONTINUED: 77 then, REAL TIME - we whip around to follow the mortar as it whistles into concrete and BLOWS OUT the front of a building. KABLE is running.
S: 78 EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3 - CRUSHED RIOT VAN 78
C: SIMON
D: ... shit shit shit!
E: O.S.
N: He rolls behind a CRUSHED RIOT VAN and OPENS UP in the direction the shell came from, ash and debris from the impact still raining down... and then: From behind, he's NAILED IN THE BACK by a SWUNG length of IRON PIPE. He half crumples, spins - HACKMAN. HACKMAN SWINGS AGAIN, knocking the WEAPON out of KABLE'S hand; it skitters across the concrete. SIMON is completely freaked - it's happening too fast, no time to react... he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but every move pings a step late... KABLE swings a fist; HACKMAN dodges easily. HACKMAN is moving too naturally - as if he's under his own control. HACKMAN slams the pipe off the side of KABLE'S head, DROPPING HIM - then tosses the pipe away... and pulls out a nasty, high tech-looking SHOTGUN. He stands over KABLE and points the barrel at his FACE.
C: HACKMAN
D: Bye Kable.
E: friendly
N: He SQUEEZES the TRIGGER... The SUBMARINE ALARM SOUNDS. FLOODLIGHTS CRANK UP. The LEDs on HACKMAN'S gun POWER DOWN with an audible down- cycle... a shell, undetonated, drops from the barrel and plops onto KABLE'S FOREHEAD.
C: HACKMAN
D: What happened?
E: cont'd
T: CUT TO:
S: 79 EXT. SAVE POINT #3 - SIMULTANEOUS 79
N: A BROWN CON walks slowly, on unsteady legs, out of the OCTAGONAL SAVE SHACK - profile... (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 79 CONTINUED: 79 dudes look at him and back away... when he turns toward us we see why: half his head, shoulder and one arm are blown off...
T: CUT BACK TO:
S: 80 EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #3/CRUSHED RIOT VAN - SIMULTANEOUS 80
N: KABLE seizes the opportunity to jam a foot up into HACKMAN'S BALLS, buckling him. He twists HACKMAN'S LEGS into a pretzel and throws him off.
C: KABLE
D: Kid's gonna get me killed.
E: to himself
C: SIMON
D: Hey.
E: O.S. offended
N: KABLE sees GUARDS appearing and BLUES hurrying away from ambush positions - including the one who likely fired the mortar... session complete. KABLE cups a hand over his mouth, conspiratorially, and speaks directly into SIMON'S ear:
C: KABLE
D: Listen to me. I don't know who's behind it, or why, but I was supposed to die today. They're gunning for us. I can beat them, but not with you controlling me.
C: SIMON
D: What the hell...?
N: This is unthinkable, dangerous talk.
C: KABLE
D: Turn me loose, kid. You want to win, turn me loose.
C: SIMON
D: But-
C: KABLE
D: Find a way.
N: A GUARD grabs KABLE and the LINK BREAKS - we... SMASH TO BLACK: WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
S: 81 INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - DAY 81
N: A drab brownstone apartment. Shades block out the oppressive nicotine sunlight; the interior is mute, faded - claustrophobic. KABLE has his cell; even though ANGIE is on the outside, and free, her environment seems to parallel his. A worn-out photo is taped to the fridge: the same little girl in KABLE'S picture.
S: 82 INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM 82
N: She stands in front of a closet mirror in the bedroom, looking herself over. She's FULLY DRESSED... but not like we saw her in society. Conservative. Pretty. NORMAL. She rehearses a friendly smile, but has difficulty not breaking into tears. ANIMATED, COLORED LIGHT leaks in from outside through the dark window blinds behind her - some sort of projected advertising?
S: 83 INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM 83
N: CUT TO: same room, later. ANGIE sits on the unmade bed. She searches through her purse for a PILL JAR, rattles a few into her hand... she DRY SWALLOWS them... leans forward, eyes shut, struggling NOT TO PASS OUT... she has to pull herself together somehow... the CAMERA pushes past her, toward the window, where the ANIMATED COLORS play 24-7...
T: CUT TO:
S: 84 EXT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - DAY 84
N: ... the CAMERA pulls away, continuing the motion: we are on a wide view of the outside of the building, a rundown brownstone on a rundown street - animated advertising covers half the side of the structure... An ad for slayers is running - KABLE, in cinematic slo-mo, and superimposed in wall-height block letters:
C: FREE
D: And then: ORDER NOW!
T: CUT TO:
N: WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
S: 85 INT. SOCIAL SERVICES INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 85
N: ANGIE sits uncomfortably in a hard plastic chair; the light is flat, fluorescent... in front of her, behind a desk, is a no-nonsense Social Services CASEWORKER, late 30s, CUBAN.
C: CASEWORKER
D: So... Miss Roth.
E: looks over her paperwork
N: ANGIE delivers the smile we saw her rehearse with all the warmth she can muster; it's not convincing.
C: CASEWORKER
D: Why are we here today... says you'd like to apply for custody of your child-
E: cont'd
C: ANGIE
D: Delia. Her name is Delia.
N: The CASEWORKER looks over the paperwork while ANGIE shifts in her seat... torture.
C: CASEWORKER
D: Spouse incarcerated, life without possibility of parole. You use your maiden name.
C: ANGIE
D: My husband - he... it's not entirely true, regarding his sentence. In fact, he's due to be released soon...
N: She makes brief eye contact with ANGIE.
C: CASEWORKER
D: Your husband was charged and convicted of first degree murder, Miss Roth. I can hardly consider his release, if it was to occur, to be a positive.
N: This is not going well. ANGIE holds her tongue with all of her will, not wanting to make it worse. The CASEWORKER holds all the cards.
C: CASEWORKER
D: You're... an actor?
E: cont'd changes subject, back at the paperwork
N: ANGIE nods. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 85 CONTINUED: 85

E: cont'd
C: ANGIE
D: I work in society.
C: CASEWORKER
D: Acting, is that what they call it?
C: ANGIE
D: It's a job.
N: ANGIE is hanging on... be pleasant, be friendly, breathe... but INSIDE she wants to cry, to scream, to fucking EXPLODE.
C: CASEWORKER
D: Miss Roth. Your child has been... exceedingly well placed. The new family is very wealthy. She'll never want for anything. I understand you love your little girl, but... do you really think she'd be better off with people like you?
E: leans in
C: ANGIE
D: Yes, I do. I'm her mother.
N: The CASEWORKER presses a buzzer, unlocking the door behind ANGIE.
C: CASEWORKER
D: We will give your application all the consideration that it merits.
N: The words burn into ANGIE like battery acid, but there's not a thing she can say.
S: 86 INT. SIMON'S ROOM - NIGHT 86
N: SIMON is lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling - a GIANT VIDEO SCREEN playing back key moments of that day's Slayers session in an endless loop. SIMON holds his fingers up in front of his face, zooming and rewinding the video with little fluid movements of his hands. Suddenly the screen GLITCHES OUT, goes dead for a second - and when it comes back the battle images are replaced by a GIANT FACE, surrounded by black, STARING DOWN AT HIM: HUMANZ BROTHER, early 30's; a savvy leader with an unforgettable presence. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 86 CONTINUED: 86 His style is a throwback to another era; like a 70s Black Panther Soul Brother transplanted into the high tech future.

D: Software...
E: confused

D: The walkie talkie, playa.

D: That's right, baby. You think about what the brotha said?
C: SIMON
D: To what, um, brotha do you refer... brotha?
C: HUMANZ BROTHER
D: Kable wants the freedom to ass- kick. Do shit his way. You gonna give it to him?
C: SIMON
D: You were listening.
C: HUMANZ BROTHER
D: We see and hear everything that goes on inside the so-called game.
C: SIMON
D: Alright, then. Kable said we got lucky - that they were gunning for us - what was that all about?
E: considering
C: HUMANZ BROTHER
D: Kable got a past... he knows things. Things he don't even know he know.
C: SIMON
D: Huh? What things?
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 86 CONTINUED: (2) 86

D: Things Castle's afraid of. As long as your boy stay on the inside Castle know he can keep him quiet - but if ever got out... Uh uh. Castle will never let that happen.
E: shakes his head
C: SIMON
D: One battle left, I think I can handle my bidness.
N: HUMANZ BROTHER just shakes his head.
C: HUMANZ BROTHER
D: You're not hearing me - this is not something you can control. They gonna kill his ass, Simon. In the eyes of the world. And then what? You just another poor little rich honky. No Kable, no pussy, no shit.
N: SIMON can't deal.
C: SIMON
D: This is, come on... too heavy... I don't know what the hell you're talking about... I just play games, man. Games.
C: HUMANZ BROTHER
D: Mm hm. That's right, it's a game. You want to win it, don't you?
E: changing gears
C: SIMON
D: Yeah, dude, I intend to.
C: HUMANZ BROTHER
D: Then you need to cutcho strings, puppet-massa.
N: HUMANZ BROTHER slowly ZOOMS HIMSELF IN.

E: cont'd
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 86 CONTINUED: (3) 86 SIMON can't help but consider it, mind reeling. It's obvious KABLE would royally fucking dominate, but... SIMON shakes it off.
C: SIMON
D: That... would be cheating.

E: O.S.
C: KABLE
D: How do you know that?
C: WOMAN
D: I know something else: whether or not he's controlling you, you will never reach the save point. Castle won't allow it.
E: O.S.
C: KABLE
D: We'll see.
C: WOMAN
D: No. Listen to me, Tillman - the game is unwinnable - they will not let you live. If you're want to get out and see the people in the picture you'll have to find another way.

C: KABLE
D: Drunk.
T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: 89 INT. STAGING ROOM - TIME INDETERMINATE 89
N: BLACK. Overhead fluorescents shock and hum to life, revealing a CLAUSTROPHOBIC ROOM - four walls, metal grating underfoot - and A LOCKER. KABLE is in his COMBAT BROWN. He PRINT ACTIVATES the locker. The WEAPON is there... and something else: a wrinkled BROWN PAPER BAG. What the hell? He takes it out, trying not to glance too obviously at the overhead SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. CUT TO the POV from the CAM: KABLE is opening the bag...
C: VOICE
D: What's he got there?
E: O.C.
N: BACK in the room. Inside the brown bag is a FIFTH OF VODKA. KABLE quickly slips it into his side cargo-pocket.
C: VOICE
D: Kable, what the hell is that?!
E: cont'd
N: Behind KABLE a DOOR SLIDES OPEN automatically, revealing a CONCRETE TUNNEL, like the PLAYERS' entrance to a FOOTBALL STADIUM... the WHITE LIGHT is BLINKING ON and OFF... SOLDIERS sprint for the daylight, trying to escape the TORTURE... it's CHAOS.
C: VOICE
D: Fuck-face - remove the `molotov' from your pants and discard into the recycle bin, now!

KABLE - no choice - makes the decision, twists the cap, tilts his head back, and SLAMS THE ENTIRE BOTTLE. He wails the BOTTLE at one of the CAMERAS, shattering it - and joins the others rushing into combat.
S: 90 EXT. SPAWN POINT #4 - MOMENTS LATER 90
N: KABLE breaks the DAYLIGHT - but without a smooth LEAP AND ROLL, and no ROCKSTAR POSE - instead, he TRIPS and tumbles ASS OVER END down an embankment, landing in a heap at the bottom.
C: SIMON
D: I can see turning you loose was a great idea.
E: O.S. sarcastic
C: KABLE
D: What happened.
E: woozy
C: SIMON
D: YOU happened, jackass. You wanted control, you got it.
E: O.S.
N: KABLE tests his hands, clenching and unclenching - THE KID WASN'T LYING ... while starting to trip hard on the VODKA, which is kicking in INSTANTLY...
C: KABLE
D: No shit...
C: SIMON
D: Yeah, that's right. So please don't fuck up...
E: O.S.
N: An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE DIRT just a few feet away, BLINDING, DEAFENING - and KABLE shifts into ANOTHER WORLD...
S: 91 EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4 91
N: He's MOVING FAST... SOUND is just an idea, disconnected from reality... BODIES AND BULLETS drift by without gravity... his vision doubles and bleeds...
C: SIMON
D: What's the matter with you Kable? Kill something!

C: SIMON
D: Fuck it.
E: O.S. frustrated
N: We see SIMON'S fingers glide, dial up the SWARMER... KABLE is still firing randomly as the turret shifts - the SWARMER goes STRAIGHT UP, then locks on BLUE and swerves down on them like HELL FROM THE SKY, turning skulls to swiss cheese. Too close.
C: SIMON
D: Kable. Listen: it's the last game. You're going to be dead and I'm going to look like a total asshole if you don't pull your balls together!

S: 93 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL - MOMENTS LATER 93
N: KABLE slams open a door marked P4 and stumbles into the CAR GRAVEYARD... Reality is ROARING, SPINNING... KABLE slams into the side of a parked car, legs rubber... he looks it over - TIRES FLAT, NO GOOD... he stumbles to the next, then another... another... his head hits a passenger side window, SPIDERWEBBING IT... (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 93 CONTINUED: 93 FINALLY, the ONE: A FORD F-250 SUPER CHIEF... GUN METAL GREY, PRISTINE. Note: the F-250 is a CONCEPT TRUCK - a future design for FORD'S F-line. In our world this is a 2009 factory model, which makes it old, but not antique. The truck is about as BADASS as you could want, with dark, narrow windows, big ass wheels and a FRONT END that looks like it could PUNCH THROUGH A BUILDING OR TWO. KABLE gets to the FUEL CAP DOOR and pries it open... ENGRAVED under the cap is a prominent WARNING: Ethanol Only
C: SIMON
D: Kable. Dude. What are you doing?
E: O.S.
N: KABLE unscrews the cap and sticks his finger down his throat. Dry heave. He does it again - this time puts his mouth on the hole and PUKES PURE LIQUID INTO THE TANK.
C: SIMON
D: What the hell?
E: O.S. cont'd
N: He stops, doubled over, gasping for breath... then the feeling hits him again - and he heaves another fountain down the hole. A BLUE shows up in the opposite stairwell - KABLE brings his WEAPON up to hip level and BLOWS HIM AWAY WITHOUT LOOKING. His head is clearing. KABLE looks around, unzips his pants and PISSES INTO THE TANK. SIMON is slack-jawed, speechless. KABLE shakes out his head; we can see in his eyes that he's regaining his senses; focusing in. He busts out the DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW, gets in; tears open the steering column - A BLUE SLAYER shows up in the mirror - fuck! - He CRANKS THE IGNITION... VRUUUUMM, KACHUNK, KACHUNK... BOOOM! A 50mm SHATTERS the back window and punches a hole into the dashboard. KABLE checks what's left of the mirror. HACKMAN and six other BLUE SLAYERS are coming fast.
C: SIMON
D: GO, GO, GO!
E: O.S. cont'd
C: KABLE
D: Yeah? Anything else ya fuckin cheerleader?
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 93 CONTINUED: (2) 93 VRUUUUUM, VRUUUM... KABLE hammers on the pedal again, knocking out the old ghosts - VRROOOOOOMM!! He SLAMS it into gear and PEELS OUT. HACKMAN leaps onto the side of the moving truck and points 50mm directly at the side of KABLE'S head. In a split instant KABLE grabs the nose of the weapon and points it up - BOOM! A close range shell blows through the roof of the truck. KABLE slams the brakes, spinning the truck, and launches HACKMAN into a row of parked cars. HACKMAN gets in one last shot as KABLE punches it out of the garage, disintegrating a concrete column.
C: HACKMAN
D: Fuuuuck!!!!
N: He slams his head into the windshield of a parked car, caving it in.
S: 94 EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4/F250 (DRIVING) - MOMENTS LATER 94
N: KABLE DRIFTS the F-250 onto the street, sideways, tires shrieking... wiping out two unlucky BLUES... pops it and TAKES OFF... He is headed STRAIGHT INTO THE RESTRICTED AREA.
S: 95 INT/EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4/F250 (DRIVING) 95
N: The FLY CAM is right there, taking the hot turn right on the truck's tail, giving SIMON the POV of a classic 3D DRIVING GAME. He activates DYNAMIC CAMERA CONTROL with a gesture - now he can manually choose his view... he pushes the CAMERA forward, next to the driver's window... The CAMERA looks to the side at KABLE, driving like he's on a mission to HELL. SIMON barks in his head.
C: SIMON
D: Kable, PLEASE... get back in the game! YOU'RE SCREWING MY ASS, KABLE!!!
E: O.S.
N: KABLE ignores him; he picks up his WEAPON, points it out the window at the FLY and FIRES... the FLY jukes out of the way, barely... it spins off OUT OF CONTROL and SMASHES through the window of a building. Bye, FLY.

N: A LOW CONCRETE WALL surrounds the perimeter, and it's COMING UP FAST; beyond it: more abandoned urban wasteland. KABLE has got too much speed at this point to do anything but slam the thing SIDEWAYS into a SICK POWER SLIDE - the TRUCK hits the barrier and FLIPS OVER IT, CORKSCREWING four times before GRINDING TO A STOP on it's hood. The AIRBAGS DEPLOY, smashing KABLE into his seat...

N: A DARK, underground VIDEO ARCADE... low ceilings, concrete; OLD SCHOOL - sort of a graveyard of lost games... the classics of the 80s - MISSILE COMMAND, DEFENDER, ROBOTRON, CRANK, etc. The dimensions of the room are impossible to determine. A dozen or so PEOPLE - just BLACK SILHOUETTES in the CATHODE RAY GLOW - are scattered around, banging buttons, giving it body english, racking up scores. TRACE leads KABLE through, toward the one BRIGHTLY LIT SPOT: at the center of the arcade, an AIR HOCKEY table is blasted with WHITE LIGHT from above. HUMANZ BROTHER, who we recognize from SIMON'S vid screen, and HUMANZ DUDE - mid 20s, long hair - are playing: CLACKCLACK, CLICK, CLACKCLUNK, CLACK... They are so wrapped up in their game that they don't appear to notice KABLE. HUMANZ BROTHER smacks a random 3-bank WINNER.

One SITS. We only see them from behind, not their faces; SIMON nods waddup. The SEATED MAN pushes several PHOTOS across the table to SIMON. SIMON glances at the top photo as casually as he can manage - it shows SIMON in an MTV TRL-type setting, being interviewed in front of a live audience of teenage girls.

A TAXI speeds by with FOUR PEOPLE crushed in the back seat having CRAZY ANIMAL SEX. ANGIE starts walking. She passes a FAMILIAR FACE, who turns to watch her go, without expression - is that GINA PARKER SMITH? ANGIE walks around the corner to a BAR and goes in.
S: 121 INT. THORAX BAR - CONTINUOUS 121
N: The THORAX BAR is small, intimate, but ULTRA-STYLED... the theme is insect. All manner of exotic bug preserved in glass, suspended in ice... one wall is a giant, black-lit ANT FARM... green, glowing FIREFLIES dart through the air... people lounge on plush seating, gobbling up creatively prepared bug delicacies - FRIED PINK GRASSHOPPERS, fat yellow GRUBS with red chili oil... ANGIE takes a seat at the BAR.
C: BARTENDER
D: The usual?
N: She just WINKS, flirtatious. The BARTENDER returns a smile and shakes up an AQUA BLUE MARTINI... to finish, he plops in a LIVE, WHITE LARVA... (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 121 CONTINUED: 121 it curls and twists in the liquid, soaking the alcohol into it's pulp... She takes a SIP, letting the LARVA curl around her tongue... swallows it down... as a GUY takes a seat to her left - his hair is shiny, slick black licorice.
C: RICK RAPE
D: Hi Nika.
C: ANGIE
D: Oh. Hi. Rick Rape, right?
N: In GORGE'S apartment his lips move, ANGIE'S echoing to match.
C: ANGIE
D: I thought you weren't allowed to come here anymore.
E: cont'd
N: RICK RAPE laughs, throwing his head back and slapping his knee - EXAGGERATED.
C: RICK RAPE
D: That was just last month. I was a bad boy.
N: ANGIE yawns.
C: ANGIE
D: Are you still a bad boy?
S: 122 INT. ANGIE'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY 122
N: ANGIE EXITS the ELEVATOR on the 3rd floor - a modern, minimalist building... RICK RAPE is with her, close behind. They come to an apartment door; RICK RAPE pushes her, from behind, up against the door - VIOLENT... her right hand SLAPS a PALM IDENTIFICATION SENSOR alongside the door and it WHISPERS OPEN. ANGIE snaps a heel; they stumble in.
S: 123 INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 123
N: ANGIE'S place is some kind of overdecorated, SCHITZOPHRENIC blend of GIRLIE/GEEKY/PORN. Shafts of NICOTINE SUNLIGHT filter through patterned curtains. She crawls along a plush WHITE FUR RUG... RICK RAPE follows... he licks his lips - an automatic gesture - and begins to UNBUTTON HIS PANTS. ANGIE, on her hands and knees, back to him, doesn't even bother to look, until...

C: RICK RAPE
D: Urkk.
N: She TURNS. KABLE has RICK RAPE up in the air, holding him like a BARBELL - with one hand CRUSHING HIS THROAT, the other his BALLS. He brings him down over his knee, SNAPPING HIM like a BROKEN BAT - KKRRUNCH. ANGIE'S FACE is passive, neutral... but her EYES are NUCLEAR with EMOTION. KABLE tosses RICK RAPE'S broken body into the bedroom... then falls to his knees in front of ANGIE and takes her face in his palms, gently - EYES LOCKED INTO HERS. GORGE is paralyzed.
C: GORGE/ANGIE
D: Please don't kill me.
N: ANGIE says the words, but they don't match her eyes. KABLE just shakes his head, trying to grasp the situation.
C: GORGE/ANGIE
D: I'll do anything.
E: cont'd

D: Don't say that.

D: I love you too.

S: 124 INT. ANGIE'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY 124
N: KABLE pulls ANGIE out the door and down the hall, in tactical mode, WEAPON ready... he heads to the ELEVATOR, punches up a ride. No sign of trouble.
C: KABLE
D: I'm going to take you someplace where they can turn it off... the program...
E: quiet
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 124 CONTINUED: 124 GORGE/ANGIE says NOTHING. The ELEVATOR DOOR whispers open - HACKMAN is standing there with an ASSAULT SHOTGUN.
C: HACKMAN
D: Hi, Kable.
E: friendly
N: BOOM. KABLE TAKES IT IN THE CHEST; he's BLOWN OFF HIS FEET, through a wall and into an apartment opposite the ELEVATOR. HACKMAN grabs ANGIE'S wrist, drags her onto the ELEVATOR and waits a BEAT, smiling pleasantly. The ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSES.
S: 125 INT. APARTMENT - DAY 125
N: KABLE is ON HIS BACK in rubble. His chest is a BLACK, SMOKING HOLE... but as the smoke clears we see that his BODY ARMOR has ABSORBED THE BLAST. He's groggy, in excruciating pain, wind knocked out of him - but ALIVE. TWO GUYS in GAS MASKS and RUBBER SUITS are watching him from the next room as he attempts to STRUGGLE TO HIS KNEES; KABLE has obviously interrupted something.
S: 126 INT. ELEVATOR - SIMULTANEOUS 126
N: HACKMAN and ANGIE are having a pleasant ride down, HACKMAN'S hands folded in front of him, patiently; the SHOTGUN - still smoking - shoulder strapped.
C: HACKMAN
D: Anybody in there?
E: to ANGIE
N: The ELEVATOR stops and picks up TWO PASSENGERS: a GIGGLING, NECKING COUPLE. The doors CLOSE. HACKMAN gives GORGE/ANGIE a wink and flashes a NINE INCH BOWIE KNIFE, carbon steel, nasty. ANGIE'S eyes go wide with TERROR. The COUPLE is oblivious. GORGE can't hold back, the SICK FUCK; he squirms in his chair, sweating buckets, feeling himself up. And when he speaks, ANGIE echoes:
C: GORGE/ANGIE
D: Come on... do it...
N: HACKMAN raises his eyebrows - he wasn't expecting that one... but he OBLIGES. A flex of his shoulder; the NECKING GIRL'S legs buckle under her and she goes down without a peep. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 126 CONTINUED: 126 The GUY is confused - where'd she go? He looks to ANGIE. HACKMAN headlocks him from behind, and slowly - making eye contact with GORGE/ANGIE the entire time - SNAPS HIS NECK. ANGIE'S eyes stream tears; GORGE is in ECSTASY. HACKMAN lets the second body DROP, chuckling, as the ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS... KABLE is waiting.
S: 127 INT. ANGIE'S BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 127
N: KABLE grabs HACKMAN with both hands, RIPS HIM OUT OF THE ELEVATOR and SLAMS HIM into a WALL. A BRUTAL HEAD-BUTT to the FACE, smashing bone... ANOTHER. HACKMAN'S FACE erupts with BLOOD. HACKMAN SWINGS BLIND with the BOWIE KNIFE, once, twice - the blade misses KABLE, backpedaling, by fractions of inches; displacing some SERIOUS AIR... HACKMAN lets it FLY. The BOWIE whistles past KABLE'S FACE and THUNKS into the wall behind him, four inches deep. HACKMAN smears the BLOOD from his eyes and brings up the SHOTGUN, but KABLE is quick - instead of trying to move away, HE STEPS IN, pushing the barrel STRAIGHT DOWN as HACKMAN FIRES. The BIG HIT puts a CRATER in the floor and takes out a set of HACKMAN'S toes. KABLE kicks the SHOTGUN from HACKMAN'S hands and brings up his own WEAPON to close the deal... ... as the GLASS WALLS of the LOBBY EXPLODE. MORE SLAYERS are MOVING IN. KABLE releases a barrage of cover fire, grabs ANGIE and breaks for the BACK EXIT.
S: 128 EXT. SOCIETY - DAY 128
N: KABLE and ANGIE hit WHITE HOT DAYLIGHT. A BLUE SLAYER breaks the corner of the building and KABLE FRAGS HIM. KABLE grabs ANGIE by the shoulders and yells directly at GORGE:
C: KABLE
D: YOU! WHERE THE HELL DO WE GO?
N: CONTINUOUS SHOT: GORGE/ANGIE starts running across the street, leading the way; (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 128 CONTINUED: 128 KABLE takes out another BLUE at a distance, following close behind her. They run into a GENERIC, UNMARKED BUILDING...

S: 131 INT. UNDERGROUND RAVE - CONTINUOUS 131
N: ... a 24 HOUR UNDERGROUND RAVE, in full effect. This thing is FUCKING HUGE... in the DARK it's impossible to tell just how big... hundreds of writhing SOCIETY DUDES, CHICKS and OTHER... DAY-GLO, moving spotlights, strobes... the BUBBLE GIRLS from CRANK make an appearance... along with the DISCOVERY CHANNEL SKATERS from the PARK, now in GOTHED-UP GEAR... KABLE gathers it all... he takes ANGIE'S arm and begins to wade through the CHAOS... the BLOOD SPATTERS on his face POP in sharp, inverse DAY-GLO, like HARTIGAN'S SCAR in SIN CITY... A SKATER GIRL takes a hold of the glowing, smoking barrel of KABLE'S WEAPON and starts to SKATE CIRCLES around him, ring- around-the-rosie... he wrenches it hard, sending her flying into a crowd that goes down like BOWLING PINS. They continue MOVING... KABLE happens to notice RED LASERS moving through the DARK... probing... RAVE LIGHTS? No... THOOM. THOOM THOOM. LIGHTNING FLASHES, EXPLOSIONS... a RAVER nearby disintegrates, BLOOD and GUTS a DAY GLO VOLCANO. DANCERS slip and FALL ON THEIR ASSES in the viscera. The SLAYERS are moving thru the RAVE, hunting. Everyone but KABLE and ANGIE are so out of it they don't even notice.
C: KABLE
D: You. Run.
E: to GORGE
N: ANGIE runs. KABLE goes COMMANDO, evading the HUNTERS, ducking under EXPLODING SHIT... he moves to FLANK them... (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 131 CONTINUED: 131 the DJ is DECAPITATED by a stray 50 caliber round but the GROOVE DON'T STOP... LIGHTNING STRIKES FREEZE the ACTION as KABLE engages the BLUES, one by one... he takes out THREE of them with CLOSE RANGE BLASTS and another HAND-TO-HAND-TO-HEADSNAP - then notices more BLUES moving in... too many... He catches up to ANGIE and they make for an EXIT, any EXIT...
S: 132 INT. RAVE - LOUNGE AREA 132
N: They find CURTAINS, run past freaky CHILL LOUNGES and SMOKE OUT ROOMS... KABLE blows a hole in a locked maintenance door and they duck out of RAVE WORLD into...
S: 133 INT. RAVE - INDUSTRIAL CONCRETE CORRIDOR 133
N: ...an industrial CONCRETE CORRIDOR... MUFFLED BLASTS, SCREAMING in the REAR SURROUNDS tell KABLE the BLUES are close behind... up more stairs, they SLAM through a SERVICE DOOR and back into...
S: 134 EXT. SOCIETY - DAY, CONTINUOUS 134
N: ... blinding DAYLIGHT. A SCOOBY DOO-looking VAN pulls up to the CURB in front of them; the back doors SWING OPEN.

D: I can get you out.
N: Not much choice. KABLE and ANGIE climb in. The ELECTRIC VAN drives quietly away, attracting no attention.
S: 135 INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS 135
N: KABLE slumps against the wall of the VAN, cradling ANGIE in his arms - exhausted. ANGIE'S eyes are POST-TRAUMATIC, searching. GINA is PUMPED.

N: CLOSE-UP: a LANCET is prepared... it PUNCTURES SKIN and SUCKS. ANGIE is lying on a black leather couch, unconscious - breathing deeply... TRACE pops the LANCET out of ANGIE'S fingertip and plops a RED DROP into a glass tube of liquid. KABLE kneels beside ANGIE, stroking her hair. HUMANZ DUDE, HUMANZ BROTHER and GINA PARKER SMITH are all there.
C: KABLE
D: Now what?
C: HUMANZ DUDE
D: The crack works - you're the proof... we put the DNA in the soup, light it up, extract it - then feed my girl's sequence into the code and we're good to go.
E: shrugs
C: GINA PARKER SMITH
D: It's an anti-spyware program.
E: thinking out loud

D: Nine weeks later Scotch was dead and you were serving life in maximum. Castle's project was shut down... but the shit wasn't a total loss: the same technology resurfaced within a year... in a game. Castle called it society.

He looks around the DARK ROOM nervously; takes a hit of OXYGEN. On the SCREEN, society is gone - there is only a nebulous TEST PATTERN. Behind him, a SOUND.
C: GORGE
D: Hooz there?
N: He runs his hand along the CHAIR'S TRACKBALL CONTROL, it SPINS around and rolls forward a bit. CASTLE'S GEEK SQUAD is standing in the room, silhouettes in the dark - scary.

We begin to make out a coherent image: It is a POV, walking, of an industrial corridor. Cameras mounted and doors with square glass windows. We back away from the screen to reveal - HUMANZ DUDE, HUMANZ BROTHER and GINA PARKER SMITH are watching the image on a LO-FI computer monitor. HUMANZ DUDE runs his fingers along a touchpad, MOVING FREQUENCIES around on a WAVEFORM MONITOR, trying to dial the picture in better. We see KABLE through an OBSERVATION WINDOW, slumped over in a chair... DREAMING? Or just CONCENTRATING?

D: Cool.
C: AGENT KEITH
D: Yeah, ain't it? Looks like someone up the chain decided you're no longer a threat.
E: sarcastic
T: CUT TO:
S: 153 INT. SIMON'S ROOM - TIME INDETERMINATE 153
N: SIMON slides open the door to his room, peaks inside hesitantly. It's TRASHED. The FLOOR is littered with busted up electronics and garbage. The wall-sized screens are all running the same thing - a SINGLE WORD, repeated in columns, by the thousands - scrolling fast, a digital waterfall of words, white on black: CHEATER It's over. SIMON sits down in the middle of the detritus, in a state of mild SHOCK - he's LOST EVERYTHING. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 153 CONTINUED: 153 He gestures at the screen and closes out the SCROLLING LOOP... then once again, attempting to activate SLAYERS control; the screen shows the same nebulous TEST PATTERN we last saw on GORGE'S screen.
C: FEMALE VOICE
D: No link... no link.
N: SIMON slumps against the wall, DEFEATED.
T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: 154 EXT. CASTLE ESTATE - NIGHT 154
N: CASTLE'S ESTATE is like a DESERTED CITY. Balconies, underlit DOMES, lush landscaping, abstract statues, waterfalls... tiny cameras everywhere... and not a soul in sight. KABLE drops over a wall and onto grass. Wind in the leaves, cricket music - otherwise DEAD SILENCE. He keeps to the trees, making his way toward the central MANSION. THEN: the sound of DOGS... they come in a PACK, loping across the lawn - grey, more like WOLVES... KABLE readies his gun to take them out - but the DOGS run RIGHT PAST HIM. They round a corner and DISAPPEAR. Weird. KABLE looks up, spots a CAMERA... and another, and another... stands to reason he's been MARKED already. He walks out INTO THE OPEN.
S: 155 INT. CASTLE'S MANSION - NIGHT 155
N: The GIANT FRONT DOORS of the MANSION are OPEN. KABLE walks right in. The interior is HUGE... and EMPTY. NO FURNITURE, no art; no people of course. Could anyone possibly live here? He explores...
S: 156 INT. CASTLE'S MANSION - EMPTY HALL - NIGHT 156
N: AND THEN - at the FAR END of a large, empty HALL: A LITTLE GIRL, 5 - is sitting on the floor by herself, playing with DOLLS, making them walk and talk. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 156 CONTINUED: 156 KABLE'S eyes go wide. He starts to walk toward her, slowly at first...
C: KABLE
D: Delia...
N: ... and finally breaking into a run - until: He SLAMS into what seems to be an INVISIBLE WALL, crumpling to the ground. The GIRL doesn't react. KABLE pounds on the glass...
C: KABLE
D: DELIA!
E: cont'd
N: ... then looks closer, running his fingers across the SMOOTH SURFACE.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: Not bad for video, eh?
E: O.S.
N: The VOICE comes from UNSEEN SPEAKERS; it seems to be everywhere at once, intimate.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: The latest and greatest... defy you to tell it from real life. You imagine porn on this thing?
E: O.S. cont'd
N: KABLE wants to EXPLODE - but he contains himself. He's playing CASTLE'S GAME, and the RULES are still UNDEFINED. Then - MUSIC: The SOUND of a SWINGIN' HI-HAT from down a long corridor - t - t - tssss, t - t - tssss, t - t - tsss... KABLE walks toward the source; a bass and piano pick up the groove.
S: 157 INT. CASTLE'S MANSION, BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 157
N: He comes to a BALLROOM - empty, like everything else; shiny hardwood floor for DANCING. A SPOTLIGHT pops on from above, illuminating KEN CASTLE. He's wearing a T-SHIRT and JEANS. Every instinct tells KABLE to go after him - but he holds back. Who knows if it's even real? And then CASTLE starts to SING... ... or more precisely, LIP SYNC - the VOICE is SINATRA, I've Got You Under My Skin... CASTLE is doing a spot-on KARAOKE: I've got you under my skin (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 157 CONTINUED: 157 I've got you deep in the heart of me So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me I've got you under my skin... He's snapping his fingers, putting on the moves... THEN - from behind curtains - a half dozen SLAYERS appear. We RECOGNIZE THE SCARRED, BATTLE-TOUGH FACES from the prison, the game, the pursuit... only instead of BLUE, they are wearing TUXEDOES with BLUE BOW-TIES. KABLE grips his weapon, but the men are UNARMED; instead, they fall in on the beat and go into a CHOREOGRAPHED DANCE behind CASTLE... I'd sacrifice anything come what might For the sake of having you near In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night And repeats, and repeats in my ear... KABLE notices SHADOWY FIGURES around the perimeter of the room... glasses, beards, pony tails - silently, the GEEK SQUAD has moved in and taken position. They move their hands in rhythm, synchronized... each one seems to control a DANCER: they TWIRL A FINGER and the SLAYER SPINS... kick with TWO FINGERS FOR LEGS and the SLAYER KICKS like a ROCKETTE. Suddenly, ON A MUSICAL HIT, everyone - CASTLE, the GEEKS, the SLAYERS - points dramatically up at the wall, where a VIDEO SCREEN BEGINS TO PLAY: it is footage of the GEEK SQUAD busting into humanz headquarters and EFFICIENTLY KILLING EVERYONE. ANGIE is tasered unconscious and dragged away. Don't you know, little fool, you never can win? Use your mentality, wake up to reality... But each time I do just the thought of you makes me STOP -
C: before I give in
D: Cause I've got you, under my skin...
N: KABLE hits his breaking point. He brings up his WEAPON to open up on the SLAYERS... CLICK. It's DEAD. The GEEKS have taken care of that. KABLE tosses it aside and sprints for CASTLE, but the SLAYERS break off from the choreography to ENGAGE HIM; turns out they're flesh and blood after all. CASTLE backs away, whistling the melody, and continues his SOFTSHOE to the music as KABLE wades into brutal hand-to-hand combat... breaking necks, snapping arms, smashing faces... it's a full-on BALLET OF DEATH... finally, THE MUSIC ENDS, right on cue: KABLE is finishing off the last of the men, blood on his hands. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 157 CONTINUED: (2) 157 CASTLE applauds; the GEEKS follow suit.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: You're awesome.
E: genuinely stoked
C: KABLE
D: Castle.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: Kable.
N: They speak simultaneously:
C: KABLE KEN CASTLE
D: I don't care about you. You don't care about me.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: ... you just want your little sugar pie, I know. So don't do anything stupido. My house, my rules.
E: cont'd
N: CASTLE walks away, leaving his back open to KABLE seemingly without concern, toward a side door.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: Come on, I want to show you something.
E: cont'd
S: 158 INT. CASTLE'S MANSION, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 158
N: Tracking along the hallway, MEDIUM CLOSE, profile: CASTLE walks along, confidently, KABLE following. The background is a black, glittering STARSCAPE.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: I've got to thank you for leading me to them, by the by - the human- zuzz that is...
N: Snap out WIDE: the hallway seems to run along the SURFACE OF THE MOON - another 3-D projection, no doubt. CRATERS and LUNAR DEBRIS stretch to the horizon. The GEEK SQUAD walks along behind CASTLE and KABLE at a distance... they are all tiny MOON ANTS in the vast lunar panorama... the PLANET EARTH rising majestically in the dark heavens.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: Of course, soon enough they'd be whistling my tune like everybody else... but meantime it was that little cracker program they dreamed up that got my attention...
E: cont'd MORE CONTINUED
N: WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
C: 158 CONTINUED: 158 KEN CASTLE
D: that was a genuine nuisance, no doubt about it... One thing even they didn't know, though: I'm wired too.
E: cont'd
N: SNAP back to CASTLE, MEDIUM CLOSE. His eyes are FUCKING CRAZY.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: I replaced 98% of my own noodle with nano-tissue years ago...
E: cont'd
S: 159 INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS 159
N: They leave the hallway and step on to an indoor, NBA regulation BASKETBALL COURT; electronic scoreboard, bleachers, the whole nine. It's dark, moody - only one bank of OVERHEAD FLOODS is turned on. At the FAR END of the COURT, HACKMAN is in WARM-UPS, shooting baskets. ONE leg - the one with the ABBREVIATED TOES - is in a FLEX BRACE. The GEEK SQUAD grabs seats in the BLEACHERS.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: But mine's different. Built to send - to transmit . Whereas every other K-soft cell out there - including the ones in... your head, Kable - is designed to receive. I think it, you do it.
E: taps his FOREHEAD taps KABLE'S forehead 
N: CASTLE looks across the court at HACKMAN; nods toward him... HACKMAN drops the ball and begins to POP LOCK.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: We're talking every Slayer, everyone in Society City... I believe your better half would fall under that category... provided they're within range of my transmitters...
E: cont'd
N: CASTLE chuckles at HACKMAN; HACKMAN stops dancing, jogs over, picks up the ball and resumes shooting.
C: KABLE
D: Very nice, Castle. So you've got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you.
E: sarcastic
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 159 CONTINUED: 159 CASTLE narrows his eyes, amusement edging out irritation; he walks over to a bin of GRIP POWDER.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: You're thinking small, Kable. But not as small as me.
N: He sinks his hands into the POWDER, brings them out and CLAPS, making WHITE DUST CLOUDS. KABLE waves the dust AWAY FROM HIS FACE.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: See, nano cells are real small, a thousand times smaller than even these dust particulates... Inhale it and they go to work: replicating, spreading... like a virus, multiplying in exponentials... six months time I could have 100 million people converted - ditch diggers, porn stars, presidents - and not one would be the wiser.
E: cont'd KABLE coughs
N: Behind KABLE, HACKMAN lets the ball roll away and silently TURNS TOWARD US.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: A hundred million folks that will buy what I want them to buy, vote how I want them to vote, do pretty much damn well anything I figure they ought to do.
E: cont'd
N: HACKMAN comes running at KABLE from behind, eyes burning, at a full charge... running into FOCUS... holding the BOWIE KNIFE...
C: KEN CASTLE
D: For instance.
E: cont'd
N: KABLE hears HACKMAN at the last second, spins and ABSORBS THE TACKLE. The men GO TO THE GROUND, grappling, UFC-style. KABLE has HACKMAN'S KNIFE HAND by the wrist, stopping it - but leaving his face UNPROTECTED... HACKMAN brings his free ELBOW down on KABLE'S face, connecting and opening a CUT under his eye; then AGAIN - this time KABLE catches the elbow with his own free hand and WRENCHES IT IN SIDEWAYS, dislocating HACKMAN'S shoulder with a sickening POP. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 159 CONTINUED: (2) 159 KABLE works around HACKMAN, gets him in a HEADLOCK and SQUEEZES... still gripping the knife hand, immobilizing it... HACKMAN is choking, BEAT RED... for long, brutal seconds the life drains out of him... finally, HACKMAN'S eyes roll back; he GOES LIMP. KABLE takes the BOWIE KNIFE from HACKMAN'S dead fingers. He struggles to his feet, dripping sweat and blood.
C: KABLE
D: You should've let him fight for himself, Castle - he might've had a shot.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: I think you're missing the point, my man.
E: pleasant
C: KABLE
D: No, I get it - you're pulling the strings on all of this... (starts to move toward
C: CASTLE with BAD INTENT)
D: ... which makes my next move pretty easy to figure.
N: KABLE comes at CASTLE FAST, bringing the KNIFE around to open his throat like a PEZ DISPENSER... His arm FREEZES IN MID AIR, the BLADE inches from contact.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: Neglected to mention: my smart boys reversed that hack those fellas worked for you - easy breezy, once we had access to their drives...
N: This is gut-wrenching for KABLE -- after tasting freedom, he feels his will ripped away from him... HE'S BEING PUPPETED BY THE MAN HE HATES THE MOST.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: You're mine, boy.
E: cont'd
N: With a twitch of CASTLE'S eyes KABLE brings the KNIFE down and SLICES OPEN HIS OWN LEG.
T: CUT TO:
S: 160 INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 160
N: SIMON is sitting on the floor, head hung low, in front of the dead wall... a glitch, a flicker... the screen comes to life: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 160 CONTINUED: 160 It's KABLE'S POV of KEN CASTLE. CASTLE is stripping off his shirt.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: Come on, lets boogie woogie rock and roll.
E: on SCREEN
C: SIMON
D: Ummm.
T: CUT BACK TO:
S: 161 INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS 161
N: CASTLE throws a funky KARATE KICK and nails KABLE in the jaw... then a haymaker to the GUT, doubling KABLE over. He lets KABLE swing the KNIFE just short of his face as he backs away.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: Biggest, baddest Slayer in the game... don't seem like much, does he?
N: CASTLE is enjoying the hell out of himself. He uppercuts KABLE, snapping his head back... then shakes out his knuckles.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: Oww!
E: cont'd
N: KABLE swings his OPEN HAND around - CASTLE choreographs it perfectly: KABLE'S nails rake across CASTLE'S STOMACH, MARKING HIM UP like BRUCE LEE in Enter The Dragon. CASTLE strikes a pose to match.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: Lucky shot. OK, not really.
E: cont'd grins
N: He brings a passable REVERSE CRESCENT KICK that drops KABLE to the floor.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: I need an audience, boys.
E: cont'd
N: A DOOR OPENS at the far end of the court; KABLE looks up slowly, afraid of what he knows he'll see: ANGIE and DELIA are led into the room. ANGIE presses herself * close to DELIA, holding her shoulders protectively. * (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 161 CONTINUED: 161 She keeps her distance from the GEEK SQUAD escorts and tries * to block DELIA from them - there is raw fear and anger in her * eyes; the GEEK SQUAD are not overtly violent or menacing, but * ANGIE seems acutely aware that they are lethal. DELIA seems * oddly neutral and unaffected by the entire situation. * CASTLE kicks KABLE across the floor, toward them.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: That's right, you crawl on your belly like a toad... (he looks to the GEEK
E: cont'd
C: SQUAD, sheepish)
D: Is this bad? I'm really bad.
N: He gives KABLE a last kick; KABLE collapses in front of his DAUGHTER... she looks down at him, curiously. * He looks up at DELIA, eyes soaked with emotion... then to * ANGIE. They share a moment of intense eye contact - we feel * that ANGIE wants desperately to go to him but is unsure of * what is the best action to take strategically; she is looking * to KABLE for a clue. * KABLE'S eyes go back to DELIA; he tries to reach up and * gently touch her face...
C: KEN CASTLE
D: That's sweet.
E: cont'd
N: CASTLE steps on KABLE'S hand, pinning it to the floor.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: Alright boys, you ready? A true test.
E: cont'd
N: He steels his eyes on KABLE and concentrates. KABLE slowly brings up the KNIFE toward DELIA'S THROAT. ANGIE moves to pull DELIA away - CASTLE merely glances up at * her and she FREEZES, paralyzed. We can see her body strain * against invisible control, raw panic in her eyes... *
C: KABLE
D: No.
E: desperate
C: KEN CASTLE
D: Just like last time. Remember?
N: KABLE is FIGHTING IT with all his will, his whole body shaking... (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 161 CONTINUED: (2) 161
C: KEN CASTLE
D: You're stronger now... a little more fight in you... but I think the end result will be about the same... *
E: cont'd
C: KEN CASTLE
D: Shh.
E: cont'd
N: The GEEKS look on, impassive. The BLADE is inches away... He * looks into ANGIE'S eyes - she and KABLE are like one; he * seems to draw strength from her... finally, KABLE WILLS * EVERYTHING HE HAS and STABS THE KNIFE INTO THE FLOORBOARDS. * Suddenly: KABLE's head SNAPS around, his eyes confused... and in one quick, smooth movement, KABLE YANKS THE KNIFE out of the floor, RISES TO HIS FEET AND SPINS ON CASTLE. He claps a hand around CASTLE'S neck and tries to jam the knife up into his GUT - but CASTLE is able to FREEZE HIM just short...
C: KEN CASTLE
D: What the hell was that?
E: cont'd freaked
N: The GEEKS break out tiny devices and start quickly scanning. Not even KABLE understands this.
C: PONYTAIL GEEK
D: There are 2 networks accessing the same IP address.
C: GEEK LEADER
D: Someone on the outside is sending him commands...
T: CUT TO:
S: 162 INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 162
N: SIMON is on his feet, in full BADASS GAMER MODE. His body is positioned exactly like KABLE'S - right hand gripping the virtual blade for an underhand thrust; left hand clutching CASTLE'S THROAT... he FORCES HIS RIGHT HAND FORWARD...
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007
S: 163 INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS 163
N: ... KABLE'S KNIFE HAND begins to inch forward. Now CASTLE is the one struggling for control; he claws weakly at KABLE'S hand, trying to loosen it off his neck...
C: KEN CASTLE
D: JAM THE SIGNAL YOU GOD DAMN RETARDS!
E: panicking
C: GEEK
D: Working on it...
E: irritated
N: KABLE'S eyes are locked in on CASTLE'S... straining with everything he has... his strength and will overpowering CASTLE, but-
C: KEN CASTLE
D: I think it.
E: like he's explaining the obvious to a child
N: KABLE, succumbing to CASTLE'S control, begins to move the knife away from CASTLE'S belly.
C: KEN CASTLE
D: You... fucking... do it...
E: cont'd
N: CASTLE delivers a CRUNCHING HEADBUTT to his NOSE, KABLE loses his footing, sweat pouring down his face, bloody, drained... CASTLE pushes the KNIFE back towards KABLE. He fights back - every muscle in his arm fighting against another like Yin & Yang, veins rising in his neck... Then KABLE senses an opportunity:
C: KABLE
D: Look at this knife... imagine me sticking it into your gut... think about it... make it real.
N: CASTLE laughs... BUT HIS EYES FLICKER TO THE KNIFE - of course he can't help but picture it... ... and in that instant KABLE JAMS IN THE BLADE...
C: GEEK LEADER
D: Oops.
E: blank
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 163 CONTINUED: 163 ... CASTLE focuses, trying to pull it back out, but KABLE shoves it in deeper - CASTLE'S EYES BULGE. Finally KABLE TWISTS the KNIFE and lifts CASTLE OFF THE GROUND. The paralysis breaks from ANGIE - she lunges forward to throw * her arms around her daughter. *
S: 164 INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 164
C: SIMON
D: YES!!!
E: triumphant
N: He drops down into the badass, ROCKSTAR pose...
S: 165 INT. CASTLE'S COURT - SIMULTANEOUS 165
N: ... and KABLE does the same. *
C: KABLE
D: Damn it, kid...
N: CASTLE collapses to his knees in front of KABLE, glass-eyed, draining life... they are FACE to FACE.
C: KABLE
D: ... is the fuckin pose really necessary?
E: cont'd
N: CASTLE face-plants on the COURT.
C: SIMON
D: Sorry.
N: KABLE'S body relaxes; he tosses the knife across the floor... then turns to face his family. When DELIA finally speaks there is a trace of CASTLE'S Georgia peach accent.
C: DELIA
D: Are you my Daddy Tillman?
N: He gathers DELIA in his arms and lifts her off her feet, squeezing her close; she SQUEEZES BACK. KABLE grabs ANGIE with his other arm and pulls her in. The GEEKS look at one another - realize that their employment contract with CASTLE has just been terminated... shrug; pocket their shit, zip up their backpacks and fanny packs, get up and start to file out.
C: KABLE
D: Wait.
N: (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 165 CONTINUED: 165 GEEK LEADER stops.

C: TRACE
D: This is for you, you dumb bitch. I hope you do the right thing with it.
N: The IMAGE switches to the CAPTURED FOOTAGE of KABLE in the military facility... leading up to SCOTCH'S murder. The light from the screen reflects on GINA PARKER SMITH'S face - she's wide-eyed, stunned. (CONTINUED) WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 166 CONTINUED: 166

S: 167 INT. KABLE'S CAR - DAY 167
N: SHOOTING STARS fly past us in the dark... the SAME IMAGE WE STARTED WITH... only instead of an underground train carrying SOLDIERS to battle... The TUNNEL ENDS; we break from the side of a mountain into BLUE SKY AND SUNLIGHT. KABLE is driving on the open highway... ANGIE is in the passenger seat, asleep, head pressed up against the window glass. KABLE checks the rear view window; makes eye contact with DELIA, who is suspended in a lightweight car seat in the back seat.
C: KABLE
D: You good, sweetheart?
N: DELIA nods. KABLE allows himself a smile, puts his eyes back on the road. ANGIE slowly reaches for KABLE'S hand, she rubs her thumb on his tattoo - "I am right here with you" - and falls back asleep. The CAMERA tilts up, stares out the front window and moves into the giant sun. SMASH TO BLACK. THE END
