M: PROLOGUE
N: Stagnant black water ... Greasy. Pitch. Thick. Oily. Dense. Heavy... Lapping... Slow.... A desolate canal... Night. Onto dark stones... rain-slicked... darkest slate-grey cobbles... And on through streets... Narrow. Grimy. Sooty. Rank... Deserted... Pastal-disused Victorian broken-windowed, derelict buildings and wharf side warehouses with rotten oaky loading beams and rusted iron chains... Mossy, mildewed walls... Dripping fetid water from corroded dilapidated ancient ruined guttering... Moving... Turning... Into a pinched, arched, alleyway -- If anything darker, blacker... Foreboding... Forsaken... And if we listen -- If we strain our ears -- listen -- we can hear music -- faint. Ghostly. Haunting ... "Take Me Back To Dear Ol' Blighty " as if sung by a jolly girl in a long gone bar surrounded by drunken men... We keep moving... The music growing... In the distance a faint glow.... Dirty-yellow, diffused, misty light... We move towards it... Towards the piss-coloured light... We stop... In the middle of nowhere... Dark nowhere... and the music fades... Fades away... Vanished... Extreme silence... All we have is all we can see... The gable end of an old house.... Limey-light bleeding weakly from a broken, filthy window... All is still -- suddenly it comes crashing down -- the end wall comes crashing down - a flurry of bricks and mortar... Crashing down... The tumble of masonry... And through clouds of brick-dust and rubble we see figures inside... Through a smokey powdered fog we can see a group of men in the downstairs room of the derelict house... On the walls faded 40's wallpaper, peeling in parts to reveal older dim patterns... damp patches... A window crudely boarded up... A few unmatched armchairs in various states of disrepair -- a 60's black vinyl, a deco-patterned smoker, a 70's cream plastic, a brown wooden kitchen chair etc... The colours in the room are browns, greys, caramels, darks, muted... In the middle of the room, standing on dusty, bare wooden floorboards, his fist clenched aggressively by his sides, is OLD MAN PEANUT, aged 80... Skinny... Wearing a dark three piece suit... Gold watch chain... Black Homburg... He is squaring up to us... Staring... CONTINUED: (2) Slightly behind, to his left, sitting nonchalantly cross- legged in a battered brown leather wingback armchair and casually smoking a Davidoff cigarette, is MEREDITH, late 40's... Suave... Immaculate... Wearing black handmade boots, black Saville Row suit, black cashmere roll neck sweater, herring bone overcoat with a black velvet collar, brown leather gloves, his jet-black hair is heavily brilliantined.... Behind him an old wardrobe... Standing with his back three quarters to us, and leaning on a broken, chipped, mantelpiece over a smashed tiled fireplace is ARCHIE, aged 52... Big... Avuncular... Wearing a car coat and casual nondescript clothes... he is pouring himself a Captain Morgan's rum from a bottle into a polystyrene cup... He sort of sees us -- is not fussed -- drinks... Standing at the back of the room, in front of a door which * has at some time been on fire, (it's yellowing, tobacco-ey paint charred and blistered), is MAL, aged mid-40's... Wearing a silver-grey suit, white shirt, duck-egg blue silk tie... There is another man in the room but we do not see his face -- for he s its slu mpe d, h ead in his han ds in o ne of t he armchairs - a picture of despair. He wears an olive green shirt, brown trousers, maroon braces... This is COLIN, aged late 40's...
T: CUT TO
N: Blackness and silence... In the silent black an outsize boot appears - scuffed and tatty... Attached to skinny legs in black tights... The legs gangle and flip pulling into view a bony, pasty, bare torso which is undulating oddly -- and here comes the head! - Long, lank, shoulder length hair... Dripping from a white domed pate - The face poker straight in contrast to the comedic body- antics -- A grave-grey face -- Fleshy, bulbous, rubbery... Ladies and Gentlemen -- MAX WALL! He goon-walks about for a bit in the black space... Baboon- bottomed... As if knees tied together... Aflickin' and akickin' his clown boots... His unhappy face... Like death... Prancing... Ridiculous dancing... Absurd... Giant C/U on his morose contorted phizzog...

S: 1 INT LIVING ROOM DETACHED SUBURBAN VILLA NIGHT 1 *
N: MUSIC... `WITHOUT YOU' by NILSSON... We are out of focus on purple... white... scattered sparkling "jewels"? begin to come into focus and we see that they are in fact pieces of broken glass... Thousands of splinters and shards strewn across a purple Wilton carpet... the white fur of a luxurious sheepskin rug in bits... Ripped to shreds... In extreme C/U we begin to move along the floor slowly taking in mor e de bri s of d est ru ct io n... Sm as he d c ha ir s... Sm as he d photographs... Broken records... Ripped, shredded record sleeves -- `THE POWER OF LOVE' by JENNIFER RUSH -- `HOPELESSLY DEVOTED TO YOU' by OLIVIA NEWTON JOHN -- `I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU' by WHITNEY HOUSTON etc. The TV remote smashed to smithereens... The television -- widescreen -- TOTALLED!... We move along the plush `World of Leather' leather sofa... See that a chunk has been bitten out of it... See teeth marks -- like a bite out of cheese!... Moving on past an area of slashed carpet and underfelt... Approaching the legs of a si deboard and see ing into the bla ckness underneath... We can just make out the quizzical, frightened eyes of a white poodle... We move on... Past twisted, wrecked lampshades... Broken plates, ornaments... An up-ended vase of half-eaten flowers... NILSSON continues his self-pitying overwrought ballad and as he hits the massive, masochistic chorus/crescendo we come across COLIN lying rigid on his back in the corner of the devastated room... His shocked eyes staring wildly... His body petrified. Paralysed... As if frozen at the height of an epileptic fit -- Like something from Pompeii -- Like Max Schrek as Nosferatu hit by light... We stay on COLIN... His uncomprehending terror-filled eyes... His sheer rigor mortis-like horror... We move in on him... Into the black of his eyes... The tragic, agonised black..

N: We are outside, square on to an upstairs window of a detached suburban villa... We hear muffled sounds from inside the house... Yells... Screaming... Cries... Commotion... And suddenly the glass window explodes towards us as a desperate terrified woman comes crashing through... Having run full pelt to escape from something... This is LIZ, aged 44...

E: Gently
N: We now see ARCHIE sitting in a nearby armchair, smoking, patient...
C: ARCHIE
D: ... C'mon mate, you can't lie `ere forever!
N: The rigid COLIN, ignoring him, has suddenly, belatedly, realised that the music has stopped... Desperately needing his friend, NILSSON -- like a man in excruciating pain reaching for a gallon of morphine, he frantically, urgently twists his body on the floor and reaching behind, hammers the play button on the nearby ghetto blaster... And slowly, gently, kindly, the piano intro of NILSSON'S gorgeous wallow re- commences... Colin, somewhat soothed, eases back into his former rigid, mortified position.

N: But COLIN is sobbing... quietly sobbing... sobbing his heart out... ARCHIE looks in the rear view mirror at MAL... Who in turn looks to MEREDITH who calmly smokes raising an eyebrow... Now the van swings into a cul-de-sac, headlights illuminating a row of tatty garages and picking out OLD MAN PEANUT who stands there stony-faced... MAL opens the rear door...

D: Two years later I was dead... I passed away in the small hours in a nursing `ome in Slough, with a drip in me arm, me gnashers in a mug by the bed and me boots most definitely on!... I'd done me hip in the spring and couldn't cope with meself no more at `ome, if you must know... I died in a `orrible fuckin' room they'd give me in the midst of a bunch of doddery, decrepit, dribbling old mongs!... Come the time, this dragon-witch-bitch of a nurse, arsked me if I wanted a fuckin' priest?! To make my peace!... I arsk you!!... I told `em where to get off!... Told `em all to fuck off out of it and leave me to meet my maker on my Jack Todd!... I lay on my pit like a scabby * baby and waited for it... waited for it... waited for it to come... and get me! It came alright... The Reaper came, alright... in the middle of the fucking night -- Like a burglar -- Like a worry... I opened my milky mince's and saw... saw Death... The ugly brute of it... It's black mouth... it's cocky eyes... `ungry like the wolf... for me!... My time was up! I was wanted!... "I'll break you", it said... "I'll fucking' break you!"... I stared at it... hissed at it... spat at it... I raised myself up from the stainy cot with my weak, bony arm... got myself in a proud position -- my spine ramrod straight... It was reaching for me... grabbing at me... laughing at me... "FUCK YOU!", I said... `FUUUCCKK YOOUU!!!!!"
