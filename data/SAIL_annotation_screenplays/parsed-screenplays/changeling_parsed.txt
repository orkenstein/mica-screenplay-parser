S: EXT. COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN
N: A small, pleasant house on a tree-lined street in Los Angeles circa 1928. 210 North Avenue 23. Not far from Dodger Stadium. SUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES, MARCH 9, 1928.
S: INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN
N: A Bakelite alarm clock hits 6:30 A.M. and RINGS. CHRISTINE COLLINS, thirties, attractive, rumpled, reaches INTO FRAME to shut it off. She sits up, rubs tiredly at her face, and moves OS, switching on a radio as she goes. Music fills the air.
S: INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: She throws water on her face as the music continues. She looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead. She hits the wall offhandedly, something she does every day. The flickering stops. With a last look at the mirror, she smoothes back her hair and exits, switching off the light.
S: INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - LATER
N: Dressed now, she flicks on the overhead light. WALTER COLLINS is nine years old, with light brown hair, though we don't see much of it or him, he's entangled in the sheets. It's important that we don't see him too clearly in most of the following scenes, but without drawing attention to that aspect.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Walter...time for school, honey.
N: She sits on the edge of the bed, runs a hand through his hair.

D: You can sleep in all you want tomorrow, that's what Saturdays are for. Now hurry up or your breakfast will get cold.
E: Cont'd
C: WALTER
D: It's cereal, it's supposed to be cold.
N: She smiles, kisses him on the forehead, and exits. He sits on the edge of the bed, wavers, then falls back into bed again.
S: EXT. PASADENA AVENUE - MORNING
N: A street-car (known then as the Big Red) rumbles down the street in the gray light of morning, passing Ford Model A's and Hudsons and Nash four-door sedans.
S: INT. STREET-CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Christine sits on one of the benches, Walter's face buried in her lap, still half-asleep. She nudges him as they come to an intersection by a grade school. It's early enough that only a few other kids have arrived.
C: CHRISTINE
D: We're here, sweetie. Come on.
N: She hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward the door. She watches from the curb as he heads toward the school. Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as Walter approaches, so she knows they're aware that he's there. She waves, then hurriedly gets back on the street-car as it rumbles away.
S: INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY
N: Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard room is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy wooden headsets...a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once. Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator to another as needed. Christine is one of them. She turns at the SOUND of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Okay Sandy, what's the prob--
N: The mortified operator hands her the headset and stalks off. CHANGELING A True Story 3.
C: OPERATOR
D: You deal with this one, I'm not going near it.
N: Christine struggles on the headset.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Hello? Yes, this is the supervisor, ma'am, what can I -- Yes, I can see that you're on a party line, ma'am, what can I -- I know, it's unfortunate, but people sometimes do listen in on party lines. We hope to have private lines installed by -- Well, what's he doing when you're on the phone? Are you sure? Maybe there's a problem with the phone line. He could be asthmatic, or -- Oh.

No, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about people abusing the equipment or... themselves. I'm sorry. I --

C: MR. HARRIS
D: Tell them to take the plug and shove it in and out a few times, that'll usually do it.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Unfortunately that was part of the problem. If you'll excuse me....
N: She roller-skates off toward another operator waving another pink sheet of paper. CHANGELING A True Story 4.
S: EXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - LUNCH AREA - DAY
N: Christine sits alone, eating a bag lunch and reading a thick telephone company manual. Working hard to advance herself. Then a bell rings: time to return to work. Other employees gather up their belongings and start inside. As Christine closes the book, her bookmark falls out. As she picks it up, we see that it's a child's drawing: her and Walter (with arrows indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun. She touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again. She grabs her belongs and heads back inside.
S: EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON
N: Christine waits outside the school as another bell rings, announcing the end of classes. Kids run outside, Walter among them. He folds in alongside as they start down the sidewalk.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Hey, sport.
C: WALTER
D: Hey, mom.
C: CHRISTINE
D: So how was school?
C: WALTER
D: Okay. We learned about dinosaurs, and I got in a fight with Billy Mankowski.
C: CHRISTINE
D: What happened?
C: WALTER
D: He hit me.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Did you hit him back? Good. Rule number one: Never start a fight, but always finish it. So why did he hit you?
E: he nods
C: WALTER
D: Because I hit him.
N: She stops, looks at him.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Wait...you hit him first? Why?
E: he nods
N: CHANGELING A True Story 5.
C: WALTER
D: He said my dad ran off because he didn't like me.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Your dad never even had a chance to meet you...so how could he not like you?
C: WALTER
D: Then why did he leave?
N: Christine takes his hand, and they continue down the sidewalk.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Well, the same day you were born, something else arrived. It came in the mail, in a box just slightly bigger than you. You know what was in that box? Something called responsibility. Now, to some people, responsibility is fun, it's what you live your whole life for. Other people think it's the scariest thing in the world.
E: he shakes head
C: WALTER
D: So he ran away because he was scared of what was in the box?
C: CHRISTINE
D: Yup.
C: WALTER
D: That's dumb.
C: CHRISTINE
D: That's what I thought.
N: She turns and crouches down in front of him.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Walter, I decided a long time ago that I would always tell you the truth, that I would treat you like a grown-up. I can't expect you to respect me unless I respect you. I've never lied to you. Your father leaving had nothing to do with you, and everything to do with what was in the responsibility box.

D: First one to the corner store gets ice cream!
N: He laughs and tears off. She runs after him, letting him stay ahead of her the whole way.
S: EXT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Walter is asleep on the floor, in front of the radio, which is playing the closing moments of Amos and Andy. Christine enters and turns off the radio. He stirs, looks up at her.
C: WALTER
D: Did I miss Amos and Andy?
C: CHRISTINE
D: I'm afraid so, sport. Come on now, time for bed.
N: She picks him up and carries him up the stairs.
C: WALTER
D: Are we still going to the movies tomorrow?
C: CHRISTINE
D: Uh-huh. I hear there's a new Charlie Chaplin playing down at Grauman's, and a new serial called The Mysterious Airman.
C: WALTER
D: Who's that?
C: CHRISTINE
D: I don't know. Nobody does. That's what makes him so mysterious.
C: WALTER
D: Oh. Am I too heavy for you to carry?
C: CHRISTINE
D: Not for years yet, Walter. Not for years.

D: Hello? Oh, hello, Margaret. I'm fine, thanks. No, I was just -- You're kidding. When did she call in sick? What about Myrna? I know she could use the extra hours. Oh. No, it's just...I promised Walter I'd take him to the movies today. There has to be somebody else.... All right, I...guess we can do it tomorrow. I'll get there as soon as I can.

C: CHRISTINE
D: There's a sandwich and milk in the icebox, and I've asked Mrs. Riley if her daughter can stop by in a couple of hours, just to --
C: WALTER
D: I can take care of myself.

N: If the place was hectic before, now it's even worse: lines buzzing, voices chattering, operators following Christine around with papers and question.
C: OPERATORS
D: We've got lines jammed from here to Ohio...he insists on talking to someone in charge...I've tried everything and the console's just dead...I need your signature here for a supply requisition....

C: MR. HARRIS
D: Christine...good, I was hoping to catch you. I've been following your work reports, and I just want you to know that I'm very impressed.
N: She glances down the block. The street car is approaching, but she doesn't want to piss off her boss by running off.

S: EXT. STREET - EARLY EVENING
N: She passes a grocery store, where a clock reads 6:15, and continues past other houses on the pleasant, green street. We HEAR parents telling their kids to come in for dinner, radios playing music or radio dramas. Peaceful, charming. Christine smiles, turns the corner, looks to her house -- -- and it's dark, closed up. No lights on inside, no music or dramas on the radio. Dead silent. Christine pauses, then picks up her pace. No need to panic, he could be upstairs asleep, could be in the back of the house, where the lights wouldn't show. She goes to the front door. It's unlocked. She enters --

D: Walter...? Walter.... She starts walking again. Faster now. Looking around trees and porches, anywhere a nine-year-old boy might hide. She hears children playing. Laughing. She picks up her pace, homing in on the sound.
N: She turns the corner to find three children playing, none of them Walter. She looks down the ominously empty streets. Her worry growing, she heads to the house. Faster now. Heels clicking on the hard sidewalk.

Every day the needs of honest citizens are put second to greed and personal gain. Every day, the city sinks deeper into a cesspool of fear, intimidation and corruption. Once the City of Angels, Los Angeles is now a place where our protectors have become our brutalizers...where to be the law...is to be above the law...where none dare speak truth to power.

One operator holds up a pink request sheet. Christine starts toward her, but then the operator glances to another supervisor and hands it off. Knowing she has to do something about this, she turns to the room and, in a firm, clear voice, says:
C: CHRISTINE
D: Excuse me, can I have your attention?
N: The room grows quiet. Everyone is looking at her.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Listen, everyone, I appreciate your consideration, but I'm not made of porcelain. I won't break down and cry if the station to station call to Kankakee doesn't go through. Actually, I...promised myself that I wouldn't cry...wouldn't let myself cry...until I knew, one way or another, what.... Point is...I like the noise here.

She slows, unable to look away, a growing dread settling in her heart. Harris points out the window. Points...to her. The police captain nods and enters the switchboard room. As Jones heads for her, the strength goes out of Christine's legs. She holds onto the a desk as he stops before her. CHANGELING A True Story 20.

C: JONES
D: My name is Captain J. J. Jones, Lincoln Park Juvenile Division. My office supervises all runaway and missing child cases, including your son's, and.... He's alive, Mrs. Collins. He was picked up two days ago by local police in De Kalb, Illinois. He's safe and unhurt. He was in the company of some drifter, we've got an APB out for him now, and --

N: But she hasn't heard anything past he's safe and unhurt. She almost goes to the floor as other women rush toward her, crying and embracing her.

D: Yours is a story with a happy ending, Mrs. Collins. People love happy endings. Train should be pulling in shortly. We'd better get a move on.

C: "WALTER"
D: Did you know that Los Angeles is where they make the Tom Mix movies?

N: We HEAR the same train whistle from this side as Christine and Jones come to the ramp, POLICE CHIEF DAVIS is waiting. The reporters are held back at the entrance to the platform.
C: JONES
D: Mrs. Collins, I'd like to introduce you to Chief of Police James E. Davis.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Oh, my, I didn't expect --

D: I take it you've been treated well by my boys in the department?

D: Women. Just a sec....
N: He trots off to catch up with Christine, who walks alongside the train, looking from window to window, anxious, eager. Then: the Matron gets off the train, her frame momentarily blocking the view of the boy beside her...but Christine spots them. With Jones not far behind, she breaks into a run.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Walter...Walter!
N: She runs toward them. The matron turns, sees her, smiles and gets out of the way, revealing the boy. Christine stops. Staggers so hard she almost falls. She steps forward slowly, a hand going to her mouth. For a moment, we're not sure what's going through her mind. She looks to the matron, who smiles. Looks to the boy, who smiles. Then she steps back a pace, horror sinking in as Jones comes jauntily alongside her. CHANGELING A True Story 23.

N: And he RUNS to her, grabbing her around the waist, which only magnifies her horror. Jones has no idea what to make of her, or this, or the boy. The only thing he knows is that the chief of police is standing right over there, smiling now that he thinks he's seen a mother and child reunion. The press is nearly insane trying to get through to them.
C: JONES
D: Mrs. Collins...listen to me. I know you're feeling uncertain right now, but that's to be expected...a boy this age changes so fast...but we've compensated for that in our investigation. We're experts in child identification. There's no question that this is your son.

D: It's not Walter.
C: JONES
D: It's not Walter as you remember him. That's why it's important for you to take him home, on a...trial basis.

D: A trial basis?
C: JONES
D: Once you've put him back in familiar surroundings, and given yourself time to recover from the shock of his changed condition...you'll see that it is him. I swear to you, Mrs. Collins. I give you my word. Trust me...this is your son.
N: She looks from him to the boy...who is not terribly dissimilar from Walter...so that even the audience may not be entirely sure if it's him or not...and part of her wants desperately to believe...the pressure is immense.

N: Without giving her a moment to reconsider, he waves and the Chief of Police approaches as the press rushes toward them. In an instant, they're overwhelmed by people shouting questions, flashbulbs popping, a fever of excitement.

D: How does it feel to have your son home, Mrs. Collins? What did you think when you saw him for the first time?

N: -- the car door SLAMS and she and the boy sit side by side. The silence is in profound contrast to the madness of a moment earlier. An officer gets in they drive off, passing Jones and the Chief of Police, talking quietly off to one side. Christine looks to the boy. He smiles at her.
S: INT. COLLINS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: The only noise is the clock on the wall, ticking. Christine sits at one end of the table, "Walter" at the other. Studying him. He is finishing a sandwich, not meeting her gaze.

D: I'm not running away from anything, least of all my responsibilities. I'm even taking care of that boy because right now I'm all he has. What worries me is that you've stopped looking for Walter.
C: JONES
D: Why should we look someone we've already found?
C: CHRISTINE
D: But you haven't found him. He's still out there somewhere, lost, maybe hurt....

D: Mrs. Collins? Dr. Earl W. Tarr. Captain Jones sent me. I consult with him from time to time on juvenile cases. May I come in?
C: CHRISTINE
D: Oh...yes, of course.
N: She steps aside, and Dr. Tarr enters, looking around.

D: Thank you for coming. I'm surprised Captain Jones moved so quickly. I was starting to think he didn't believe me.
C: DR. TARR
D: Well, I'm here now, and we'll put all that to rights. Where is the boy?
N: He looks up as "Walter" comes downstairs. Noting that he said "the boy," not "your son," Christine looks relieved.
C: DR. TARR
D: Ah! There he is. A handsome young man. He has your eyes, doesn't he? And a little bit of the nose. Very fit, in spite of all his travails. A very resilient boy you've got here, Mrs. Collins. As he bends down to look more closely at "Walter," Christine stiffens...she can't have heard that right.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Doctor Tarr, I thought you were here to help me.
C: DR. TARR
D: I am. Captain Jones said the boy had gone through some extreme physical changes, and asked me to look in on him...to reassure you in this your time of motherly concern.

C: DR. TARR
D: Ah, well...hardly a mystery, Mrs. Collins. We've known for some time that trauma can affect the growth of children. Given the stress of the last four months his spine may have actually shrunk. It's uncommon, but within the realm of possibility.
C: CHRISTINE
D: What about the circumcision?
C: DR. TARR
D: Very likely his abductor thought it appropriate. After all, circumcision is hygienically sound. Must have been quite traumatic at the time. No wonder he's submerged the memory.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Look, doctor --
C: DR. TARR
D: As you can see, there's a perfectly sound medical explanation for all of this. But it's good for you to raise these questions. You should be apprised of all changes the lad went through during his absence.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Wouldn't I know whether or not he was my son? I'm his mother.
C: DR. TARR
D: Which means you're in no position to be objective. You are looking through the prism of extreme emotion at a boy who has changed from what you remember. He isn't the same boy that left here, just as a boy who goes off to war and returns isn't the same anymore.

N: He looks from one child to the other. They don't reply. Either they don't recognize him, or they're intimidated.
C: DR. TARR
D: Now, now, no need to be afraid. Surely you knew Walter, and played with him? So which of you can identify Walter for me, for his mother, and for the police? This officer would want you to do the right thing as good young citizens.
N: The kids exchange a glance. It's clear they don't recognize the boy, but they're intimidated by the presence of Tarr and the police officer. A few reluctantly raise their hands. Another of them goes to "Walter," who is shorter than he is. CHANGELING A True Story 33.

N: Gordon Northcott makes his way to the ticket booth.
C: GORDON
D: I'd like a ticket to Canada. Alberta or Vancouver, whatever's leaving tonight.
C: TICKET VENDER
D: Don't have anything going that far tonight. Best I can do is put you on a train for Seattle. From there you can transfer to one of the locals or drive across the border.
C: GORDON
D: That'll be fine.
C: TICKET VENDER
D: Round-trip?
C: GORDON
D: One way.
N: The vender moves away to pull the ticket. Gordon glances at a cop heading his way. Stiffens. The cop continues past him. Gordon relaxes as the vender slides the ticket across.

D: That'll be fifteen dollars.

N: Just enough to establish the transition.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
N: Christine is on top of the bed, eyes open, not having slept all night. She's staring at the woman on the next cot. THe woman is staring back at her. The second-hand on a clock behind protective chicken-wire passes 8:00 and a loud BELL goes off, announcing the start of the day. We hear doors being unlocked up and down the hall. Christine stands, pulls her hair back, and catches her reflection in the window: pale, drawn, smudged, and in a hospital gown... looking like someone who actually belongs in this place. The door opens and she steps into the hall as a NURSE passes.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Can I see the doctor? Or someone in charge --
C: NURSE
D: Breakfast is half an hour.
C: CHRISTINE
D: But I --
C: NURSE
D: Down the hall. The doctor will call for you when he's ready. Go or stay, either way I lock the door.
E: beat
N: Christine doesn't want to stay, so she moves off.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - DINING AREA - MORNING
N: Christine and the other patients sit at long tables. A few talk in quiet whispers, but most eat silently, staring vacantly ahead. Some have scars showing lobotomies or electro- convulsive (shock) therapy. It's a scary bunch. Christine isn't eating. Another female patient, CAROL DEXTER, thirties, watches Christine then slides closer. A BEAT, then:
C: CAROL DEXTER
D: You should eat. Eating is normal. You got to do everything you can to look normal. That's the only chance you've got. Besides, you'll need the strength.
N: CHANGELING A True Story 60. Christine is startled by the level-headedness of the advice from someone she assumed was probably nuts. Reluctantly, she begins eating the cold-looking oatmeal.
C: CAROL DEXTER
D: My name's Carol Dexter. What's yours?
C: CHRISTINE
D: Christine. Christine Collins.
N: Christine reacts to the taste of the food, which is awful.
C: CAROL DEXTER
D: Finish it all. I know it's hard, but you have to try. Lunch isn't as bad. Close, but not as --
C: CHRISTINE
D: I won't be here that long. As soon as I can talk to a doctor, they'll realize there's been a terrible mistake and --
C: CAROL DEXTER
D: Yeah, that always works. I heard them talking. You're here on a code twelve, police action. The doctors, the staff, they figure that if the police sent you here, there must be a good reason for it.
E: beat, quieter
C: CHRISTINE
D: Then I'll just have to prove that I'm not insane.
C: CAROL DEXTER
D: Yeah? How? The more you try to act sane, the crazier you start to look. If you smile too much, you're delusional or stifling hysteria. If you don't smile, you're depressed. If you're neutral you're emotionally withdrawn and potentially catatonic.
C: CHRISTINE
D: You seem to have given this a great deal of thought.
C: CAROL DEXTER
D: I have. Don't you get it? You're code twelve. So am I. We're here for the same reason. We pissed off the cops.

N: CHANGELING A True Story 61. Christine sits back heavily, starting to understand the world more than she ever wanted to.
C: CAROL DEXTER
D: What, you thought you were the only one? The lady over there was married to a cop who kept beating her up. When she tried to tell somebody, they sent her here. And that one? The police beat the crap out of her brother, broke both his arms. When she complained to the papers, they picked her up and...

D: I...work nights. I mean, I work nights. Downtown. In some of the clubs. You know.
E: Chris doesn't get it
N: It gets through. Hooker. Christine nods.
C: CAROL DEXTER
D: This one client started hitting me, and he wouldn't stop. So I filed a complaint. Turns out he was a cop. Next thing I know, I'm here.
C: CHRISTINE
D: But how can they --
C: CAROL DEXTER
D: You're kidding right? Hey, everybody knows women are fragile, right? They're all emotions, no logic, nothin' goin' on upstairs. And sometimes, like when they say something that's a little, y'know, inconvenient...they just go fucking nuts, pardon my French. If we're insane, nobody has to listen to us. I mean, who are you going to believe, some crazy woman trying to destroy the integrity of the force, or a police officer? Then once they get us in here, we either learn to behave, and shut up, or -- Or you don't go home...or you go home like that.
E: beat
N: CHANGELING A True Story 62. She nods to an older woman whose upper temples are marred by surgical scars. Lobotomized. Christine turns away.

D: Better finish up your oatmeal. Want to look sane for the doctors. Then I want to hear what they nailed you for.
N: Numb with horror, Christine forces down the oatmeal.
S: INT. JUVENILE DETENTION HALL - DAY
N: Sanford Clark sits near several other juveniles being held. Pensive, nervous, he watches a kid absently tapping a ruler against his knees. FEATURE the ruler. Rising. Falling. Tapping. Then back -- -- on Sanford as we hear it continuing to tap OS. PUSH IN ON his face. Then, suddenly -- FLASHBACK -- on a HATCHET, rising and falling in tune with the ruler tapping. There's blood on the hatchet. Gordon Northcott's eyes glitter insanely as he brings the hatchet down again and just as it comes right AT US we flash -- BACK TO SCENE As Sanford CRIES OUT with the memory. We PULL BACK to see the others in the room staring at him. He turns away, won't meet their gaze. Something's terribly wrong. Just then, an ADMINISTRATOR comes in.
C: ADMINISTRATOR
D: Clark...Sanford Clark.
N: Sanford rises, goes to the Administrator.
C: ADMINISTRATOR
D: Paperwork's come through. You'll be deported back to Canada day after tomorrow. The police there will to decide what to do with you next. I hope your stay here has convinced you not to try crossing the border illegally in future.
N: He starts to turn and walk away when: CHANGELING A True Story 63.
C: SANFORD
D: Wait, I...I want to talk to the officer who brought me in.
C: ADMINISTRATOR
D: I'm sure he has far more important things to do than --
C: SANFORD
D: Please. It's important.
N: The Administrator senses that he's sincere, and troubled.
C: ADMINISTRATOR
D: He's off-duty until tomorrow, but... I'll see what I can do. No promises.
N: And with that, the administrator heads away.
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON
N: Gordon Northcott is hitch-hiking by the side of the road. A truck approaches, passes him...then slows and stops. Gordon runs up to the truck as the DRIVER leans out.
C: DRIVER
D: How far you going?
C: GORDON
D: Vancouver.
C: DRIVER
D: Hop in.
N: Gordon climbs into the truck and goes to shove his bag under the seat...when something metallic bangs underneath. He lifts out a short length of metal pipe.
C: DRIVER
D: Don't worry about that, pal. Just a little insurance. A couple of guys tried to hijack my truck a few years ago so they could run booze over the border. You can't be too safe, you know?
C: GORDON
D: Yeah, I surely do.
N: Gordon smiles, moves as if to hand the pipe back...and suddenly SLAMS it DOWN on the Driver's head...over and over and over. Blood splatters his face. Breathing hard, Gordon shoves the Driver out of the truck into the undergrowth then drives off. CHANGELING A True Story 64.

N: Wearing a bandage on one arm, Christine is escorted down the hall by one of the nurses. She's led into --

N: -- where DOCTOR JONATHAN STEELE stands as Christine enters. He's in his fifties, heavy-set, serious.
C: STEELE
D: Mrs. Collins...Dr. Jonathan Steele. Please, have a seat.
N: The nurse leaves. Christine notes that there are three chairs in a row. Could be a test. She sits in the middle chair. Sits as straight as she can. Trying to look sane.
C: STEELE
D: I hope your stay has been comfortable so far.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Fine. Thank you.
C: STEELE
D: Really? I'd think it would be quite difficult at first.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Well, it was. Difficult, I mean. But comfortable.
E: catching herself
N: He makes a note of this. She grimaces. This isn't going well. He motions to the bandage on her arm.
C: STEELE
D: I see they took a blood test.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Wasserman Test. To check for syphilis. Apparently it can affect the mind.
C: STEELE
D: The idea that someone thinks you should be checked for syphilis...did that upset you?
C: CHRISTINE
D: No. Not at all. I'm sure it's... standard procedure.
N: She smiles a forced smile. Trying to appear level-headed. CHANGELING A True Story 65.
C: STEELE
D: Yes. Exactly. Standard procedure. We have to cover all bases, and --
C: CHRISTINE
D: But...at the same time...I imagine that it would be...would probably be upsetting to...some people that someone else might...suspect that of them. However inappropriate that might be.
E: covering her bases beat
N: She flashes another wan smile. He makes another note, picks up the report on his desk, glances it over.
C: STEELE
D: According to your file, you believe the police have substituted a fake boy for your son. Is that true?
C: CHRISTINE
D: I didn't say they substituted a fake boy, just...not the right boy. They brought back the wrong boy. Not my son. He's still missing.
E: beat
N: He starts pulling out papers from his file.
C: STEELE
D: That's strange...you see, I have here a newspaper article with a photo of you at the train station, welcoming your son home. That is you in the photo, isn't it?
C: CHRISTINE
D: Yes.
C: STEELE
D: So at first he was your son, but now he's not your son. Has this been going on for a long time? People...changing, becoming something other than what they are?

C: CHRISTINE
D: No. Of course not.
C: STEELE
D: The police are here to protect us.
C: CHRISTINE
D: That's right.
N: He nods. She's trying to say what she thinks he wants to hear. It's a chess match that ends with:
C: STEELE
D: That's odd, because according to the head nurse, when you were admitted you accused the police of conspiring to do this deliberately, to punish you. So either she and the interns are also conspiring against you...or you're changing your story. Do you often have trouble telling reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?

N: He sits back. Christine's face tells the story.

N: It's raining. The Administrator enters with Detective Ybarra.
C: ADMINISTRATOR
D: I'm sorry to bring you out in this weather, detective, but the boy has been quite insistent.

D: It's all right, I'll just see what he has to say so I can go home and get dry. Where is he?
C: ADMINISTRATOR
D: Room seven.
S: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: A single table, two chairs. Sanford sits quietly, nervously, as Ybarra hangs his wet coat up on a hook. CHANGELING A True Story 67.
C: YBARRA
D: It's raining cats, dogs and democrats out there, so this better be worth it.
N: He sits across the table from Sanford, lights up a cigarette. Sanford's mouth works for a moment, but nothing comes out.
C: YBARRA
D: Well?
C: SANFORD
D: Look, I -- this isn't easy, okay?
C: YBARRA
D: Nothing is.
N: A long BEAT. Sanford composes himself, begins:
C: SANFORD
D: My cousin's Gordon Northcott. He owns the ranch where you found me. He let me live there in exchange for watching the place when he was gone, doing chores, stuff like that. Said I could stay on as long as I wanted to. I figured that also meant I could leave whenever I wanted to, but he wouldn't let me.
C: YBARRA
D: Are you saying he held you prisoner? Bull. When I got to the ranch you were running around free as a jaybird. Could've left any time you wanted. So what's this, some kind of story to cover why you were in the country illegally?

N: Sanford closes his eyes. Takes a long beat. Finally....

N: Ybarra freezes, the cigarette not moving in his hand.

D: What kids?
C: SANFORD
D: I don't know...I never knew their names.
C: YBARRA
D: How many kids?
C: SANFORD
D: All together?
N: He thinks about it for a moment. The fact that he has to add them all up is almost as chilling as what follows next.

N: Gordon is at his truck, the same one we saw earlier, checking the engine as Sanford looks on nervously.

D: Sure thing. Your folks, they got in an accident. They sent us to find you. They're hurt real bad. The police took 'em to the hospital, but they didn't have time to come find you, so we said we'd do it. Now come on, hurry...we gotta get to the hospital, see your folks.
N: FLASH-IMAGE: Yet another kid, who hesitates, looks to Sanford.
C: SANFORD
D: A lot of kids won't get in a car alone with a stranger, but when he's got a kid there with him, that made it easier. They'd look to me, and figure if I was safe, they would be too. That's why he needed me, see?
E: V.O. beat

C: SANFORD
D: Some days he'd do 'em right off. Other days, he'd wait, pick up a few more, keep 'em in the coop until he had like four or five, 'cause -- -- 'cause he liked to hear 'em scream all at once. Like they were some kinda chorus. And then....

C: YBARRA
D: I haven't updated these in a while, but still, it should be.... Just go through...and if you see any faces you recognize, put it on the table.

N: Sanford takes the photos. Starts going through them. A photo, a face, goes down on the table. Then another. A third. With each photo slapped down the SLAP gets louder, BOOMING at us. Another photo. Another. Row after row. He's crying, sobbing, but still putting down photos. Then he SLAMS down the last one and half-falls, half-stumbles out of his chair, sobbing...goes to the corner of the room and slides down the wall until he's sitting in a fetal position, hands covering his face. Sobbing uncontrollably. Numb, Ybarra goes to the table, picks up a photo. Looks at it. Turns it over to the name, then picks up another. Then a third. When he picks up the fourth photo and turns it over, he stops, staring at it.

N: There's a disturbance off-screen and she goes to deal with it as Jones gets further wound up to ninety.
C: JONES
D: What the hell...?
N: He's drawn to the window by the sound of voices. He peeks through the slats. Several dozen placard-carrying parishioners and members of the Women's Temperance League are standing in the street, beating drums and calling Christine's name.

N: The electro-shock room. Carol struggles against the orderlies who force her down onto the gurney. A nurse behind her applies conductor jelly to her temples as another orderly shoves a rubber bite-guard into her mouth. Then a pair of metal pincers, points covered in cloth, are pressed against her temples. A button is pushed...and her body goes RIGID as a jolt of electricity blasts through her body. (This was, remember, fairly common practice for violent behavior in the 1920s.) Then she passes out, her eyes rolling up in her head.

N: Detective Ybarra is sitting at his desk, not happy about a lot of his life at this moment. He's turning over the photos of the missing kids identified by Sanford Clark and arranging them on his desk the way you might arrange cards, playing solitaire. He looks up -- -- to see Sanford being led out of one of the holding areas, hands cuffed, clothes in his hands. Being transferred to a waiting bus. The two exchange a look. Ybarra looks away. Sanford continues toward the bus. Finally, in agony, Ybarra can't take it any more. He rises, goes to the officer standing by the door to the bus.

D: This it? You're sure?
N: Sanford nods. Ybarra edges toward a shovel, hands it to him.
C: YBARRA
D: Dig. You put 'em in the ground, you can take 'em out of the ground. Go on.
E: off sanford's look
N: Sanford takes the shovel and starts cutting out sections of dirt and lye, dust rising around them. Ybarra watches, pensively, as the other officers edge their way in. He's looking the other way when one of the officers reacts:

N: The nurse behind Christine applies the conductor jell to her temples. She's fighting the best she can, but it's hopeless. The nurse picks up the electro-shock pincers. Places them on Christine's temples. Reaches for the button -- -- as suddenly the door opens, and a nurse steps in, stopping the process.

I'm a terror at Scrabble, crossword puzzles, but even I'm in awe of the vocabulary that the press and the city council have been exercising in reference to this department courtesy of the Christine Collins...incident. Incompetent. Cowardly. Bullying. Reprehensible. Mendacious and invidious...those two courtesy of that prick Gustav Briegleb. Bonus words in Scrabble, both of them. Especially invidious.

So "incompetent," as in -- "A department so incompetent that they never realized that up to twenty children were being kidnapped and murdered under their very noses." And here: "So incompetent that they insisted they knew better than a mother the identity of her own child, forced him upon her, and then incarcerated her when she confronted them with evidence of their own reprehensible behavior." That was a two-fer. Incompetent and reprehensible in the same sentence. Guy must be a real terror at crossword puzzles.

C: JONES
D: Sir?
N: Davis turns back to him from the window.
C: DAVIS
D: The Mayor wants this to go away. I want this to go away. The way you do that is to stop insisting that Walter Collins was not among those kids killed up at that goddamned ranch. Because if the boy you brought back isn't Walter Collins, and he's not dead up at that ranch, then where the hell is he? People will want to know why we haven't found him. Why we aren't we doing our job. But if, on the other hand, he is, or could be among those poor boys killed up in Wineville...then the inquiries stop. It's a momentary embarrassment that you'll have to live with...but better a short inconvenience than a lingering problem, wouldn't you say, Captain? Jones doesn't like it, but he swallows his pride. Nods.

C: JONES
D: Yes, sir.

D: Let me worry about the commission. But it wouldn't hurt to find out just who the fuck that kid is you brought back from De Kalb and why he did this, because the press bought into his bullshit same as we did.

N: Ybarra holds up a missing persons sheet.
C: YBARRA
D: Checks out. The report was filed by his divorced mother, who lives in Clinton, Iowa with the boy's grandmother. Apparently he didn't like living with the old lady, she didn't let him get away with the stuff he usually got away with, and one day...he up and left.
C: JONES
D: What about the man he showed up with at the diner?
C: YBARRA
D: Just some drifter. The boy was hungry, ran into this guy who said he knew how to get some food and not have to pay for it. Only when they finished, he left the kid behind while he cut out. When the police picked him up, they started going through the wire reports about missing kids --

D: I've been on the phone all day with the appointment secretary for the police commission. They won't let me testify at the hearing, or call witnesses. They say it's not necessary.
C: REV. BRIEGLEB
D: I know. My sources tell me the police commission is going to come out with a report that whitewashes the whole thing. They're going to say that Jones and the rest of the LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong, that the real blame is with the kid...and with you, for being difficult and forcing them to put you away for your own safety.

As a result, we have decided that Captain J. J. Jones of the Lincoln Heights Division is to be suspended from active duty, effective immediately.
C: REPORTER
D: What's the charge, Chief?
C: CHIEF DAVIS
D: The charge is conduct unbecoming an officer, and using improper and abusive language toward Mrs. Collins. It further charges that he exceeded his authority as a police officer by incarcerating Mrs. Collins on the alleged charge of insanity without sufficient cause.
C: REPORTER
D: Mayor Cryer, are you aware that the City Council has said it plans to open its own investigation into the Collins case?

Briegleb turns quickly, trying to get ahead, but the street's too busy. He looks in the mirror to see that another police car glide into position two cars behind them. Traffic stops. Jammed. Briegleb is nervous, sensing the very real possibility of a hit being set up. The traffic is lined right up against parked cars on either side. Then there's a momentary break in traffic.

C: JONES
D: Whether or not this was in fact the correct boy was not relevant to my decision. Throughout this period, she acted strangely. She was often cool, aloof and unemotional, especially when presented with the boy we located in De Kalb, and in our subsequent conversations. It was because of her disturbing behavior that I submitted her for observation to the psychopathic ward of Los Angeles County General Hospital.

The only one of you here worth a goddamn is her -- -- 'cause she's the only one never badmouthed me to the press.

C: GORDON
D: They're gonna let me have whatever I want for dinner. Got a steak coming, with spinach, mashed potatoes and green beans. I always wondered why they did that whole last meal thing. One of the other guys on Death Row said when you take the drop, you foul yourself, and everything you ate...comes out the other end. So maybe that's why they make sure you got something in you when it happens. They like knowing you fouled yourself on the way to --

D: Mr. Northcott...you asked me to come to see you. You said if I did, you would tell me the truth about my son. Well, I'm here.

Several other parents, including Mr. and Mrs. Clay, are in the witness gallery at the back, separated from the gallows area by a large plate glass window. Christine is among the parents. The Clays see her, and put a hand on her arm for strength. Christine nods, accepting it, and moves to one side. Northcott, legs and arms bound in chains, makes his way to the warden at the base of the gallows. A clock reads 9:50. CHANGELING A True Story 128.
C: WARDEN
D: Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have been found guilty of murder, the penalty for which is death by hanging. There have been no stays or reprieves, therefore the execution will go forward as stipulated under the laws of the State of California. Do you have any last words?
C: GORDON
D: No...nothing. I kept clean after I confessed, reverend...just like I said I would.

C: GORDON
D: Will it...will it hurt? Please...not so fast...don't make me walk so fast!
E: no reply
N: They struggle with him now, pushing and carrying him up the last of the thirteen steps to the top. They tie his legs together, and cinch his arms tightly in place.

D: Thirteen steps...thirteen steps... but I didn't touch all of 'em, you bastards...I didn't touch all of 'em!
N: They start to slip a black felt mask over his head and secure the rope. He looks desperately to the witnesses.
C: GORDON
D: A prayer! Please, somebody, say a prayer for me!
N: The mask goes on and is tightened into place. The executioner approaches the handle that will open the trap door. The warden looks to the clock...9:59. From beneath the hood we HEAR, in a terrified, shaking voice:

N: She turns and walks off into the night, as we SUPERIMPOSE: Gordon Stewart Northcott was hanged on October 2, 1935 In exchange for his cooperation and a guilty plea, Sanford Wesley Clark was sentenced to the Whittier State School for Boys for five years. Upon being released in 1934, he returned home to Canada, and was never heard from again. Upon returning to duty after his suspension, Captain J. J. Jones was demoted to Lieutenant and subsequently sued by Christine Collins in civil court. He was found guilty and fined $10,800 (equal to $125,000 in 2006 dollars). He never paid. One year after the City Council recommended the removal of the Los Angeles Chief of Police, James E Davis resigned from office and was replaced by Roy E. Steckel. CHANGELING A True Story 139. Davis reclaimed that office in 1933, where he created the Red Squad, notorious for attacking Communists and their offices, but was forced to resign a second time under a cloud of police corruption. In the aftermath of the City Council hearings, the criminal justice system in California was revised to prevent women from being incarcerated or institutionalized for the crime of disagreeing with a male police officer. Strict medical procedures were set in place to prevent future abuse. In November 1929, Los Angeles Mayor George E. Cryer was voted out of office after three terms. He was later found to have been the front man for the Crawford Organized Crime Syndicate, which ran prostitution and gambling rackets throughout Southern California. For the rest of his life, Reverend Gustav A. Briegleb used his radio show to expose police misconduct and political corruption. He also published "The Layman's Handbook of Daniel." The California community of Wineville, near Riverside, became synonymous with the infamous Northcott Murder Ranch. In order to shake free of the scandal, the residents changed its name to Mira Loma. Christine Collins never stopped searching for her son. The fate of Walter Collins remains a mystery. If he was able to escape the Northcott Ranch, he would be 86 years old today.
