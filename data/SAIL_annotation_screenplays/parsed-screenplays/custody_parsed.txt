S: EXT. AKRON'S CANAL PARK - DAY
N: RICK STEVENS, thirty-six, is Middle America personified. He blends in at the crowded ballpark. Blue jeans, work boots, a ball cap and leather jacket complete his attire. He snacks on a bag of popcorn. The CRACK of the bat and the CROWD is on their feet. A BALL PLAYER slides safely into second with a double. JOHN SILVERSTEIN, thirty-three, business clad, talks on his cell phone. Calm and collected he appears unaffected by the cheering crowd. The sits with the crowd.
C: RICK
D: Helluva talent, that kid.
N: John flashes a quick grin, never missing a beat in his phone call.

D: Probably be in the bigs in another year.

C: ZACH
D: I don't want to go. Melanie hastily dresses her son.
C: MELANIE
D: Zach, do you want mommy to get fired?
C: ZACH
D: Yes.
C: MELANIE
D: If I get fired we won't have the money to go to Six Flags. Zach quickly dresses himself. CUT TO:
S: EXT. AKRON'S CANAL PARK - DAY
N: John still talks on his cell.
C: RICK
D: Must be something to have that kind of talent. He's just a kid, nineteen, twenty tops, and if he stays healthy and he stays focused, the world is his oyster. Guys like you and me, we squandered those opportunities long ago.
N: John ends his call and turns back to Rick.
C: JOHN
D: You.
C: RICK
D: Huh?
C: JOHN
D: Guys like you...
C: RICK
D: And me...
C: JOHN
D: ... squandered opportunities. I, on the other hand, knew where I was going. I had that kind of drive, I just never had the talent.
C: RICK
D: You knew where you were going?
C: JOHN
D: Absolutely.
C: RICK
D: At nineteen?
C: JOHN
D: Without question.

C: ZACH
D: Mom?
N: Melanie pops her head back in the car.
C: MELANIE
D: What?
C: ZACH
D: I'm not thirteen. It's against the law to leave me alone in a car until I'm thirteen.
C: MELANIE
D: Come on.
N: Zach EXITS.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. AKRON'S CANAL PARK - DAY
N: John's phone RINGS. He ignores the call.

C: JOHN
D: I was the King of Focus.
C: RICK
D: The Duke of Diligence?
C: JOHN
D: The Count of Concentration.
N: Rick is still looking at John when he hears the CRACK of the bat.
C: RICK
D: Duck.
C: JOHN
D: Huh?
N: Rick ducks. John appears perplexed. John's POV: A foul ball is screaming in his direction. Too late: The ball strikes John in the face knocking him out of his seat. Rick recovers and continues to snack on his popcorn.

S: EXT. MAIN STREET - AKRON OHIO - DAY
N: The game is over. Rick and John stand at the front gate. The exiting CROWD flows around them. John holds an ice pack to the side of his face.
C: JOHN
D: I'm just saying grow up. You can't keep drifting.
C: RICK
D: I thought I did grow up...
C: JOHN
D: When you got married?
C: RICK
D: Yeah...
C: JOHN
D: You matured a little.
C: RICK
D: It's a process.
C: JOHN
D: No Bueller, it's a decision. One you need to make. You can't keep running without direction. If you don't know where you're going you'll never get what you want. CUT TO:
S: INT. DAIRY MART
N: Melanie and Zach stand at the counter. The CLERK rings them out. Zach grabs the bottle from the counter.
C: ZACH
D: I want Sobe.
N: Melanie snatches the bottle back.
C: MELANIE
D: Too bad.
N: An impatient LINE OF CUSTOMERS waits.
C: ZACH
D: I don't want Coke. I want Sobe.
N: Melanie puts the bottle back on the counter.
C: MELANIE
D: We'll take the soda.
E: To clerk.
N: Zach stomps his feet.
C: CLERK
D: Two dollars and...
C: MELANIE
D: Hold on a minute. Please?

N: The crowd has waned.
C: RICK
D: I thought I got direction...
C: JOHN
D: When Cindy had kids?
C: RICK
D: Yeah...
C: JOHN
D: They gave you purpose. But purpose, my friend, is not direction.
C: RICK
D: East.
C: JOHN
D: Huh?
C: RICK
D: My direction is east. I parked in the deck.
C: JOHN
D: I'm right around the...
C: RICK
D: Corner?
C: JOHN
D: Yeah.
C: RICK
D: We're always going in different directions.
C: JOHN
D: Mine are much more productive.
C: RICK
D: And much less adventurous.
C: JOHN
D: Well, I'm gonna...
C: RICK
D: Go?
C: JOHN
D: Yeah.
C: RICK
D: Then go.
C: JOHN
D: That's what I'm going to do. Responsibility calls. John turns and heads south. Rick takes a bite of popcorn, looks to the sky for a moment, grins, and heads off Northeast.
T: CUT TO:

D: Get a beer?
C: JOHN
D: Yeah.
C: RICK
D: Can't.
C: JOHN
D: Can't?
C: RICK
D: Gotta get home.
C: JOHN
D: Why?
C: RICK
D: Family, my man. Take time off for a ballgame ya should probably tend to the family too. You should try it sometime.
C: JOHN
D: In the grand scheme of things family is a liability, not an asset. Rick continues on.
C: JOHN
D: Do you even know what you're doing or where you're going?
E: Calling out.
C: RICK
D: East.
E: Yelling over his shoulder.
C: JOHN
D: East leads nowhere, my friend. You should be heading south. The bar is south. East takes you places you don't want to go.
N: Rick reaches the corner and darts across the street.

C: MELANIE
D: But...
C: BOSS

C: MELANIE
D: But...
C: BOSS
D: If a person isn't responsible enough to be prompt to their job, they're not responsible enough to work for me.
C: MELANIE
D: But...

C: RICK
D: What's going...
C: OFFICER ONE
D: Shaddup!
N: Officer Two cuffs Rick. Leaning in, he speaks in Rick's ear.
C: OFFICER TWO
D: You know your rights, cretin, but just in case you don't...
C: RICK
D: What the hell? Officer Two spins Rick to face him.
C: OFFICER TWO
D: You have the right to shut the hell up. Do you understand this right?
C: RICK
D: Yes.
N: Officer One appears very eager to discharge his weapon.
C: OFFICER ONE
D: Shut him the hell up, Jimmy.
C: OFFICER TWO
D: If you don't shut the hell up my partner might exercise his right to shoot you. Do you understand?
N: `Yes' begins to form on Rick's lips. A quick glance at Officer One and he decides to nod.
C: OFFICER ONE
D: He's looking at me funny, Jimmy.
C: OFFICER TWO
D: You have the right not to look at my partner in any way that might be construed as `funny' which could result in harm to your person. Do you understand this right?

C: OFFICER TWO
D: Really? I don't think he is. Are you twitching boy?
C: RICK
D: No Sir.
C: OFFICER ONE
D: Look at him, he's twitching. Nothing pisses me off more than twitching and talking. If he doesn't stop I'm gonna waste him.

C: DETECTIVE JOHNSON
D: What do we got here boys?
C: OFFICER TWO
D: It's him. We got him.
C: OFFICER ONE
D: He's a twitcher... a twitcher and a talker. Boy, I tell you, if he'd twitched one more time I would've deposited large amounts of hot lead in his ass.
C: DETECTIVE JOHNSON
D: I'll take it from here boys.
C: OFFICER TWO
D: Report too?
C: DETECTIVE JOHNSON
D: No, that's your job.

C: DETECTIVE JOHNSON
D: No one's getting shot today, Bobby.
C: OFFICER ONE
D: Can't I just wing him or something?
C: DETECTIVE JOHNSON
D: Jimmy; get him out of here.
N: Officer Two moves to his unwilling partner and helps him place his weapon in his holster. Officer One's hand is still clenched to his gun as Officer Two drags him around the car and forces him into the cruiser.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. AKRON POLICE DEPARTMENT - LINE UP ROOM
N: FIVE diverse MEN, including Rick, stand against the wall. On the other side of the mirror Detective Johnson sits with THE LADY IN BLACK (30's). A black veil streams from her hat covering her eyes, circa 1930's.

C: LADY IN BLACK

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS
N: Rick ENTERS on stage. The entire theater is cast in shades of gray. The stage is barren. There is no audience. He looks around for a moment and as he reaches center stage is once again flooded with the spotlight. Rick uses his arm to shade his eyes. SFX: A SOFT DIN OF VOICES. Looking stage left Rick realizes TWELVE JURORS have appeared in their box. A small AUDIENCE has congregated. SFX: THE DIN SWELLS TO A QUIET CHAOS. A RAPPING of a gavel and Rick's attention swings to a white haired JUDGE (70's).
C: JUDGE
D: Order in the court.
N: The noise level wanes, but not completely. Another RAP of the gavel.
C: JUDGE
D: Order in the court, I say.
N: Focused on the Judge, Rick doesn't notice THE PROSECUTOR approaching from stage right. Carrying a folding chair in one hand, notes and manila folders in the other, he sets the chair behind Rick.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Have a seat.
C: JUDGE
D: Do you know why you're here today, Mr. Stevens?
C: RICK
D: Why am I here?
C: JUDGE
D: Are you being rhetorical?
C: RICK
D: Are you asking me?
C: JUDGE
D: You stand here today an accused man.
C: RICK
D: Accused? Accused of what?
C: JUDGE
D: You have been placed in custody of your children.
C: RICK
D: Huh?
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Your children, Mr. Stevens. You do realize you have children, don't you?
C: RICK
D: Yes, but...
T: PROSECUTOR
N: But nothing Mr. Stevens, either you have children or you don't.
C: RICK
D: I do.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: So, you accept responsibility for bringing young life into the world?
C: RICK
D: I guess...
T: PROSECUTOR
N: There's no guessing, Mr. Stevens, either you're responsible for siring offspring or you aren't.
C: RICK
D: I am, but I'm not sure it was responsible.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: A crime of passion, Mr. Stevens? How convenient. (A beat) And you accept the consequences of said actions?
C: RICK
D: Why am I here?
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Why are you here, Mr. Stevens? Why are you here? I'll tell you why you're here. Are you familiar with Ms. Cynthia Stevens?
C: RICK
D: Yeah, she's my wife.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Was your wife, Sir. Was your wife. She recently filed for divorce. Were you aware of that?
C: RICK
D: No, no I wasn't.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Well, she did. She also named you as her coconspirator in the act of having children. Were you aware of that, Mr. Stevens?
C: RICK
D: Again, no.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Mr. Stevens, you just told the court that you aware you had children. You have also admitted that Ms. Cynthia Stevens was, in fact, your wife. (MOR E)
T: PRO SECUT OR (cont'd)
N: On top of that you told this court that you accepted the responsibility of having said children, did you not?
C: RICK
D: Yes, but...
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Then why, Mr. Stevens, do you continue to deny culpability in this situation? Rick realizes the audience has swelled to nearly a full house. Beads of sweat form on his brow.
C: JUDGE
D: Answer the question.
C: AUDIENCE
D: Answer the question.
N: Like a trapped animal, Rick looks for his escape.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: The question, Mr. Stevens.
C: RICK
D: How can you be sure it was me?
N: The audience hisses. The Judge RAPS his gavel.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: She picked you out of a lineup, Sir. What more do you need?
C: RICK
D: Time. PROSECUTOR Time is not an option, Mr. Stevens. Time --- is not --- an option.
N: A look of sad resignation crosses Rick's face.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: You don't deny being married to Ms. Stevens, nor do you deny the act of procreation. You seem to understand that your actions bear consequence. You seem to understand that with parenthood, came responsibility. (MOR E)
T: PRO SECUT OR (cont'd)
N: It seems to me, as it should to anyone with the capacity for simple deduction that you, Mr. Stevens, did willingly and knowingly enter into the commitments of parenthood fully aware of the potential pratfalls. Did you not?
C: RICK
D: Yes, yes I did.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: It's time to pay the piper, Mr. Stevens. (To the Judge) It is the recommendation of the State that Richard C. Stevens been sentenced to the fullest capacity allowed by law.
C: RICK
D: What about Cindy?
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Excuse me?
C: RICK
D: My ex, Cindy, what about her responsibilities to the children?
N: The Prosecutor moves to Rick and whispers in his ear.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: She cut a deal, Rick. You were the one we wanted. You were the one we got. She took the plea. Sure, it costs her financially. But what is freedom worth? A CLAMOR begins to rise from the crowd as they talk among themselves. The RAP of the gavel.
C: JUDGE
D: I see no reason to extend this any further. Mr. Stevens you have been found competent by the State and by this Court. You are completely cognizant of your surroundings, and you leave me no choice. This court finds you guilty as charged.
C: RICK
D: Guilty of what?
C: JUDGE
D: You are hereby remanded to custody of your children for no less than a lifetime. This Court is adjourned.
N: A GASP in the audience mixed with CHEERS. Rick appears dumbfounded. A BAILIFF approaches Rick and begins to lead him off stage. Rick scuffles and struggles. The Judge stands and begins to collect his files.
C: RICK
D: I can't do this alone. Don't make me do this alone. I'll never make it...
C: JUDGE
D: If you can't do the time, Mr. Stevens, then don't do the crime.

C: RICK
D: I don't know when we're going to see your mom again.
C: KRIS
D: Is she okay?
C: RICK
D: She's kind of mad at daddy.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Mommy mad at me too?
C: RICK
D: No, baby, not at all. Your mom needs time to work through some things. So, for awhile, it's just going to be us...
C: KRIS
D: What's she need time for?
C: RICK
D: To figure out who she is, where she's going, what she wants.
C: NICHOLAS
D: I miss mommy.
C: RICK
D: She misses you too, baby. And this isn't permanent... we're going to fight this... we're going to appeal. We'll take it to the Supreme Court if we have to.
C: KRIS
D: You don't want us either?
C: RICK
D: Of course I want you. I just don't think I should have to do this alone.
N: The jailer still lingers in the doorway, leaning against the bars.
C: JAILER
D: I feel for you, I really do, but I've seen your kind before. You're a lifer. Whether it's fair or not. Whether justice was served. It doesn't matter. You're here for the duration.
N: The boys cling to their father. The CLANK of the door being closed. The Jailer WHISTLES a sad spiritual as he walks away.

S: EXT. SUMMIT COUNTY JAIL - COURTYARD - DAY
N: Shaved and wearing sunglasses, Rick approaches his parents. He reaches his FATHER, (60's), first.
C: FATHER
D: Quite the pickle you've got yourself in.
C: RICK
D: So it seems.
N: Rick's MOTHER gives him a big hug.
C: MOTHER

C: RICK
D: Mom, don't... okay?
C: MOTHER
D: Just saying...
C: RICK

D: Watch the kids one night? I could use some time to myself.
C: MOTHER
D: Um... Yeah... okay... I suppose that would be all right... we'd have to ask your father, but I don't see why that would be a problem. Other than that everything's okay?
E: a beat
C: RICK
D: We're okay...
C: MOTHER
D: Because it doesn't have to be like this. Mary Ryan, a friend of mine, her son had the same thing happen to him. Wife just up and left with no warning at all. He didn't waste a day. No sir, he was up and at `em almost instantly. You can leave here, you know? Mary Ryan's son did.
C: RICK
D: I like it here, mom.
C: MOTHER
D: What's to like? It's dingy and filthy. It's no place to raise children.
C: RICK
D: It's home and it's stable. The one thing the boys need right now is stability.
C: MOTHER
D: You can't keep hiding forever.
C: RICK
D: It's been five days, mom. I'm not hiding. I just need time to adjust.
C: MOTHER
D: Mary Ryan's son thinks you're hiding.
C: RICK
D: Do I know this guy?

N: Rick shifts uncomfortably.
C: RICK
D: Sure, I guess.
C: DOCTOR
D: My son's a wuss. He cries over hangnails. My wife and I have tried everything to toughen him up, but nothing works. I was wondering if our kids could play together. Maybe some of Phillip's "boy" would rub off on Junior. CUT TO:

C: MOTHER
D: It can be done.
C: RICK
D: I don't see how.
C: MOTHER
D: Find a way. Everything happens for a reason. God doesn't abandon his children, and neither will you.
C: RICK
D: God doesn't pay day-care.
C: MOTHER
D: There are other things out there... less expensive ways.
C: RICK
D: Could you watch them?
C: MOTHER
D: Oh... uh... well... I don't think your father is willing to do that. We raised our kids, Rick.
C: RICK
D: How `bout tonight, so I can catch a breath?
C: MOTHER
D: What? My watching them while you were in there with Phillip wasn't enough? Make me feel guilty.
C: RICK
D: I'll just ask God to watch them. He never abandons his children.
N: Rick's mom reaches in her purse and pulls some bills from her wallet.
C: MOTHER
D: Take this.
C: RICK
D: I don't want your money mom.

D: Great.
E: Mumbling
N: Melanie ENTERS the cell followed by Zach.
C: RICK
D: You have a kid.
C: MELANIE
D: So do you.
C: RICK
D: Not criticizing, just surprised. I don't believe anyone at their old day-care had kids. If they did they kept them in a closet and only brought them out on special occasions. Christmas, Easter, an occasional birthday, and maybe when they had friends over for dinner, but only as a status symbol. It was like they'd say, "Here's the white picket fence. Here's the SUV. Here's the dog. Oh yes, here's the 2.5 children. Kids you can get back in the closet now."
C: MELANIE
D: You'd could make a fortune with a Renta- Kid business.
C: RICK
D: That has potential.
C: MELANIE
D: I've often thought of renting mine. Why pay for a baby-sitter when thousands of people would pay good money to set your kid on the mantle for a few hours?
C: RICK
D: So, what's his name?
C: ZACH
D: I'm Zach.
N: Rick drops to a knee and extends his hand.
C: RICK
D: Hello Zach. I'm Rick.
C: ZACH
D: You're old.
C: RICK
D: You got me there. I am old.
C: ZACH
D: How old?
C: RICK
D: Older than dirt. When I was a kid we didn't have dirt. We had rocks and we had hammers. If we wanted dirt we banged a few rocks with really big hammers, and then we had dirt.
C: MELANIE
D: Worked the chain gangs?
C: ZACH
D: You're too old for my mom.
N: Kris and Phillip who have been sitting in the corner realize they have visitors and spring to greet them.
C: RICK
D: This is Kristian. This is Phillip, and the little guy from the potty, is Nicholas. Guys, this is Zach and...
C: MELANIE
D: Mel.

D: Beautiful kids.
C: RICK
D: Thanks. So's your's.
C: MELANIE
D: Ever try Cheerios?
C: RICK
D: Huh?
C: MELANIE
D: For potty training. Give him something to aim at. Drop a Cheerio or two in the toilet and let him pee away.
C: RICK
D: I'll have to try that. So, any questions about the job? Melanie moves towards the boys.
C: MELANIE
D: I'm going to go talk to them for a little bit. I'll let you know.
N: Melanie crouches to the boy's level. They appear to take a real shine to her. Nicholas hands her a book, and the four of them move to the cell cot. The boys gather round.
C: ZACH
D: My mom tells great stories.
C: KRIS
D: We don't have a mom.
C: ZACH
D: That's okay, I don't have a dad.

C: RICK
D: You have a real knack there.
C: MELANIE
D: Not a knack really. It's just about finding hope in places there should be none.
C: RICK
D: Whatever it is, I've never seen them take to a woman like that. Melanie smiles.

C: RICK
D: Um... kinda.
C: WOMAN
D: You're a terrific man. Did I tell you I love kids? They love me. It just comes so instinctively even though I've never had kids myself. I get lots of practice with my nephews though. So, when can I meet your boys?

Nicholas cries at night because he thinks the house is filled with ghosts. Kiss him once on the forehead, once on the cheek and sing The Cradle Will Rock and he'll sleep the whole night through. Kris' favorite subject is math. He loves to read and write, but he doesn't do so well in social studies. He knows how to ride a bike. Why? Because I taught him. Phillip wants to learn but he's always afraid he'll fall. Nicky just likes to Flintstone his tricycle. Phillip's favorite cartoon is Tunenami.

C: A beat. MELANIE
D: Things change.

D: Yeah... yeah they do. Now if you'll excuse me I need to find the asparagus. I couldn't do it, ya know?
E: A beat
N: Melanie turns back around.
C: MELANIE
D: Do what?
C: CINDY
D: I always thought I wanted to be a parent, and I was really good at being pregnant, but I sucked as a mom. I know that now. I don't have what it takes.
C: MELANIE
D: I don't think I've ever felt as much pity for anyone as I do for you right now.
C: CINDY
D: Take care of my boys... all of them.

S: EXT. GORGE PARK - DAY
N: Rick and the boys stand by the river looking up a huge embankment. There appears to be no permanent trail. Looking up, scattered PEOPLE sit at different levels on the climb.
C: RICK
D: Well, guys, I guess this is it.
C: KRIS
D: We can do it daddy.
C: RICK
D: Yes we can.
N: Rick stretches out. The boys jog in place. Rick cracks his neck. The boys crack their knuckles. In SLOW MOTION they begin their ascent, running wildly up the incline. Rick falls flat on his face. The boys all trip over him, leaving them all in a pile. Rick bounces up and dusts himself off. The boys do the same and away they go.

N: Too late, Kris has tripped over a can of paint. As he sits on his butt a look of fear crosses his face, a tear forms in his eye. Rick takes his paintbrush and dots Kris on the nose.

D: But...
C: RICK
D: No buts: Put the stone down.
N: Off Screen SFX: A huge thud and someone rolling down the hill.

C: RESTING CLIMBER
D: Long way up.
C: RICK
D: Yeah.
C: RESTING CLIMBER
D: Long way down for that matter.
C: RICK
D: That too.
N: A beat.
C: RICK
D: So, what's your point.
C: RESTING CLIMBER
D: No point, just an observation. Drink?
N: The climber holds out a canteen.
C: RICK
D: I'm okay.
C: RESTING CLIMBER
D: For the boys.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Daddy, I'm thirsty. Rick studies the climber for a moment.
C: RICK
D: Go ahead.
N: The climber hands the boys the canteen.
C: RESTING CLIMBER
D: You know, if you stop here, halfway between a long way up and a long way down you really haven't accomplished much, have you?
C: RICK
D: We're not stopping. We're just resting.
C: RESTING CLIMBER
D: That's what I said, fourteen years ago. Rick looks toward the top.
C: RICK
D: We can do this.
C: RESTING CLIMBER

S: INT. THEATER
N: Rick is back on the stage. The audience is full.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: What is so important Mr. Stevens that you would burden this court with convening today?
C: RICK
D: I just needed clarification.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: On what, Mr. Stevens? On what?
C: RICK
D: I know if I have to, I can do this alone, but do I have to do this alone? A hushed MURMUR rises in the audience. The Judge RAPS his gavel on the bench.
C: JUDGE
D: Order in this court! A beat as things quiet down.
C: JUDGE
D: Your inquiry, Mr. Stevens? Is it in the best interest of the children or in the best interest of you?
E: CONT'D
C: RICK
D: I don't know.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: He doesn't know. He just doesn't know.
C: RICK
D: I don't know.
C: JUDGE
D: Then this court sees no reason to amend the original verdict. The order stands.
C: RICK
D: But...
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Tell it to someone who cares, Mr. Stevens.
C: RICK
D: I have. I have laid my heart out on the line time and time again, only to walk away empty handed. This love, this caring, this sharing of life, it's a sentence and my heart has been condemned. It doesn't matter who I've told, what's in my heart is never quite enough. The people I have cared for most have shunned me in life and in love. Unanswered phone calls... Unnoticed displays of affection... A rose that withers on the doorstep... No matter what I do, it's never enough. Just once, just one fucking time, I want to be enough.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Your only condemnation is self- pity. You have people that care all around you, but you're too blind to see them. If you don't pull yourself together soon, my friend, they soon will all be gone.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARK - DAY
N: In B&W SLO-MO: Rick stands watching his sons play. The wind blows the leaves of a tree. The boys run further and further out until they are out of sight. Rick calls out to them. Slowly, across the field, three young adults return. Rick is now an old man, hunched over and aged with wrinkles. The three young men walk beside their elderly father, supporting him with each step.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MELANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Rick is holding flowers. The boys have an assortment of "instruments" to add a serenade. The music is a mishmash of odd notes that could only be construed as music to a parent's ear. Melanie stands on the front porch, her arms crossed.
C: MELANIE
D: What do you want?
C: RICK
D: I'm a proud man, sometimes foolish.
C: MELANIE
D: Go on.
C: RICK
D: I have a long way to go before I could ever be the man you need me to be.
C: MELANIE
D: And?
C: RICK
D: And I got confused between what I should have done and what I thought was right.
C: MELANIE
D: Yes you did.
C: RICK
D: I put you on a pedestal and then I knocked you down. It wasn't fair.
C: MELANIE
D: Life's not fair Rick.
C: RICK
D: You were more a mother to my boys than they have ever known. You were more a woman to me than I have ever deserved.
C: MELANIE
D: You're right.
C: RICK
D: You're not going to make this easy, are you?
C: MELANIE
D: Cut the bullshit, Rick.
N: Rick wraps his arms around Melanie and pulls her in for a hug.
C: RICK
D: I can live my life alone. I can raise my kids alone. I can walk this path alone. I'd much rather do it with you.
E: In Mel's ear
N: Grabbing him by the collar she's torn. Melanie shakes her head.
C: MELANIE
D: I can't.
N: She turns to go inside.
C: RICK
D: Can't?
C: MELANIE
D: I won't.
E: Turning back around.
C: RICK
D: I shouldn't have come here.
C: MELANIE
D: No, you shouldn't have.
N: Rick turns to leave.

D: Get what?

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MELANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT - DAYDREAM
N: Melanie lays in bed covering her ears.
C: MELANIE
D: Days go by when I lose me. There are nights when I lay in bed and I can hear Zach through the walls. He's crying out for me, and I lay there motionless, wishing I was anyone but me, anywhere but here, thinking that somewhere, sometime, there has to be room for me. But that someday never seems to come. You're dangerous. Loving you means I lose me. And I will never lose let that happen.
E: VO MOR E
C: MEL ANIE
D: So, don't come knocking on my door, asking for my heart, if you don't have room for me.
E: VO cont'd
N: Melanie ENTERS the house closing the door behind her. Rick tosses the flowers on the porch, turns and walks away. The boys follow behind.
C: KRIS

C: KRIS But I look sadder. NICHOLAS
D: I sad.

D: Daddy doesn't quit.

D: Does your heart skip a beat when she walks by?
C: RICK
D: She's my best friend... or was.
C: JOHN
D: Does your heart skip a beat when she walks by?
C: RICK
D: Yes.
C: JOHN
D: Do your palms sweat when you think about her?
C: RICK
D: Yes.
C: JOHN
D: Does she inspire you?
C: RICK
D: With music and poetry.
C: JOHN
D: And is there passion?
C: RICK
D: There's fire.
C: JOHN
D: And have you ever told her this?
C: RICK
D: She knows.
C: JOHN
D: Have you ever told her this?
C: RICK
D: No.
C: JOHN
D: Don't you think you should?
C: RICK
D: It only confuses things.
C: JOHN
D: Loving your best friend confuses things? I can't think of a love more lucid. Rick stands to leave.
C: JOHN
D: You know I'll never forgive you for this, don't you? You had the power and the dream at your fingertips and you're giving it all away.
C: RICK
D: You didn't marry your best friend?
C: JOHN
D: No.
C: RICK
D: I thought you had things all planned out.
C: JOHN
D: Affairs of the heart and those of the mind are two different things.
C: RICK
D: It's not too late, you know?
N: With a shrug John drops to one knee in front of Rick.
C: RICK
D: Go Home, John. Go home and talk to your best friend the way you talk to me.
S: INT. PARENT'S HOUSE
N: Rick BURSTS through the front door. His mother appears aghast.

C: FATHER
D: Woman, enough.

D: No more excuses. It's time to live life and enjoy our grandkids. Go. The boys will be fine.

C: MELANIE
D: So, where are the boys?
C: RICK
D: They're at my parents.
C: MELANIE
D: What? Not going to use them to try to persuade me with guilt?

C: CUSTOMER 2
D: Ma'am.
C: RICK
D: Excuse us for a moment okay?
E: To Customer 2
C: CUSTOMER 2
D: I'd just like some coffee.
N: Melanie walks off. Rick grabs a cup from a recently vacated table and sets it in front of the patron.
C: CUSTOMER 2
D: Excuse me, Miss?
E: Calling out.
C: RICK
D: What is your problem?
C: CUSTOMER 2
D: Cold.
C: RICK
D: What?
C: CUSTOMER 2
D: The coffee, it's cold.
N: Rick picks up the cup, pulls a lighter from his pocket and runs it several times under the mug.
C: RICK
D: Quit your bitching.
E: Setting the cup back down.
N: Rick moves to Melanie.
C: MELANIE
D: I can't believe you came here.
C: RICK
D: I can't believe you're a waitress.
C: MELANIE
D: Beats chasing around after snot nosed brats all day.
C: RICK
D: I thought you liked my kids.
C: MELANIE
D: I was talking about you. Melanie moves on. Rick gives chase. He catches her and spins her around spilling coffee all over the floor.
C: RICK
D: I deserved that.
C: MELANIE
D: So, what do the kids need? A babysitter? A surrogate mom?
C: RICK
D: This isn't about the kids.
C: MELANIE
D: Then what's it about?
C: RICK
D: It's about me, the selfish prick.
C: MELANIE
D: About you?
C: RICK
D: Hear me out, okay?
C: MELANIE
D: You have 15 seconds.
E: Looking at her watch.
C: RICK
D: Okay, okay.
C: MELANIE
D: Ten.
C: RICK
D: Melanie, there is a grace about you that reminds me how clumsy I am. There is an honesty about you that reminds me how deceitful I can be. There is a beauty in your eyes that reminds me how ugly I've become. There is a kindness in your voice that contradicts my coarseness. There is a glow around you that illuminates my dullness. There is spirit in you that challenges my laziness, but most of all, there is a woman in you, that sparks my desire, a desire to be graceful and honest and beautiful and kind. A desire to be better than I am or ever thought I could be.
C: MELANIE
D: Go on.
C: RICK
D: I think my ten seconds are up.
C: MELANIE
D: Who's counting?
C: CUSTOMER 2
D: Miss... My coffee?
N: Melanie sets the coffee on a nearby table.
C: MELANIE
D: Get it yourself.
C: RICK I love you. MELANIE
D: I don't think I heard you.
C: RICK
D: If I give you my heart will you promise to treat it softly? Kiss it when it hurts? Put it in a box and know that it belongs to you?
C: MELANIE
D: That's not what you said.
C: RICK
D: I said I love you.
C: MELANIE
D: As brutal as that can be?

C: RICK
D: I had to find me first. I hope you plan on walking, cause I'm not sure I can carry you.
C: MELANIE
D: So, how do we do this? The two begin the ascent together.
C: RICK
D: One step at a time?

D: A bunch of innocent bystanders?
C: RICK
D: And they all sat passing judgement on me, not knowing the situation, just staring over their schoolmarm spectacles and pointing their crooked fingers.
