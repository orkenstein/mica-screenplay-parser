ON THE SOUNDTRACK: In the distance, growing louder..over the Gentle clip clop of an approaching cart and horse can be heard the HUMMING OF A DEEP VOICE to the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On..." SUDDENLY! The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight with EXCITEMENT! Tossing away the long stem of grass in his mouth, Frodo runs off.
T: CUT TO:

C: FRODO
D: You're late.
N: CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit...
C: GANDALF
D: A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.
N: They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front seat of the cart.
C: FRODO
D: It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!
N: Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3 foot 6 inches tall.

D: What news of the outside world? Tell me everything!
N: ANGLE ON: Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye.
C: GANDALF
D: What, everything? Far too eager and curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...
N: Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy Hobbit Marketplace.
C: GANDALF
D: Well, what can I tell you? Life in the wide world goes on much as if it has past age. Full of its own comings and goings, scarcely even aware of the existence of Hobbits...
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before him.

C: GANDALF
D: Oh, really?
N: Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes.
C: FRODO
D: Alright then..keep your secrets. Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of.
C: GANDALF
D: Indeed?
C: FRODO
D: Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
C: GANDALF
D: If you're referring to the incident with the Dragon...I was barely involved...all I did was give your Uncle a little nudge out the door.
C: FRODO
D: Whatever you did...you've been officially labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.
C: GANDALF
D: Oh, really?
N: ANGLE ON: ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the Cart passes by, deeply suspicious.

S: EXT. HOBBITON -- DAY
N: CRANE UP: As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton...a quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills and large trees. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: The Hobbits live in Hobbit Holes: neat burrows dug into the grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens. ANGLE ON: Excited children, chasing after the cart. CLOSE ON: Gandalf ignOrcs the children's cries. The children stand deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane. At that moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children. ANGLE ON: Gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. ODO PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle. Frodo stands up in the cart as Gandalf reigns in the horse.
C: FRODO
D: Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf smiles.
C: GANDALF
D: So am I, dear boy...so am I
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BAG END -- DAY
N: Wide on: GANDALF'S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG END...a particularly fine example of a Hobbit hole, with a large round front door set into a grassy hillside. There is a sign on the gate which reads: "NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS." Gandalf strides up to the garden path of Bag End. He raises his staff and raps on the front door...a voice calls out:
C: BILBO
D: No, thank you! We don't want any more visitors, well wishers, or distant relations.
E: O.S.
C: GANDALF
D: And what about very old friends?
N: Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him. He is a HOBBIT OF INDERTIMINATE AGE, with a mischievous Twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he looks every inch the eccentric gentleman. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: BILBO
D: Gandalf?
C: GANDALF
D: Bilbo Baggins!
C: BILBO
D: My dear Gandalf!
N: Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.
C: GANDALF
D: It's good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old, who would believe it!
N: Gandalf looks at him more keenly.
C: GANDALF
D: You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo laugh together and enter Bag End.
E: CONT'D
C: BILBO
D: Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome!!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- DAY
N: Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End...cozy and cluttered with souvenirs of Bilbo's travels. Gandalf has to stoop to avoid hitting his head on the low ceiling. Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.
C: BILBO
D: Tea? Or maybe something stronger... I've a few bottles of the Old Winyard left, 1296...a very good year, almost as old as I am. It was laid down by my father. What say we open one, eh?
E: Calling
N: Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns, knocking his head on the light and then walking into the wooden beam. He groans.
C: BILBO
D: I was expecting you some time last week. Not that it matters, you come and go as you please, always have done, always will.
E: O.S. CONT'D MORE
N: (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED: BILBO
D: You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no, that might be a little risky...
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf smiles to himself.
C: BILBO
D: Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple tart...got some custard somewhere. Not much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh no...we're alright...I've just found some sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope it's enough. I could do you some eggs if you like?
E: CONT'D comes into view
N: Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf mysteriously appears behind him.
C: GANDALF
D: Just tea, thank you.
C: BILBO
D: Oh..right. You don't mind if...?
C: GANDALF
D: No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud knock on the front door.
N: MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.) Bilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there.
C: BILBO
D: I'm not home.
N: Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide.
C: BILBO
D: I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace. I want to see mountains again...mountains, Gandalf... and then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book...Oh, Tea!
E: CONT'D
C: GANDALF
D: So, you mean to go through with your plan, then?
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: BILBO
D: Yes, yes...it's all inhand. All the arrangements are made.
C: GANDALF
D: Frodo suspects something.
C: BILBO
D: 'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not some block headed Bracegirdle from Hardbottle!
C: GANDALF
D: You will tell him, won't you?
C: BILBO
D: Yes, yes.
C: GANDALF
D: He's very fond of you.
C: BILBO
D: I know. He'd probably come with me if I asked him. I think, in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods and the fields... little rivers. Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen window.
C: BILBO
D: I am old, Gandalf... Bilbo looks at Gandalf sadly...
E: CONT'D
C: BILBO
D: I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart.
E: CONT'D
N: CLOSE ON: Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping a small, unseen object.
C: BILBO
D: I feel thin...sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday...a very long holiday and I don't expect I shall return...in fact, I mean not to.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BAG END -- EVENING
N: Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch. Below them, final preparations are being made on the Party field. Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe.
C: BILBO
D: Old Toby, the finest weed in Southfarthing!
N: Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring.
C: BILBO
D: Ohhhh, Gandalf my old friend...this will be a night to remember!
E: CONT'D smiles
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON -- NIGHT
N: BOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above Hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding branches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories. Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit, Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.
C: FRODO
D: Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.
C: SAM
D: I think I'll just have myself another ale.
E: horrified
C: FRODO
D: Oh, no you don't. Go on.
N: Sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing throng of dancers. ANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE as he is Swept away. Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer. ANGLE ON: Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests. Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a group of young hobbit children.
C: BILBO
D: So, there I was...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of a troll? Do you know what a Troll is? Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly things..and they're arguing...arguing about how they were going to cook us!
E: melodramatic
N: ANGLE ON: A LITTLE HOBBIT GIRL'S upturned face...her eyes growing larger and larger.
C: BILBO
D: Whether it be turned on a spit or minced in a pie or whether they were going to sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly! But they spent so long arguing the whether-to's and why-for's that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees...and turned them all to stone!
N: STUNNED GASPS from his young Audience greet his astonishing feat! Close on: MERRY AND PIPPIN, two mischievous Young Hobbits in their late teens. Pippin scrambles on to the back of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework
C: MERRY
D: No, no..the big one...the big one! Pippin grabs a huge rocket. CLOSE ON: FIREWORK FUSE crackles with flame!
E: urgent whisper
N: Merry is holding out the big rocket...he looks aghast at the fizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit.
C: MERRY
D: You're supposed to stick it in the ground!
E: CONT'D worried whisper
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: PIPPIN
D: It is in the ground.
N: Merry fearfully tosses the Rocket to Pippin! The fuse sizzles angrily.
C: MERRY
D: Outside!
C: PIPPIN
D: It was your idea.
N: Pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry. WHOOSH! The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening power. The ROCKET ZOOMS over the Party..It suddenly bursts apart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon! Fire gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low towards the startled crowd. Close on: Frodo watches the Fireworks Dragon with alarm...but Bilbo is oblivious to the Panicking crowd and impending danger!
C: FRODO
D: Bilbo! Watch out for the dragon!!
C: BILBO
D: Dragon? Nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years!
N: ANGLE ON: FRODO As he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express train! Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents collapse, food flies everywhere. The fireworks dragon turns a somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang! This gets the biggest Cheer of the night. ANGLE ON: MERRY AND PIPPIN, clothes and hair smoking.
C: MERRY
D: That was good!
C: PIPPIN
D: Let's get another one!
N: LARGE HANDS suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears. Low angle: Gandalf looking DOWN STERNLY! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: GANDALF
D: Meridoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took...I might have known!
T: CUT TO:
N: MERRY AND PIPPIN Are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy water...with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and sipping an ale. Cries of "SPEECH! SPEECH" erupt from the party. ANGLE ON: Bilbo stepping on a stool...he bows in gratitude at the applause.
C: FRODO
D: Speech!
C: BILBO
D: My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and Brandybucks...Grubbs, Chubbs, Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and Proudfoots...
E: clearing throat
N: ANGLE ON: A HOBBIT WITH PARTICULARLY BIG FEET
C: ODO PROUDFOOT
D: Proudfeet!
C: BILBO
D: Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday. Yes, and alas...Eleventy- one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits! Tremendous outburst of approval!
C: BILBO
D: I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you as well as well as you deserve.
E: CONT'D
N: SCATTERED CLAPPING as the guests try to work out if that was a compliment or not. CLOSE ON: FRODO AND GANDALF smiling to themselves. CLOSE ON: Bilbo...a strange hum seems to fill his head. A bead of sweat rolls down his brow. Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and holds it behind his back. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: BILBO
D: I have..things to do and I have put this off for far too long... CLOSE ON: BILBO'S knuckles turn white as he tightens his grip on the small object behind his back.
E: CONT'D
C: BILBO
D: I regret to announce, this is the end. I am going now. I bid you all a very fond farewell!! Bilbo looks across at Frodo, hesitates... then...
E: CONT'D
C: BILBO
D: Goodbye.
E: CONT'D whisper
N: Bilbo instantly vanishes. The party explodes into an uproar... the crowd leaps to its feet. ANGLE ON: FRODO staring at the empty stool in disbelief.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT
N: The party is still in an excited uproar... some 50 yards away as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of Bag End. Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand.
S: INT. BAG END -- NIGHT
N: The door quietly closes...Bilbo materializes as he pulls a plain gold ring off his finger. Bilbo laughs as he tosses the ring in the air, then places it in his pocket. ANGLE ON: Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. He finds Gandalf looming over him.
C: GANDALF
D: I suppose you think that was terribly clever?
C: BILBO
D: Come on, Gandalf! Did you see their faces?
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: GANDALF
D: There are many magic rings in the world, Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be used lightly.
C: BILBO
D: It was just a bit of fun. Oh, you're probably right as usual.
C: GANDALF
D: You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
C: BILBO
D: I'm leaving everything to him.
C: GANDALF
D: What about this ring of yours? Is that staying too?
N: Close on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the mantelpiece.
C: BILBO
D: Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty surprise.
C: BILBO
D: No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?
E: CONT'D
C: GANDALF
D: I think you should leave the Ring behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard?
C: BILBO
D: Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it. It's mine. I found it. It came to me!
N: ANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN.
C: GANDALF
D: There's no need to get angry.
C: BILBO
D: Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's mine. My own, my precious.
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: GANDALF
D: Precious? It's been called that before, but not by you.
C: BILBO
D: So? What business is it of yours what I do with my own things? Bilbo's voice, shape and manner have suddenly changed.
C: GANDALF
D: I think you've had that ring quite long enough.
C: BILBO
D: You want it for yourself!
N: Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow suddenly seems to fill the room
C: GANDALF
D: Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression softens.
C: GANDALF
D: I am not trying to rob you. I am trying to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to Gandalf and hugs him.
E: CONT'D
C: GANDALF
D: All you long years we've been friends...trust me as you once did. Let it go!
E: CONT'D

His Orcs have multiplied...his fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in the second darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it, all his thought is bent on it. For the ring yearns, above all else, to return to the hand of its master: they are one, the ring and the dark lord.

D: Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws her sword and yells at the Witch King.
C: ARWEN
D: If you want him, come and claim him.
E: yelling
N: THE WITCH KING SCREECHES ANGRILY, draws his sword, and leads the Ringwraiths across the Ford. The water starts flowing faster...a distant rumble can be heard. Arwen waits until they are halfway across: she suddenly stands in the saddle arms raised!

N: THE GROUND SUDDENLY TREMBLES...A MIGHTY ROAR FILLS THE AIR! Frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of Water flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had burst! The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing white horses with frothing manes! The Ringwraiths scream in terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. Their Piercing cries are drowned in the roaring of the river as it carries them away! CLOSE ON: FRODO as he loses consciousness...
C: ARWEN
D: No, no...Frodo, no! Frodo, don't give in...not now!
E: upset

D: Gandalf!
E: weak relief
S: ANGLE ON: GANDALF IS SITTING NEXT TO FRODO'S BED...
N: softly puffing on his pipe. He smiles at Frodo.
C: GANDALF
D: Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be here, too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. You have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.
N: Frodo sits up, looking at Gandalf questioningly...
C: FRODO
D: What happened, Gandalf? Why didn't you meet us?

C: GANDALF
D: There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only one who can bend it to his will...and he does not share power.
N: SUDDENLY! GANDALF lurches to his feet and Throws himself off the Tower! Saruman watches Gandalf fly away from Isengard...on the Back of a GIANT EAGLE.

D: Frodo! Frodo! Bless you, you're awake!!
C: GANDALF
D: Sam has hardly left your side.
C: SAM
D: We were worried about you--weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?
C: GANDALF
D: By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend. ELROND, LORD OF THE HIGH ELVES, steps up to Frodo's
N: bedside...his face is neither old nor young, though in it is written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful.

D: Bilbo!
N: LATER... Frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of a red leather bound journal:

D: "There and back again: A Hobbit's tale" by Bilbo Baggins.
E: CONT'D reading

D: This is wonderful.
E: CONT'D
C: BILBO
D: I meant to go back...wander the paths of Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely Mountain again...but age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.
N: Frodo turns a page...there before him, is a map of the Shire.
C: FRODO
D: I miss the Shire...I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else...off with you, on one of your adventures... But my own adventure, turned out to be quite different...I'm not like you, Bilbo.

N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:

D: I do...
C: FRODO
D: More than anything.

D: I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell...and I thought... seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon. Off home.
C: FRODO
D: You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam...
C: FRODO
D: ...we did what we set out to do. Frodo opens his hand, the Ring sits in his Palm.

C: ELROND
D: His strength returns.
C: GANDALF
D: That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life.
C: ELROND
D: And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring...the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.
C: GANDALF
D: It is a burden he should never have to had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.
C: ELROND
D: Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's forces are massing in the east. His eye is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows thin.
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: GANDALF
D: His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in Sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring.
N: Elrond turns and walks away...
C: ELROND
D: This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves...We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay here.
N: Gandalf turns and looks out the window. Sounds of arrivals...Gandalf watches as Boromir rides through Rivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli.
C: ELROND
D: This peril belongs to all Middle earth. They must decide how to end it. Not just for themselves but for those who come after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: ELROND
D: The time of the Elves is over. My people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we have gone? The dwarves? They hide in their mountains seeking riches. They care nothing for the troubles of others.
E: CONT'D
C: GANDALF
D: It is in Men that we must place our hope.
C: ELROND
D: Men? Men are weak. The race of Men is failing. The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. It is because of men the Ring survives.
N: FLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, Isildur slices off Sauron's finger. Elrond reacts.

N: Elrond turns to Gandalf.

C: BOROMIR
D: The shards of Narsil...the blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand. Boromir picks up the sword and gently touches the Blade. Close on: a small bloom of blood appears on Boromir's finger...

C: BOROMIR
D: It is a gift...a gift to the foes of Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, held the forces of Mordor at bay...by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy...let us use it against him!
C: STRIDER
D: You cannot wield it. None of us can. The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it has no other master. Boromir turns and looks at Strider, coolly.
C: BOROMIR
D: And what would a ranger know of this matter?
N: Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively. LEGOLAS stands...
C: LEGOLAS
D: This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance.

N: Gimli suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack! Gimli falls backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodo winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps in this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him with concern.
C: ELROND
D: The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any craft that we
C: ELROND
D: here possess. The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom...only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor, and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. One of you must do this.
E: CONT'D
N: Stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice
C: BOROMIR
D: One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust...the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly.
C: LEGOLAS
D: Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The ring must be destroyed.
C: GIMLI
D: And I suppose you think you're the one to do it?

N: CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in a strong, clear voice.
C: FRODO
D: I will take it...I will take it...I will take the Ring to Mordor.
N: Sudden silence...Frodo looks around the room at the astounded faces.

D: No, Gimli. I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.

E: urgently
C: GANDALF
D: No!
N: GANDALF RAISES HIS STAFF...HE CHANTS INTO THE WIND.
C: GANDALF
D: Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho I ruith. Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath.
E: YELLING
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ISENGARD -- DAY
N: CAMERA SWEEPS PAST SARUMAN...he stands on the summit of Orthanc, Chanting. CLOUDS ARE FLOWING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS... converging on the distant mountains in a stormy Malestrom.
S: EXT. PASS OF CARADHRAS -- DAY
N: Saruman's voice strengthens...rolling past the fellowship like thunder. A LIGHTNING CRACK explodes on the mountainside above them. Frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche thunders down towards them! The Fellowship throw themselves against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge. LEGOLAS pulls Gandalf to safety. Aragorn shields Frodo and Sam as snow piles around them. Within moments, the pass is blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow. Boromir and Aragorn frantically dig for the hobbits...who are pulled out Shivering and Fearful.
C: BOROMIR
D: We must get off the mountain! Make for the gap of Rohan and take the West road to my city.
E: urgent
C: ARAGORN
D: The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard.
C: GIMLI
D: We cannot pass over the mountain. Let us go under it. Let us go through the mines of Moria. Gandalf has a concerned look on his face.
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: SARUMAN
D: Moria. You fear to go into those mines, don't you? The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.
E: V.O.
C: SARUMAN
D: You know what they awoke in, the darkness of Khazad-dum. Shadow and flame.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: GANDALF
D: Let the ringbearer decide.
N: CLOSE ON: FRODO, the weight of the decision weighing heavily upon him. CLOSE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN shivering in Boromir's arms.
C: GANDALF
D: Frodo?
E: CONT'D
N: Frodo meets Gandalf's eye.
C: FRODO
D: We will go through the mines. Gandalf slowly nods.
C: GANDALF
D: So be it.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT
N: The Fellowship are walking along the far shore of dark lake...directly below great looming cliffs.
C: GIMLI
D: The walls of Moria!
E: in awe
N: Footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and greasy stones. Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between the trees... slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of luminous silver running through the stone.
C: GANDALF
D: Itidin...it mirrors only starlight and moonlight.
N: A large moon rises over the mountains... The lines grow Broader and Clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing ancient letters and symbols. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: GANDALF
D: It reads, "The door of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter."
E: CONT'D
C: MERRY
D: What do you suppose that means?
C: GANDALF
D: It's quite simple. If you are a friend, speak the password and the doors will open.
E: confident
N: Gandalf raises his arms...
C: GANDALF
D: Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!
E: CONT'D incanting
N: The cliff towers into the night, the wind blows cold, Frodo shivers... and the door stands fast! LATER: GANDALF CONTINUES... Mumbling spells in his efforts to open the door. Sam packs pots and pans at his feet...watching sadly as Aragorn un- saddles Bill the pony. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN whispering to Bill the Pony.
C: ARAGORN
D: Mines are no place for a Pony, even one so brave as Bill.
E: whispering
C: SAM
D: Bye, Bill.
C: ARAGORN
D: Go on, Bill, go on..don't worry, Sam...he knows his way home. Aragorn slaps Bill on the rump...Bill goes trotting off. CLOSE ON: Sam watching Bill disappear into the darkness.
C: SAM
D: Goodbye, Bill.
N: SPLASH! Merry and Pippin are tossing stones into the lake. Black Rippling rings slowly fan out. Pippin is about to throw another stone, but Aragorn grabs his arm. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: ARAGORN
D: Do not disturb the water.
E: ominous
N: Aragorn watches anxiously as the Ripples appear to grow....he exchanges a look with Boromir. Aragorn's hand creeps towards his sword. Gandalf gives up in despair...he sits down beside Frodo. Close on: Frodo peers at the Elvish inscription...his face breaks into a smile of comprehension.
C: FRODO
D: It's a riddle...
E: quietly
N: Gandalf raises his eyebrows...
C: FRODO
D: Speak, friend, and enter. What's the Elvish for friend?
E: CONT'D explaining
C: GANDALF
D: Oh...mellon.
N: With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and two great Doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enter the Blackness, something in the water stirs....
S: INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT
N: The Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria...a Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the mountain.
C: GIMLI
D: So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves; roaring fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone. This, my friend, is the home of my cousin, Balin...and they call this a Mine... A mine!
E: snorting
N: A Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights the chamber... The Fellowship recoil in Horror! Many dwarf Skeletons are strewn about, clearly the dead of some old battle...the rusting armor and shields are peppered with arrows and axes. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: BOROMIR
D: This is no mine...it's a tomb!
E: grimly
C: GIMLI
D: Oh...no...no..no... ! Legolas pulls a crude arrow out of a skeleton.
E: in horror
C: LEGOLAS
D: Goblins!
N: The Fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the Entrance.
C: BOROMIR
D: We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here.
S: EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT
N: Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20 more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature. Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into Boromir's arms.
C: GANDALF
D: Into the mines!
C: BOROMIR
D: Legolas!
N: Legolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of the water with Frodo. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from the Creature... retreating into the Moria Chamber as many Coiling arms seize the large doors.
S: INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT
N: With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away, creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face. Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway... throwing the Fellowship into Pitch Blackness. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy Glow across the old wizards face.
C: GANDALF
D: We now have but one choice...we must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard...there are older and fouler things than the Orcs in the deep places of the world.
E: ominous
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NEW CHAMBER, MORIA -- NIGHT
N: WIDE ON: the Fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above deep mine workings.
C: GANDALF
D: Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence will go unnoticed.
S: INT. MORIA CEMETERY CAVERN -- NIGHT
N: They continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf cemetery. The graves are despoiled...dwarf skeletons are strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in dried Dwarf blood. The Atmosphere is very sinister.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MORIA TUNNEL FORK -- NIGHT
N: The path splits into three passages...each disappearing into dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning.
C: GANDALF
D: I have no memory of this place.
N: LATER... The Fellowship are nervously waiting...while Gandalf sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of him. He appears to be in some kind of trance. CLOSE ON: FRODO He turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind them.
C: PIPPIN
D: Are we lost?
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: MERRY
D: No. I don't think we are. Shhhh, Gandalf's thinking.
C: PIPPIN
D: Merry!
C: MERRY
D: What?
C: PIPPIN
D: I'm hungry.
N: Frodo's POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the darkness. Frodo is nervous...he approaches Gandalf.
C: FRO DO
D: There's something down there.
E: whispers
C: GANDALF
D: It's Gollum.
E: quietly
C: FRODO
D: Gollum!
C: GANDALF
D: He's been following us for three days.
N: TEASING SHOT: and emaciated, leering creature.
C: FRODO
D: He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?
E: disbelieving
C: GANDALF
D: Escaped...or was set loose. And now the Ring has drawn him here...he will never be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story. Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise.
C: GANDALF
D: Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before the ring came to him, before it drove him mad.
E: CONT'D
N: Gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is large, Luminous eyes blinking with malice. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2)
C: FRODO
D: It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.
E: grim
C: GANDALF
D: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.
C: GANDALF
D: Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment...even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.
E: CONT'D
C: FRODO
D: I wish the ring had never come to me...I wish none of this had happened.
C: GANDALF
D: So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There is a note of finality in Gandalf's voice.
C: GANDALF
D: There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In which case, you also were meant to have it...and that is an encouraging thought, Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship scramble to their feet.
E: CONT'D sudden brightness
C: MERRY
D: He's remembered!
E: relieved
C: GANDALF
D: No, but the air doesn't smell so foul down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose! Ye s...
E: laughs
S: INT. DWAROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA -- DAY
N: The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and empty space. Gandalf pauses...
C: GALADRIEL
D: Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf taps his staff...for a brief moment a light
N: blazes... like a silent Flash of Lightning. Great shadows spring up and flee...
C: GANDALF
D: Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief sight of a vast roof, far above
N: their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone. Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls, polished and smooth as glass.
C: SAM
D: Well, there's an eye opener and no mistake!
N: Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. Black arrows are embedded in the timbers. Two goblin skeletons lie in the doorway. Gimli rushes ahead...
C: GANDALF
D: Gimli!!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BALIN'S TOMB, MORIA -- DAY
N: Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber... lit with a narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near the roof. Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high. In the far corner sits a stone walled Well. A shaft of light falls directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great slab of white stone. Gimli falls to his knees...
C: GIMLI
D: No...no...oh, no!
N: Gimli sobs. Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto the white stone slab. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: GANDALF
D: "Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had feared.
N: Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed...and appears to be covered in Dried Blood. The pages crack and break as he opens it...
C: LEGOLAS
D: We must move on, we cannot linger.
E: urgent whisper to Argorn
C: GANDALF
D: "They have taken the Bridge and the second hall: we have barred the gates...but cannot hold them for long...the ground shakes...drums in the deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. Will no- one save us? They are coming."
E: reading
N: Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton tumbling in! Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin before he falls. The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing loudly!
S: INT. MORIA CAVERNS -- DAY
N: Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin.
C: GANDALF
D: Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time and rid us of your stupidity!
E: angry
N: ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, CHASTENED. They fall silent. A low rolling boom rises from the depths below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of Moria were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts nearby...Answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries... Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt...
C: SAM
D: Mr. Frodo!
E: worried
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing blade!
C: LEGOLAS
D: Orcs !
C: ARAGORN
D: Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.
E: to the hobbits
N: Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in his eyes.
C: BOROMIR
D: They have a cave troll!
N: Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb.
C: GIMLI
D: Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath!
E: yelling
N: BOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in 2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits! Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles backwards...the huge club descends for the killing blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back, spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it too, drops.
C: SAM
D: I think I'm getting the hang of this.
N: The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest with his spear.
C: FRODO
D: Aragorn! Aragorn!
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip and slammed against the wall.
C: ARAGORN
D: Frodo!!
E: shocked yell
N: The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee, bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits looking horrified... Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge breath.
C: SAM
D: He's alive!
C: FRODO
D: I'm alright. I'm not hurt.
C: ARAGORN
D: You should be dead. That spear would've skewered a wild boar!
C: GANDALF
D: I think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye.
N: Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest. The Troll Spear did not pierce the mithril."
C: GIMLI
D: Mithril! You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.
N: BOOM. BOOM. BOOM the sound of the drums rings out again! Gandalf turns to the others.
C: GANDALF
D: To the bridge of Khazad-dum!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DWAROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA -- DAY
N: Gandalf leads the fellowship into the huge Dwarrowdelf Chamber.
C: GANDALF
D: This way!
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: They hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches! Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army that's rushing toward them! SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway... the pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. They back Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the darkness.
C: BOROMIR
D: What is this new devilry?
N: A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles...
C: GANDALF
D: A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world! This foe is beyond any of you! Run! Quickly!
E: quietly urgent yell
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STAIRWAY OF KHASAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY
N: The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great 40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.
C: GANDALF
D: Lead them on, Aragorn. The bridge is near.
N: Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him.
C: GANDALF
D: Do as I say; swords are no more use here.
E: CONT'D
N: THE FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up Frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm. A NARROW BRIDGE, spanning a bottomless pit...Gandalf yells to the others: Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm.

D: Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes through the wall and spreads its vast wings.

C: GANDALF
D: Over the bridge! Fly!
E: yelling
N: They race towards the slender bridge of stone...without kerb or rail...at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge..but Gandalf... the last..pauses in the middle of the span...he faces the Balrog...staff in one hand...Sword in the other! Frodo looks back in horror:
C: GANDALF
D: You cannot pass!
E: CONT'D
C: FRODO
D: Gandalf!
E: alarmed yell
C: GANDALF
D: I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.
E: yelling
N: Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall. Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow bridge.
C: GANDALF
D: Go back to the shadow! The BALROG slashes at Gandalf with its Sword of
E: CONT'D
N: flame...Gandalf blocks with his sword...a ringing clash and the Balrog's sword shatters into molten fragments!
C: GANDALF
D: You shall not pass!! The Balrog places one foot onto the bridge. Aragorn and Boromir race forward, swords drawn.
E: CONT'D booming
N: GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons up his LAST RESERVES OF STRENGTH! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of white flame springs up... the staff shatters...the bridge breaks... right at Balrog's feet. The stone bridge drops away into the gulf...from under the Balrog. For a moment, the great Beast remains poised in the air...then it plunges down: in slow motion Relief floods Frodo's face..Gandalf remains trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. Slow motion: As the Balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire... Slow motion: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around Gandalf's knees, dragging him over the brink! Gandalf just manages to hand on by his fingertips
C: FRODO
D: Gandalf!
E: screaming

N: Aragorn scours ahead of the company, as they stumble on in the fading light...in the distance the shimmer of a large forest can be seen...Lothlorien!
S: EXT. EDGE OF LOTHLORIEN--DUSK
N: WIDE ON: The fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with yellow flowers..above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by silver pillars...the trunks of huge, grey trees. Gimli looks nervously around...
C: GIMLI
D: Stay close, young hobbits..they say a Sorceress lives in these woods. An elf- witch of terrible power. All who look upon her fall under her spell...

D: Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox!
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: The FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES. Deadly arrows aimed at their heads. HALDIR, the Elvish captain steps forward... he looks at Gimli with disdain.
C: HALDIR
D: The dwarf breathes so loud we could have shot him in the dark.
C: ARAGORN
D: Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your help. We need your protection.
E: Elvish: with subtitles

S: EXT. LOTHLORIEN HILLTOP -- DAY
N: Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a Hill Top. They look with wonderment at the vista spread before them. Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees, taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the mallorns is a Beautiful City. It Gleams in the low rays of the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. To the east of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale gleam of Anduin, the great river. Beyond the River, the land appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away, it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie beyond.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CELEBORN'S CHAMBER, CARAS GALADHON -- NIGHT
N: ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless, unsurpassed beauty. Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn...
C: CELEBORN
D: Eight there are, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with him.
N: Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn.
C: GALADRIEL
D: ...he has fallen into shadow. Galadriel looks to Aragorn.
E: V.O. softly aloud
C: GALADRIEL
D: The Quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope remains while the company is true.
E: CONT'D
N: Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam.
C: GALADRIEL
D: Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. Galadriel's eyes turn to Frodo...her voice fades.
E: CONT'D

N: Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam are in a pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them. MOURNFUL SINGING drifts down from the trees above.
C: LEGOLAS
D: A lament for Gandalf...
E: sadly
C: MERRY
D: What do they say about him?
C: LEGOLAS
D: I have not the heart to tell you. For me, the grief is still too near. Boromir is sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him.
C: ARAGORN
D: Take some rest..these borders are well protected.
N: Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face. Aragorn kneels down beside him.
C: BOROMIR
D: I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head...she spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor, and she said to me: "Even now, there
C: BOROMIR
D: is hope left. But I cannot see it...it is long since we had any hope.
E: CONT'D
N: CLOSE ON: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair.
C: BOROMIR
D: My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing and our..our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right...and I would do it, I would see the glory of Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it, Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver, its banners caught high in the morning breeze...have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?
E: CONT'D
C: ARAGORN
D: I have seen the white city..long ago.
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes heart,
C: BOROMIR
D: One day our paths will lead us there, and the tower guards shall take up the call "the Lords of Gondor have returned."
N: Aragorn returns Boromir's smile...betraying his disquiet sadness only when Boromir looks away.
T: CUT TO:
N: LATER.... The Fellowship are asleep on their beds. Gimli is snoring loudly. CLOSE ON: BARE FEET tread soundlessly across the lawn. CLOSE ON: Frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by instinct. GALADRIEL, her White dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her...as if drawn by an invisible force.

N: Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits a shallow Silver Basin. Galadriel leads Frodo into the small Glade.
C: GALADRIEL
D: Will you look into the mirror? Frodo looks with apprehension at the silver basin.
C: FRODO
D: What will I see?
E: warily
N: Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug...a glow rises from the water.
C: GALADRIEL
D: Even the wisest cannot tell for the mirror shows many things...things that were ..things that are...and some things that have not yet come to pass.
N: Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers into the glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into the water... suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure of an old man, clad in white robes. He walks down a long road. Frodo leans closer to the mirror's surface... CLOSE ON: GANDALF LIFTS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS DIRECTLY AT FRODO! FRODO gasps, his face lighting up with hope.
C: FRODO
D: Gandalf!
E: joyous
N: Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity. Frodo reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror. Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. The vision shifts...Frodo gasps in horror! The Shire is in ruins! The image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames! The Party tree is hacked down. Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing him entirely. IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland! The fields and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching smoke! IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the Factories! We see Sam...Merry... and Rosie Cotton. Soot- stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell- hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable to move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire erupts around the eye... With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his senses...he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue, unmoved, untouched by the horror.
C: GALADRIEL
D: I know what it is you saw...for it is also in my mind. It is the future, Frodo. It is what will come to pass if you should fail.
N: Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely...Frodo looks down...in his hand he is clutching the ring. Frodo looks up at Galadriel.
C: GALADRIEL
D: The fellowship is breaking. It has already begun. He will try to take the ring. You know of whom I speak. One by one, it will destroy them all.
E: CONT'D
C: FRODO
D: If you ask it of me, I will give you the One Ring.
E: V.O.
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: GALADRIEL
D: You offer it to me freely...I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.
N: Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's eyes. Frodo is suddenly afraid of her.
C: GALADRIEL
D: In place of the Dark Lord, you would have a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous as the Sea! Stronger than the foundations of the earth...all shall love me and despair! Frodo takes a step away from Galadriel...
E: CONT'D
N: Galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender Elf-woman once more, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.
C: GALADRIEL
E: CONT'D gently
C: I pass the test.
D: I will diminish and go into the west and remain Galadriel. Frodo's confidence drains away.
E: laughs
C: FRODO
D: I cannot do this alone...
C: GALADRIEL
D: You are the ring-bearer, Frodo...to bear a ring of power is to be alone. This task was appointed to you, and if you do not find a way, no one will.
N: Frodo realizes what her message is.
C: FRODO
D: Then I know what I must do. It's just...I'm afraid to do it. Galadriel kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at him intently.
C: GALADRIEL
D: Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
N: The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand...his fingers close over it.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ORTHANC CHAMBER -- DAY
N: Naked, Lurtz's eyes follow Saruman, alight with a mean intelligence.
C: SARUMAN
D: They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark Powers ... tortured and mutilated...a ruined and terrible form of life. And now...perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai. Whom do you serve?
E: V.O. smiles
C: LURTZ
D: Saruman.
E: gutteral rasp
S: INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- DAY
N: QUICK CUTS: LURTZ is quickly armored...Breastplate...Leg guards, Helmet...a sword is thrust in Lurtz's hand. The URUK- HAI are smearing themselves in white paint...a creepy ritualistic ceremony...the white hand of Isengard is smeared on bodies, faces, and armor. SARUMAN address a crowd of 200 fully armed URUK-HAI.
C: SARUMAN
D: Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are found. You do not know pain. You do not know fear. You will taste man-flesh. Saruman turns to Lurtz.
C: SARUMAN
D: One of the Halflings carries something of great value...bring him to me...alive and unspoiled...kill the others.
E: CONT'D coldly
S: EXT. ISENGARD -- DAY
N: Lurtz is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of Isengard..they run fast, their powerful legs carrying them at speed.
S: EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK--DAWN
N: The Fellowship are in small elven boats. They row away from the Lothlorien Shore into the Silverlode river. Elves quietly watch them depart. Galadriel gives Frodo a small Crystal Phial.
C: GALADRIEL
D: Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the light of Earendil, our most beloved star.
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: As the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone, watching from the banks of the river. In his head, Frodo still hears her voice...
C: GALADRIEL
D: May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY
N: The boats pass into the great river Anduin. The Three Elven boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees slowly give way to a brown and withered land.
S: EXT. FOREST -- DAY
N: The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly purpose.
S: EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY
N: A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale sky. Aragorn watches them with concern.
S: EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN--DAWN
N: The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky gorge in the Pre-dawn light. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly paddling in the stern.
C: ARAGORN
D: Frodo.
E: quietly
N: Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Wide on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power and majesty.
C: ARAGORN
D: The Argonath...
E: CONT'D
N: Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself.
C: ARAGORN
D: Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old...my kin.
E: CONT'D deeply moved
N: The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Wide on: Craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to reveal a large lake only a mile down river...
S: EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY
N: ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded shore.
C: ARAGORN
D: We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the boats and continue on foot..we approach Mordor from the North.
C: GIMLI
D: Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And after that gets even better...a festering, stinking marshland, far as the eye can see.
E: gloomy
C: ARAGORN
D: That is our Road...I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.
C: GIMLI
D: Recover my...
E: indignant
N: Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency.
C: LEGOLAS
D: We should leave now.
C: ARAGORN
D: No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.
C: LEGOLAS
D: It is not the Eastern shore that worries me.
N: Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest...
C: LEGOLAS
D: A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. Something draws near, I can feel it.
E: CONT'D
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means. Sam has slumped asleep...Merry dumps a small pile of kindling at Gimli's feet...
C: MERRY
D: Where's Frodo?
N: Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp bed. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN.... as he realizes Boromir has gone!
S: EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN -- DAY
N: Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. His feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat. A CRACKLING SOUND! Frodo freezes....
C: BOROMIR
D: None of us should wander alone; you least of all. So much depends on you...Frodo?
E: quietly
N: Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious.
C: BOROMIR
D: I know why you seek solitude. You suffer, I see it day by day. Are you sure you do not suffer needlessly?
E: CONT'D
N: Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be heard
C: BOROMIR
D: Let me help you. There are other ways, Frodo..other paths that we might take.
E: CONT'D
C: FRODO
D: I know what you would say, and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.
C: BOROMIR
D: Warning? Against what?
N: Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself up. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: BOROMIR
D: We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have...don't you see that is madness?
E: CONT'D
C: FRODO
D: There is no other way.
C: BOROMIR
D: I ask only for the strength to defend my people. If you would but lend me the ring...
E: angrily drops the wood he has collected
C: FRODO
D: No. . .
N: Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.
C: BOROMIR
D: Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
C: FRODO
D: You are not yourself.
E: wary
C: BOROMIR
D: What chance do you think you have? They will find you, they will take the ring and you will beg for death before the end.
N: Frodo turns to leave.
C: BOROMIR
D: You fool! It is not yours save by unhappy chance...it might have been mine. It should be mine. Give it to me! Give me the ring.
E: CONT'D
N: Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring! Frodo has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his neck..and rams it on his finger.
C: FRODO DISAPPEARS
D: Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into thin air!
C: BOROMIR
D: I see your mind...you will take the ring to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to your death and the death of us all.
E: MORE CONTINUED
C: CONTINUED: BOROMIR
D: Curse you! Curse you and your Halflings! Boromir stumbles and falls. His body shakes as if in the Throes of a fit...slowly he comes to.
E: 2 CONT'D
C: BOROMIR
D: Frodo! Frodo! What have I done. Please, Frodo...
E: CONT'D Disoriented
S: EXT. SEEING SEAT -- DAY
N: IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD: FRODO races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir's distraught voice carries from another dimension:
C: BOROMIR
D: I'm sorry, Frodo...Frodo...
E: O.S.
N: Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the throne of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around him. Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to shrink. In all directions, Views of far off lands telescope towards him through the mist. IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of holes in the misty mountains... flames rising from Mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships sailing into the south. All the power of the Dark Lord is in motion. Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills Frodo's vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong, tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON! SUDDENLY! SAURON'S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF LIGHT. SAURON (V.O.) (IN BLACK SPEECH) They will fall! Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down the stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight, seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring off his finger...
S: EXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN -- DAY
N: Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below the ancient ruins of the seeing seat. AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT! Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him.
C: ARAGORN
D: Frodo?
C: FRODO
D: It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves towards Frodo...
E: numb
C: ARAGORN
D: Where is the ring?
E: urgent
N: Frodo backs away from Aragorn...Aragorn is shocked by the movement.
C: FRODO
D: Stay away!
C: ARAGORN
D: Frodo...I swore to protect you.
C: FRODO
D: Can you protect me from yourself?
N: Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! It glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's eyes are drawn to it.
C: FRODO
D: Would you destroy it?
E: CONT'D
C: ARAGORN
D: I would have gone with you to the end... into the very fires of Mordor.
E: kneeling to Frodo
C: FRODO
D: I know...Look after the others, especially Sam...he will not understand.
N: Aragorn freezes! He draws his sword.
C: ARAGORN
D: Go, Frodo!
E: urgent
N: Frodo hesitates. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: ARAGORN
D: Run! Run!!
E: CONT'D yells
N: Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto Amon Hen behind Aragorn! Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... he brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as others close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside, away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, he is quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow. Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.
S: EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE -- DAY
N: Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet thunder down behind him.
C: SAM
D: Mr. Frodo!
N: Sam looks around for Frodo. CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his URUKS.
C: LURTZ
D: Find the Halflings ... find the halflings!
N: Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the forest rings out.
C: MERRY
D: Frodo!
E: O.S. urgent whisper
N: Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few feet away.
C: MERRY
D: Hide here, quick!
E: CONT'D
C: PIPPIN
D: Come on...
N: Frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a great sadness in his eyes...
C: PIPPIN
D: What's he doing?
E: CONT'D
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Merry's eyes meet Frodo's. Understanding.
C: MERRY
D: He's leaving.
E: softly
C: PIPPIN
D: No!
N: Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo...Merry grabs at his arm.
C: MERRY
D: Pippin!
N: THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towards the lake.
C: LEGOLAS
D: The horn of Gondor!
C: ARAGORN
D: Boromir!
N: Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling URUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear guard action. MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he tries to protect Merry and Pippin...
C: BOROMIR
D: Run! Run!
N: Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.
C: MERRY & PIPPIN
D: Aaaaagh! Boromir! Boromir!
N: Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart... suddenly Aragorn charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lock into a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI arrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAI lie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Cloven in two.
C: BOROMIR
D: They took the little ones...
E: painful gasp MORE
N: (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED: BOROMIR

E: 2 CONT'D

D: Frodo...where is Frodo?
E: CONT'D panicked
C: ARAGORN
D: I let Frodo go.
N: Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze.
C: BOROMIR
D: Then you did what I could not. I tried to take the ring from him.
C: ARAGORN
D: The ring is beyond our reach now.
C: BOROMIR
D: Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed you all.
C: ARAGORN
D: No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to bind Boromir's wound.
C: BOROMIR
D: Leave it! It is over...the world of Men will fall and all will come to darkness and my city to ruin..Aragorn..
C: ARAGORN
D: I do not know what strength is in my blood, but I swear to you... I will not let the White City fall, nor your people fail...
C: BOROMIR
D: Our people...our people...
N: Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand. Boromir's fingers tighten around the hilt.
C: BOROMIR
D: I would have followed you, my brother...my captain, my King. Aragorn lays Boromir down. He is dead.

S: EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY
N: On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish Boats, the ring in his palm. A distraught Sam...running as hard as he can through the forest...
C: SAM
D: Mr. Frodo!
N: Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...the camera moves in on the ring.
C: FRODO
D: I wish the ring had never come to me..I wish none of this had happened...
E: V.O.
N: Tears fall down Frodo's face...
C: GANDALF
D: So do all who lie to see such times...but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
E: V.O.
N: With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish boat into the water... Sam bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.
C: SAM
D: Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in the boat, paddling steadfastly away from the

C: FRODO
D: Sam!
E: CONT'D frightened
N: Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks. Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's... Frodo pulls a bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat. Frodo and Sam look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming down both their faces.

D: Come on then..
E: CONT'D
N: The two Hobbits row through the water...
S: EXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL -- DAY
N: Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing water...Boromir's body slides under camera. He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his chest..his broken horn at his side. Suddenly... the boat drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: LEGOLAS
D: If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and Sam before nightfall.
N: Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and Sam make off into the forest beyond. He doesn't react. Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn.

D: You mean not to follow them...
E: CONT'D

D: Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.
C: GIMLI
