M: SHOOTING DRAFT
S: EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL INTERPLANETARY SPACE
N: A vast field of stars. The gas giant Neptune slowly spins into view. Brilliant and blue and cold against the void.
S: EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL A BLACK SILHOUETTE
N: stands out against the planet, tiny against Neptune's scale.
S: EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL DRIFT CLOSER
N: to discern the hard angles of a man-made craft. A ship. No longer dwarfed by the planet, the scale of the vessel emerges: a vast labyrinth of steel. Its shadow swallows all in darkness.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY
N: Shafts of Neptune's blue light enter through windows, illuminate debris suspended in the zero-gravity environment: shards of metal and glass. MOVE from the Corridor into:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: A cockpit for three. Neptune's blue light fills the chamber, reflects off immobile particles in the air. Thick quartz windows look down at Neptune. The cockpit lights are dark but for one blinking red light. An emergency beacon. Under-floor lights go on. The strobe of the red light reveals a man floating at the helm, slowly spinning. He is dead, perfectly preserved in the cold vacuum of space. His eyes are empty black pits and his mouth hangs open in a scream: DR. WILLIAM WEIR.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT
N: Weir opens his eyes, waking from dream. Sweat beads his ascetic, etched face. Many years a scientist. He turns on the bedside lamp, revealing a couple's apartment. Decorated by a woman, but Weir is alone, unless you count photographs. His nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful woman. Weir reaches to the stand. Picks up... RECENT, UNFRAMED PHOTO The woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave smile. Weir lies back on the bed. Looks at the photo. Presses it to his forehead and closes his eyes. Trying to be with her, just one more time.
C: WEIR
D: I miss you.
E: whisper
S: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER
N: Weir stands in front of the bathroom mirror, shaving with a straight-razor. The mirror reveals the bathtub just behind him. DRIP, DRIP, DRIP... Weir turns to stare at the bathtub. Water wells up at the mouth of the tub's faucet, grows impossibly large, falls... DRIP. Weir turns back to his shaving.
S: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER
N: Weir stands in the kitchenette, staring at the microwave as it cooks his breakfast.
S: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER
N: Weir stands before his window, chewing his oatmeal mechanically, forcing himself to swallow. He reaches out to open the blinds...
S: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT REVERSE ANGLE
N: as the blinds pull aside, revealing Weir, upside-down. ROTATE AND PULL BACK...
S: EXT. DAYLIGHT STATION - MODEL TO REVEAL DAYLIGHT STATION
N: Weir's window is just one of many in a space station, a delicate combination of cylindrical habitats and solar panels. The structure hangs above the Earth in low orbit. TITLE CARD: DAYLIGHT SPACE STATION 08.23.2046
S: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT (BLINDS OPEN)
N: A videophone RINGS OS...
C: WEIR
D: This is Weir.
E: V.O.
C: LYLE
D: Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
E: V.O. tinny
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DAYLIGHT - OFFICE
N: A military office, United States Aerospace Command seal blazoned on the door. Views of the Earth. Admiral HOLLIS sits behind his desk, a gruff career officer and a good man. Weir enters, escorted by Hollis' adjutant, LYLE.
C: WEIR
D: You wanted to see me, Admiral?
C: HOLLIS
D: I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
S: INT. HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
N: Lyle activates a holographic display of the solar system. A box magnifies the eighth planet, Neptune, revealing a flashing red dot in its orbit.
S: INT. DAYLIGHT OFFICE
C: LYLE
D: At oh-three-hundred this morning, TDRSS picked up an automated navigation beacon broadcasting at two minute intervals in Neptune orbit.
N: Lyle hands Weir a stack of hardcopy data. Weir reads the data with growing excitement.
C: WEIR
D: Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
C: HOLLIS
D: I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
C: WEIR
D: It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
E: excited
N: Hollis answers drily.
C: HOLLIS
D: That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible. Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage. We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
E: beat beat
C: WEIR
D: A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
N: Lyle looks at Weir, stunned by the request.
C: LYLE
D: Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
C: WEIR
D: I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
C: LYLE
D: I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
C: WEIR
D: This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all! The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream. I have to go.
E: beat, passionate beat, quiet and relentless
C: HOLLIS
D: It's not that simple. Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
E: off of Weir's expression
C: LYLE
D: Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
N: Lyle presses a button on Hollis' desk. An unholy GARBLE rips from office speakers: STATIC and NOISE and INHUMAN VOICES. Alone, each sound would raise the hair on your neck. Together, they are unbearable. The sound mercifully cuts off to STATIC. Lyle stops the tape. Weir sits there, stunned.
C: LYLE
D: Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
C: WEIR
D: The crew? Could they still be alive?
C: LYLE
D: The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
C: WEIR
D: Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
N: Hollis stares at Weir, judging the man with his eyes.
C: HOLLIS
D: It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
C: WEIR
D: Thank you.
C: HOLLIS
D: Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
N: Weir leaves. The door closes behind him.
C: LYLE
D: You're not seriously considering sending him?
C: HOLLIS
D: You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
C: LYLE
D: The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
C: HOLLIS
D: That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
C: LYLE
D: Does he know that?
C: HOLLIS
D: What's on your mind?
C: LYLE
D: He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it. And then there's his wife.
E: beat
C: HOLLIS
D: It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
C: LYLE
D: Some things you don't get over.
N: Beat.
C: HOLLIS
D: I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
C: LYLE
D: The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DAYLIGHT STATION/EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK
N: The Lewis and Clark pulls away from Daylight station, turns towards the depths of space. It is a tough-looking spacecraft, all engine. Sequence omitted from original script.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: MOVE IN on thick quartz windows near the ship's nose: the bridge... Split level. Above: avionics, navigation, flight control. STARCK (female, Navigator, sharp mind, sharp tongue) checks the navigation data on her screen as SMITH (male, Pilot, wrapped too tight) punches in the course.
C: SMITH
D: I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
C: STARCK
D: Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
N: The captain's chair drops from above, swivels to reveal MILLER (male, Captain, intense).
C: MILLER
D: I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
C: SMITH
D: Locked and cocked.
C: STARCK
D: We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
C: MILLER
D: Justin?
N: Below: the bridge's "war-room" -- ship's systems and mission stations. JUSTIN (male, Engineer, young hot-shot).
C: JUSTIN
D: Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
C: MILLER
D: Start the countdown.
C: STARCK
D: Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
C: MILLER
D: Let's go.
N: Miller slides down a ladder into the war-room. The others follow into...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY
N: Bulky EVA (extra-vehicular activity) suits line the walls. MUSIC blares from a JAMBOX, built into a storage locker. An Emergency Tech stows safety lines: COOPER -- male, the resident pain-in-the-ass. He SINGS along with the music.
C: MILLER
D: Kill it.
E: not breaking stride
N: Cooper reaches up, turns off the box.
C: COOPER
D: Time to play Spam in the can.
C: MILLER
D: Don't start with me, Cooper.
N: Cooper falls in as the crew continues into...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS
N: Evidence of long term habitation. Personalized lockers. Fold- down bunks, chairs, tables; currently stowed for docking. A modular galley. PETERS (female, Emergency Technician, the crew's denmother) and DJ (male, Doctor, a cold perfectionist) load CO2 scrubbers into a bin in the floor. Weir stands to the side like a fifth wheel.
C: WEIR
D: Captain Miller, I just want to say...
C: MILLER
D: The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
N: Weir hesitates, then follows the crew into Medical. Miller hangs back.
C: MILLER
D: What's the hold up?
C: PETERS
D: Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers. Good for four months.
E: to Miller, accusatory
C: MILLER
D: I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
C: PETERS
D: No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer. Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
E: beat
C: MILLER
D: I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL
N: A high tech operating room. Modular equipment. Vertical tanks line the walls, each large enough to hold a human being: gravity couches. The crew stands before the gravity couches, almost nude, no room for modesty. Starck catches Cooper looking at her ass as she strips to her undergarments. Cooper grins. She flips him off, not bothering to turn around.
C: COOPER
D: Is that an offer?
C: STARCK
D: It is not.
N: Miller disrobes. Two service tags hang around his neck. He does not remove them. Weir approaches him.
C: WEIR
D: Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
C: MILLER
D: Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
C: WEIR
D: I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
C: MILLER
D: Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
N: Weir nods, moves to an empty couch bearing his name, written on a piece of tape. Peters watches him.
C: PETERS
D: First time in a grav couch?
C: WEIR
D: Yes.
N: She checks Weir's couch, helps him climb in. Weir keeps one eye on Miller.
C: PETERS
D: Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
E: Off of Weir's glance
C: WEIR
D: He's been past Mars?
C: PETERS
D: He served on the Goliath.
C: WEIR
D: Wasn't that ship destroyed?
C: PETERS
D: They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
E: nods
C: DJ
D: He doesn't like to talk about it.
E: interrupting
N: DJ swathes one of Weir's arms with alcohol.
C: DJ
D: You didn't eat anything in the past twelve hours?
N: Weir shakes his head.
C: DJ
D: When the Ion drive fires, we'll be taking about 30 gees. Without a tank, the force would liquefy your skeleton.
N: DJ injects Weir. The scientist winces.
C: WEIR
D: I've seen the effect on mice.
N: The overhead lights change to red.
C: MILLER
D: Five minutes.
N: DJ hands him the breathing mask.
C: DJ
D: Put this on.
N: Weir does. DJ checks the fit.
C: PETERS
D: You'll be fine. You'll wake up and we'll be there. Watch your fingers.
N: DJ closes the tank. It begins to fill with green gel. Weir's eyes grow large with fear and then the anaesthesia hits. His eyes close. His body draws into a fetal position.
C: DJ
D: Heart-rate decreasing... body temp dropping to 80... 70... 60... 50... 40 degrees Fahrenheit. He's in stasis.
E: checking the monitor
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL
N: THE ION ENGINE at the aft of the ship begins to glow a deep red.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL
N: The crew hang inert in the gravity couches.
S: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL
N: SILENCE. The engine flares white hot. The Lewis and Clark lances forward.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - INTERPLANETARY SPACE - MODEL
N: The Lewis and Clark races SILENTLY past. The engine at its aft holds a sustained fusion reaction like the sun. GRAPHIC: U.S.S. Lewis and Clark. 56 days out.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL CLOSE ON WEIR
N: immobile in the grav tank. He might be sleeping. He might be dead. A distant SOUND echoes though the ship, the unholy garble of human and inhuman voices -- it is the Event Horizon, calling to him -- the sound refines into a WOMAN'S VOICE, no more than a WHISPER:
C: VOICE
D: Billy...
N: Weir opens his eyes.
C: VOICE
D: I'm so cold...
N: Weir's grav tank opens. WIDER TO REVEAL the seven bodies of the crew, suspended inert in the gel. A sound: DRIP... DRIP... DRIP... Weir slowly walks to the Bridge.
C: VOICE
D: I'm so cold...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: A naked WOMAN sits at the helm, her back to us. Completely still. Her skin is very pale. Water pools around her chair. Weir stands behind her.
C: WEIR
D: Claire?
E: tentative
N: She does not answer. She does not move. Weir reaches out to touch her shoulder, then pulls his hand back, afraid.
C: WEIR
D: Claire? I'm sorry. Claire?
N: He reaches out again. He touches her hair. She doesn't move. Weir catches her reflection in the computer monitors. Something wrong with her face... He starts to spin her around.
C: CLAIRE
D: I'm so cold...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL
N: Weir awakes with a jolt, in his grav couch. His mask has slipped. His tank has filled with blood. He is drowning.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL
N: Reality. Weir's eyes open. He presses against the glass of the tank, trying to force it open, panicked. The others are already stepping from open tanks. Weir's tank opens with a HISS. He tumbles to the floor, gasping, fluid streaming from his mouth. Peters rushes to him.
C: WEIR
D: Claire...
E: gasping
C: PETERS DJ!
D: It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
E: to Weir
N: Weir catches his breath. He looks up. The crew surrounds him, concerned.
C: WEIR
D: I'm alright now. I'm alright...
N: DJ helps him to his feet.
C: DJ
D: Move slowly. You've been in stasis for fifty-six days. You're going to experience a little disorientation.
N: Weir nods.
C: COOPER
D: Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
C: WEIR
D: What?
C: COOPER
D: Coffee.
C: WEIR
D: No, thank you.
N: Cooper, still butt-naked and proud of it, grabs a metal cylinder from the wall and pours a mug for himself.
C: COOPER
D: Hey, Starck. You wanna dry my back?
N: Starck gives him a cool once over.
C: STARCK
D: Maybe when you finish puberty.
N: Miller zips up.
C: MILLER
D: Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
C: STARCK
D: I just finished drying...
C: MILLER
D: Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go! And Cooper... Put some pants on.
E: to Cooper
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. INTERPLANETARY SPACE - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL
N: SILENCE. The Lewis and Clark drifts towards Neptune.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS
N: The crew has secured the quarters from flight status. Bunks have been folded down, each alcove personalized with photographs and pin-ups. DJ moves around the cabin, checking the crew's radiation badges. Cooper and Justin sit on their bunks, tossing a handball across the cabin. Peters holds a "Watchman" video unit, watching a "video letter"...
S: EXT. PETERS HOME - GARDEN (DENNY'S PARTY)
N: ...from DENNY, her four-year-old son, a paraplegic, grinning widely in his new wheelchair:
C: DENNY
D: Play horsey, Mommy, play horsey...
E: video
N: IN THE VIDEO, Peters enters shot, scoops her child from the chair.
C: PETERS
D: Want to play horsey, do you...
E: video etc.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARKE - QUARTERS
N: Weir sits huddled in a blanket. Miller takes a seat next to him. Starck and Smith enter. Starck sits next to Miller.
C: SMITH
D: 30 hours to Neptune orbit.
C: STARCK
D: All boards are green, everything's five by five.
C: MILLER
D: That's good to know. Justin, you wanna stow that?
N: Justin catches the ball, holds onto it.
C: MILLER
D: Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
C: COOPER
D: You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
C: MILLER
D: This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
C: JUSTIN
D: Ballast.
C: COOPER
D: I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
E: to Weir
C: MILLER
D: He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
C: DJ
D: Trauma.
C: MILLER
D: And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
N: Miller and the crew look at Weir, waiting. Weir clears his throat.
C: WEIR
D: What I am about to tell you is considered code-black by the NSA.
N: The crew look at each other: they haven't heard that in a mission briefing before.
C: JUSTIN
D: That means top-secret, Cooper.
C: COOPER
D: I heard it.
C: WEIR
D: The USAC intercepted a radio transmission from a decaying orbit around Neptune. The source has been identified as the Event Horizon.
N: STUNNED SILENCE. Then everyone talks at once:
C: STARCK
D: That's impossible! She was lost with all hands, what, seven...
C: JUSTIN
D: Seven years ago, the reactor blew...
C: PETERS
D: How can we salvage...?
C: SMITH
D: Let the dead rest, man...
C: COOPER
D: ...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
C: MILLER
D: EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
N: In the quiet that follows:
C: WEIR
D: What was made public about the Event Horizon, that she was a deep space research vessel, that its reactor went critical, that the ship blew up... None of that is true. The Event Horizon was the culmination of a secret government project to create a spacecraft capable of faster- than-light flight.
E: beat
N: The crew stares at Weir: he has just dropped another bomb on them.
C: SMITH
D: You can't do that.
C: STARCK
D: The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
C: WEIR
D: Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
C: STARCK
D: How?
C: WEIR
D: Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
C: COOPER
D: Laymen's terms.
N: Weir thinks of another way to explain it. He rips a pin-up from Smith's locker.
C: SMITH
D: Hey...
C: WEIR
D: Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...
E: marks it on the photo with a pen
C: ...to "point B," here.
D: Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
E: marks point B
N: The crew stares at him. Starck decides to play.
C: STARCK
D: A straight line.
C: WEIR
D: Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
N: Weir folds the paper, lining up point A over point B... then THRUSTING his pen through both, skewering the pin-up.
C: WEIR
D: ...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal. It's called a gravity drive.
E: hands the ruined pin- up back to Smith
C: JUSTIN
D: How do you know all this?
C: WEIR
D: I built it.
N: Even Cooper is impressed.
C: COOPER
D: I can see why they sent you along.
C: JUSTIN
D: So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
C: WEIR
D: It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive. And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace. Until now.
E: beat beat
C: MILLER
D: Where has it been for the last seven years?
C: WEIR
D: That's what we're here to find out.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. INTERPLANETARY SPACE - MODEL
N: The Lewis and Clark flashes silently past, heading deeper and deeper into space.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: The crew assembled.
C: WEIR
D: We haven't been able to confirm any live contact, but TDRSS did receive a single transmission from the Event Horizon.
N: Weir punches a button on a console. The transmission BLARES from the bridge's speakers, STATIC and NOISE and, underneath all, INHUMAN VOICES. The crew listen, look at one another. The recording ends abruptly.
C: SMITH
D: What the hell is that?
C: PETERS
D: It doesn't sound like anything human.
C: WEIR
D: Houston has passed the recording through several filters and isolated what appears to be a human voice.
N: He activates a different file. The resulting WAIL is more human but no less terrifying, a cry of despair. The last message from a drowning man...
C: SMITH
D: Jesus...
C: MILLER
D: What is that?
C: DJ
D: It sounds like Latin.
C: COOPER
D: Latin? Who the fuck speaks Latin?
C: STARCK
D: No one. It's a dead language.
C: DJ
D: Mostly dead.
C: MILLER
D: What does it say?
C: WEIR NSA encryption specialists have
D: deciphered some of the message...
N: Weir plays the HELLISH INCANTATION for a third time.
C: WEIR
D: There: "...liberatis me..." They haven't been able to translate the rest, it's too distorted.
C: DJ
D: "Liberatis me." "Save me."
C: COOPER
D: From what?
C: MILLER
D: You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
E: to Weir
C: WEIR
D: The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
C: COOPER
D: Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
C: MILLER
D: You heard the tape, Smith. We're looking for survivors.
T: CUT TO:

D: Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
C: MILLER
D: Come around to three-three-four...
C: SMITH
D: Heading three-three-four...
E: echoing
C: MILLER
D: ...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...

S: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - NEPTUNE ORBIT - MODEL
N: RCS thrusters pivot and fire as the ship enters Neptune orbit, dropping lower and lower into the dense blue clouds...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: The ship begins to rock as it encounters atmosphere, a growing vibration. GRAPHICS flash across the main window's HUD. Neptune's dark shadow fills the screen.
C: SMITH
D: We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
C: MILLER
D: Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
C: STARCK
D: This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing...
E: into radio she continues B.G.
C: SMITH
D: Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
E: over Starck
C: MILLER
D: We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
C: SMITH
D: That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
C: MILLER
D: What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
C: SMITH
D: Something like that, yeah.
N: Miller grins grimly.
C: MILLER
D: I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
C: SMITH
D: Yes, sir.
C: MILLER
D: Dr. Weir...!
N: Weir sticks his head into the bridge.
C: MILLER
D: I think you want to see this.
N: Weir climbs up the ladder to the flight deck.
C: WEIR
D: Where is she?
C: SMITH
D: Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
N: Suddenly, the ship SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY. Weir braces himself in the doorway, staring out the forward window into the roiling azure clouds. Smith grimaces, his knuckles white at the controls.
C: SMITH
D: We've got some weather.
C: MILLER
D: I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
C: STARCK
D: If they are, they're screening their calls.
C: SMITH
D: Range 3000 meters and closing.
C: WEIR
D: I can't see anything...
N: Only turbid clouds of methane ice whirl past the Lewis and Clark's windows.
C: SMITH
D: 1500 meters. We're getting too close...
C: MILLER
D: Where is it?
C: STARCK
D: The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
E: checking her console
C: SMITH
D: 1000 meters...
N: A red warning light begins to flash in time with a shrill BEEP.
C: SMITH
D: Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
C: MILLER
D: Starck...
C: STARCK
D: It should be right there...
N: She looks up, trails off...
C: STARCK
D: My God.
S: EXT. EVENT HORIZON - AGAINST NEPTUNE - MODEL STARCK'S POV
N: ...the clouds break, revealing... THE EVENT HORIZON, right in front of them. A black labyrinthine blasphemy against Neptune's arctic blue. Cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye of a hurricane.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARKE - BRIDGE
C: MILLER
D: Reverse thrusters full!
S: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - DWARFED BY EVENT HORIZON - MODEL
N: The Event Horizon looms enormous as the Lewis and Clark hangs off the port stern, dwarfed by the giant ship.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: The turbulence subsides. The bridge crew stares at the massive craft. The only sound, the PROXIMITY WARNING. Finally:
C: SMITH
D: Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
C: WEIR
D: She's not ugly.
N: Miller reaches over Smith's shoulder, turns off the proximity warning. Smith snaps back to business.
C: SMITH
D: Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
C: STARCK
D: Picking up magnetic interference.
C: MILLER
D: Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
C: SMITH
D: Love to.
E: he is not
S: EXT. NEPTUNE - LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL
N: The Lewis and Clark maneuvers in close to the Event Horizon, dwarfed by the dark ship.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: Smith keeps a tight hand on the controls. The crew stare out the viewport at the abandoned craft.
C: STARCK
D: Look at the size of that thing.
N: Weir explains the view out the cockpit window.
C: WEIR
D: Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
C: SMITH
D: Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
C: MILLER
D: Do it.
N: Smith grimaces. His hands move carefully over the controls.
S: EXT. NEPTUNE - LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL
N: The Lewis and Clark moves even closer. Vanishing into the shadow of the Event Horizon.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: The crew stares at the ship rushing past the viewport. A huge spherical structure looms eerily ahead.
C: WEIR
D: That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
C: MILLER
D: Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
C: WEIR
D: Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
S: EXT. EVENT HORIZON - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL
N: The Lewis and Clark carefully maneuvers in close to the Event Horizon's airlock. A mechanical boom-arm extends from the smaller ship to latch onto the Event Horizon. Its clawed hand grabs the antennae cluster. The cluster buckles under the stress.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
C: SMITH
D: It is now. We're locked in.
E: to Weir to Miller
C: MILLER
D: Starck, give me a read.
N: A scan of the Event Horizon appears across Starck's screen.
C: STARCK
D: The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
C: WEIR
D: Do they have pressure?
C: STARCK
D: Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
C: MILLER
D: Find 'em, Starck.
N: Starck frowns at her display.
C: STARCK
D: Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
C: MILLER
D: Radiation interference?
C: STARCK
D: There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
C: WEIR
D: Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
C: STARCK
D: If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
C: MILLER
D: Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
C: JUSTIN
D: Yes, sir!
N: Weir starts to follow Justin from the bridge.
C: MILLER
D: Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
C: WEIR
D: Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
C: MILLER
D: Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
C: WEIR
D: That is not acceptable --
E: interrupting
C: MILLER
D: -- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is! I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
E: overlapping beat
N: Weir exhales.
C: WEIR
D: Very well.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL
N: The docking collar umbilicus extends to the Event Horizon's airlock.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY
N: Miller, Peters, Justin and Cooper in EVA; Cooper and Justin, without headgear.
C: COOPER
D: ...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
C: MILLER
D: You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
E: muffled
C: COOPER
D: I'll be all over it.
N: Miller nods to Peters.
C: PETERS
D: Opening inner airlock door.
E: muffled
N: The inner airlock door opens: CH-THUNK. Miller, Peters and Justin enter the airlock. Justin attaches his safety line. Miller and Peters do not.
C: COOPER
D: You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
C: JUSTIN
D: I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
N: Cooper puts Justin's helmet on. It seals tight.
C: COOPER
D: You just keep your nose clean, Baby Bear. Clear the door.
E: serious now
N: Cooper backs out, allowing the inner airlock door to shut, ECHOING through the ship.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS
N: Miller, Peters and Justin float down the brightly lit umbilicus into the Event Horizon, all in EVA suits. Justin's safety line trails out behind him. The OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR of the Event Horizon waits for them.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: Weir has taken over Justin's station. He watches the POV monitors like a kid watching Christmas. Smith and Starck keep tabs over his shoulder.
C: WEIR
D: You've reached the outer airlock door.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS
N: Peters attaches a thumper -- a device using sound waves to measure pressure -- to the inner airlock door.
C: PETERS
D: We've got pressure.
C: MILLER
D: Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
N: Peters inserts a zero-G drill into the panel beside the door. The door slowly opens...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS
N: The immense corridor stretches away into darkness in both directions. Distantly spaced windows manifest as remote pools of blue light amidst endless black, adding to the vast sense of scale. The light from their dual spotlights on the team's helmets reflects off tiny ice crystals of frozen atmosphere. They are ants in a tomb built for giants.
C: PETERS
D: Jesus its huge.
C: MILLER
D: Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
C: WEIR
D: You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
E: O.S. radio
C: MILLER
D: Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
C: JUSTIN
D: Not a chance, sir.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS
N: The group separates. Justin kicks off from the wall, shoots down the corridor at immense speed.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS
N: Miller and Peters move in the opposite direction. They use magnetic plates on their boots and gloves to cling to the walls as they slowly make their way down the dark shaft. Their journey seems endless. The darkness almost seems a living thing as it surrounds them.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS
N: Miller spots something at a coupling, where two sections of the corridor join...
C: MILLER
D: Dr. Weir, what's this?
N: Miller indicates a box nestled against the coupling. The universal symbol for explosives is on the cover.
C: PETERS
D: Here's another one. They're all over the place.
E: ahead at the next coupling
C: WEIR
D: They're explosive charges.
E: O.S. radio
C: MILLER
D: I can see that, what're they for?
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
C: WEIR
D: In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS
N: Peters and Miller keep moving.
C: PETERS
D: That means they didn't abandon ship.
C: MILLER
D: So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
C: STARCK
D: I'm running diagnostics now, Skipper... Nothing's wrong with the sensor pack, I'm still getting trace life readings, all over the ship.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS
N: Miller and Peters unconsciously look around. Sweat beads their faces.
C: PETERS
D: There's no one in the corridor but us.
C: STARCK
D: Not according to the computer.
E: O.S. radio
C: MILLER
D: Peters is right, no one's here.
C: PETERS
D: I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
N: She starts to wave her searchlight around wildly.
C: MILLER
D: Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
E: calming her down
C: WEIR
D: Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
E: O.S. radio
C: PETERS
D: I can see the hatch.
C: MILLER
D: Starck, you still showing those readings?
C: STARCK
D: That's an affirmative.
E: O.S. radio
C: MILLER
D: Keep your eyes open.
E: to Peters
N: She nods as he reaches for the hatch...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY
N: The hatch opens, allowing Peters and Miller entrance into the forward decks. These areas were intended for human habitation, and seem similar in design to the Lewis and Clark, only larger. Gravity couches line both walls, eighteen in all. Empty.
C: PETERS
D: We found the gravity couches.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: Weir peers eagerly at the monitors.
C: WEIR
D: Any survivors?
C: MILLER
D: Negative.
E: O.S. radio
N: Hope drains from Weir's face.
C: WEIR
D: No one?
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY
C: MILLER
D: They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
N: Miller and Peters split up, each taking a separate exit from the chamber.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: Weir looks at Justin's POV screen: a grainy image of the First Containment Seal.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR (BY FIRST SEAL)
N: Justin stands before a thick pressure door. Justin checks the door with his thumper, his boots are now on.
C: WEIR
D: You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
E: O.S. radio
C: JUSTIN
D: We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
C: WEIR
D: Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
E: O.S. radio
N: Justin touches a panel beside the door. It opens. He enters...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT
N: ...a long corridor shaped like a tube. It rotates like a turbine, causing vertigo. Justin's BREATH echoes in his helmet as he moves forward...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY
N: Cooper stares at Justin's safety line in the airlock. THE SAFETY LINE counts off silently, passing 150 meters...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE
N: The corridor ends at a pressure door.
C: PETERS
D: Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
C: WEIR
D: You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
E: O.S. radio
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
N: Miller, moving through a deserted lab. Empty operating tables. Stainless steel surgical instruments float in zero-G. A glove floats up behind him, brushes his shoulder. He wheels... the glove is empty. It spins away.
C: MILLER
D: If we saw any crew, Doctor, you'd know about it. I'm in Medical. No casualties, it looks like this place has never been used.
E: looking around
N: He finds a computer console.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE
N: Peters opens the door.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER
N: Peters enters. Looks around: a small antechamber for crew briefings, with chairs and a display table. Red crystals float in a crimson mist around her.
C: PETERS
D: I found something.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: Weir peers at the monitors, trying to make out the red haze.
C: WEIR
D: Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
C: PETERS
D: Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
E: O.S. radio
C: WEIR
D: Can you see a body?
E: nervous
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER
C: PETERS
D: There's no one here.
E: confused
C: MILLER
D: The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
E: O.S. radio
C: PETERS
D: There's no one here, Skipper.
N: Peters takes a sample container from her belt. Carefully tries to capture a suspended crystal...
C: PETERS
D: Come on...
N: CLOSE UP OF THE BLOOD CRYSTAL and the Container; Peters' brow furrowed with concentration. WIDER AS A FLASH OF BLUE LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES THE ROOM, REVEALING... ...THE WALL BEHIND PETERS, CASED IN A FROZEN EXPLOSION OF BLOOD AND TISSUE. Someone died here in a violent and terrible way. Peters starts to look up but the flash dies away. She never saw the horror behind her. Peters turns her attention back to her tiny crystal. She traps the it, returns the container to her belt. She moves from the antechamber into...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Her helmet lights sweep the room. Every surface a control panel.
C: PETERS
D: Okay. I'm on the bridge.
C: MILLER
D: What you got, Peters?
E: O.S. radio
N: Peters examines the other consoles -- most are dark but for a few dim lights.
C: PETERS
D: Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
C: MILLER
D: The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: Weir stares at Peters' monitor.
C: WEIR
D: Ms. Peters, turn back and to your left, please.
N: On her monitor, Peters' POV shifts as she complies.
C: STARCK
D: What is it?
C: WEIR
D: Ship's log.
C: PETERS
D: I see it.
E: O.S. radio
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Peters reaches towards a small video deck. Touches the eject button. Nothing happens.
C: PETERS
D: It's stuck.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT
N: Justin's light bounces off an even larger pressure door, built like a bank vault. The Second Seal.
C: JUSTIN
D: I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
C: WEIR
D: That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
E: O.S. radio
C: JUSTIN
D: I'm going in.
N: Justin opens the seal. It releases SLOWLY, inching open. Justin squeezes through.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Peters takes a small probe from her belt, inserts it into the video deck. A small laser disc emerges partway from the deck. Peters pulls on it. It doesn't move.
C: PETERS
D: It's really jammed in there.
N: A shadow crosses the window behind her. Someone -- something -- is in there with her... Peters pulls harder. Nothing. Another effort. The disc pulls free. Peters spins in the zero-gravity, spinning into... ...A BODY floating at the helm, the face illuminated by Peters' helmet lights. His swollen tongue clogs his gaping, screaming mouth. His cracked and crystallized skin is crossed by a network of bloated veins. He has no eyes. Just like Weir's dream.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: Peters' monitor shows the CORPSE'S face, its mouth open in mute agony. Weir GASPS.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Peters pushes free of the body.
C: PETERS
D: I found one.
E: professional
C: MILLER
D: Alive?
E: O.S. radio
C: PETERS
D: Frozen.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: The dead man's face leers from Peters' monitor.
C: STARCK
D: What happened to his eyes?
C: SMITH
D: Explosive decompression.
C: STARCK
D: Decompression wouldn't do that.
N: Weir just stares at the ruined face, rapt. Starck notices.
C: STARCK
D: You okay?
N: Weir nods, not taking his eyes from the screen.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY
N: Cooper, on station. He keys his radio.
C: COOPER
D: Hey, Baby Bear, Mama Bear got a corpsicle for ya...
N: No reply.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
N: Miller looks up from the workstation, concerned.
C: COOPER
D: Baby Bear, you copy?
E: O.S. radio
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY
N: Cooper stares out at Justin's safety line slowly counting off past 175 meters.
C: COOPER
D: Justin, do you copy?
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT
N: The Second Seal is open. Justin's safety line snakes into darkness. FOLLOW the safety line into the dark...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: An alcove, opening into a vast chamber. Once pristine, all the surfaces have been coated in a dark gray slick. Globules of fluid hang motionless, sticking to Justin's suit, leeching away his light and swallowing him in darkness.
C: COOPER
D: ...do you copy?
E: O.S. radio
C: JUSTIN
D: Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
E: quiet
C: COOPER
D: Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
E: O.S. radio
C: JUSTIN
D: I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
N: A lighted console blocks Justin's view of the chamber beyond. He drifts over to it, wipes the console clear of coolant, revealing dim lights: the station has power.
C: JUSTIN
D: The reactor's still hot. Coolant level is on reserve, but still in the green.
N: TIGHT ON JUSTIN'S FACE AS THE LIGHTS COME ON
C: JUSTIN
D: I got it...
E: triumph
N: His expressions changes as he looks past the console and sees... something.
C: JUSTIN
D: Holy shit...
E: trailing off in awe
C: COOPER
D: Justin?
C: JUSTIN
D: I think I found something...
N: JUSTIN'S POV - THE CORE A massive sphere, 10 meters in diameter, dominates the center of the second containment. Intricate machinery surrounds the sphere but the globe itself is featureless, smooth; a enigmatic monolith. Black ice encrusts it, giving it the seeming of a living thing.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: They stare at Justin's monitor.
C: SMITH
D: What the hell is that?
C: WEIR
D: That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

C: MILLER
D: Justin, finish your sweep.
E: O.S. radio
C: JUSTIN
D: Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
N: Justin turns to the Core...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

C: STARCK
D: Justin, hold on a sec, you're breaking up...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
C: STARCK
D: Justin...?
E: O.S. radio static obscure her voice

S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
N: Miller's helmet light flickers...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Peter's helmet light winks out...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
C: STARCK
D: Justin, come in...
N: Suddenly, the bio-scan lights up, from green to red as signals race across the display.
C: WEIR
D: What is it?
C: STARCK
D: I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
C: SMITH
D: Something's wrong...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: Justin places the pressure sensor against the Core. Touching it. The Core turns deepest black. A darkness that light cannot penetrate. For a second, Justin's white suit is captured against the hungry void...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT (TANK)
N: THEN THE VOID SUCKS HIM IN AND JUSTIN IS GONE...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY
N: Cooper stares in shock as Justin's safety line as it reels out at an incredible rate -- 250 meters, 300 meters...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT A WAVE
N: surges out of the Core, bending light like a ripple on a pond, pushing coolant and debris before it...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS
N: The gravity wave surges forward, blowing out emergency lights as it comes, flotsam and jetsam swirling in its wake...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

S: INT. BLACKNESS OF CORE
N: FOLLOWED BY A FACE -- JUSTIN...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
C: MILLER
D: What the hell...
N: A DEEP ROAR fills the ship. Miller rises to investigate... The door BLOWS APART as THE WAVE HITS, ripples through the Medical Bay towards Miller...
C: MILLER
D: Oh shit...!
N: Debris swirls around him... the wave sweeps him up... SLAMS him into a bulkhead...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE JUSTIN'S POV SCREEN
N: the briefest suggestion of a SCREAMING FACE, obscured by STATIC and ROLL before the screen CUTS to static entirely. The rest of the crew's POV screens go dead as... ...the wave hits them, threatening to tear the Lewis and Clark apart. The ship shudders violently. Consoles EXPLODE with sparks. Weir and the others hold on for dear life.
C: STARCK
D: Miller, do you read me, Peters --
C: SMITH
D: Get them back --
C: STARCK
D: I'm trying, goddammit --
N: An equipment rack IGNITES. Smith grabs an extinguisher, fights the blaze...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY
N: Cooper and DJ, bracing against the bulkhead. Cooper hits the intercom.
C: COOPER
D: What's happening?
C: STARCK
D: I don't know, the screens are dead...!
E: O.S. intercom
N: Cooper peers out the airlock window. JUSTIN'S SAFETY LINE passes 350 meters and accelerating...
C: COOPER
D: 350 meters... 400 meters...
C: DJ
D: He's in trouble. Go!
C: COOPER
D: I'm gone!
N: Cooper grabs his helmet. DJ helps him lock the helmet into place with a HISS. The inner airlock door opens. As Cooper enters the airlock, Justin's safety reel stops, the line jerking taut at 500 meters.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
N: Miller tries to get his bearings in the dark.
C: MILLER
D: Boarding party, sound off... Peters, do you read me... . Peters...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Peters' light, too, remains dark, but Neptune's blue light fills the Bridge. The frozen corpse floats before her. No longer a man. A young boy, maybe five years old. His legs are withered, useless things. The skin remains a crystallized surface, but the eyes look straight at her, alive.
C: PETERS
D: Denny...
N: Peters reaches out to touch the body. It falls away from her. No longer her son, but the body of the astronaut. It hits the door and shatters.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

N: Cooper enters at full speed, shooting through in a controlled fall...
C: COOPER
D: Hold on, Baby Bear...

N: ...into the Second Containment. He catches himself at the console. Cooper sees Justin's safety line, cut off abruptly by the darkness of the Core.
C: COOPER
D: Oh my God...
N: The darkness of the Core ripples... Justin suddenly emerges from the darkness, a white figure riding a wave of impenetrable blackness. Cooper catches him, holds him tight as the wave carries them towards the wall. Cooper sees a control rod -- a long metal spike -- coming at them. He twists his body so that they miss -- barely -- before slamming into the wall.
C: COOPER
D: Justin, do you read me? Justin... .
N: Cooper pulls Justin close. Justin's head lolls to one side. Unconscious.

D: Baby Bear, don't do this. Don't do this...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: Weir, Starck and Smith continue to hold on tightly as the vibration builds... and builds...
C: STARCK
D: Here comes another one! Hold on!
N: The second wave hits. Sparks fly as consoles EXPLODE. Deep in the ship metal SCREAMS, followed by the SHRIEK of escaping atmosphere. An emergency klaxon RINGS out: PRESSURE WARNING. Starck checks Justin's station:

N: Starck and Smith already in suits. DJ assists Weir. Smith has already locked his helmet into place.
C: SMITH
D: We lost the starboard baffle and the hull cracked. Our safety seals didn't close, the circuit's fried --
E: continuing
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
N: Miller moves down the central corridor towards his wounded ship.
C: MILLER
D: Do we have enough time for a weld?
C: SMITH
D: We don't have time to fart.
E: O.S. radio
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY
C: SMITH
D: We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
C: MILLER
D: No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
C: SMITH
D: They're gone.
E: O.S. radio
N: Beat. Miller closes his eyes, desperately trying to think of a solution.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY
N: PAN across the faces of the astronauts. No hope. Except for Weir:
C: WEIR
D: The Event Horizon.
N: The others turn to stare at Weir.
C: SMITH
D: What?
C: WEIR
D: It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
C: STARCK
D: What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
C: SMITH
D: I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
C: WEIR
D: It beats dying, Mister Smith.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
C: MILLER
D: Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
C: SMITH
D: But...
E: O.S. radio
C: MILLER
D: You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Peters at the life support console.
C: PETERS
D: I'm ahead of you. Bringing the thermal units on line...
N: Peters flips a series of circuit-breakers. Reaches for the final switch.
C: PETERS
D: Hold tight and prep for gees.
N: Everything floating in the bridge CRASHES to the floor.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: Justin and Cooper collapse to the deck, coolant splashing down all around them...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS
N: Miller meets the crew as they evacuate the Lewis and Clark. Weir leads the way, eager; Smith hangs back.
C: MILLER
D: Everybody okay?
C: STARCK
D: We're all here.
C: MILLER
D: Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
N: Miller reaches for the catch on his own helmet.
C: DJ
D: We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
C: MILLER
D: No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
N: Miller pulls his helmet off with a HISS. He breathes deep. Starck does the same, coughs.
C: STARCK
D: It tastes bad.
C: MILLER
D: But you can breathe it.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. NEPTUNE ORBIT - LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON
N: The Lewis and Clark and the Event Horizon, locked together in Neptune orbit. Lights shine from the Horizon as power is restored. No longer cloaked in darkness, it is revealed in all its hideous glory, a nightmare etched in steel.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Weir moves from station to station, restoring power to each. Starck sits at the communications workstation. Miller watches over her shoulder.
C: STARCK
D: The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
C: MILLER
D: How much oh-two do we have?
C: STARCK
D: Oxygen is not the problem.
C: MILLER
D: Carbon dioxide?
C: STARCK
D: It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
E: nods
C: MILLER
D: We can take the filters from the Clark...
C: STARCK
D: I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
C: MILLER
D: What about the life readings you picked up?
C: STARCK
D: The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
C: MILLER
D: What's causing the readings?
C: STARCK
D: I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
C: MILLER
D: So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
N: Weir just stares at the bloodstained wall.
C: MILLER
D: What happened here?
N: Miller follows Weir's gaze to the wall: a Rorschach test in blood...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE WINDOW
N: PULL BACK from the bridge windows TO REVEAL...
S: EXT. EVENT HORIZON - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL
N: ...the Event Horizon in all its horrific glory, hanging skew in the center of the hurricane like a mote in God's eye. The Lewis and Clark clings to the giant craft, as insignificant as a tick. An even smaller figure clings to the hull of the Lewis and Clark...
S: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION
N: It's Smith, EVA in full protective gear. His magnetic boots hold him to the Lewis and Clark's hull. He kneels over a hole in the hull, where the metal has buckled and torn. Vapor still leaks from the hole into space.
C: SMITH
D: Captain Miller, you copy?
C: MILLER
D: I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
E: O.S. radio
C: SMITH
D: I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
C: MILLER
D: We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
E: O.S. radio
C: SMITH
D: Understood.
N: Smith uses a foam applicator to fill the hole. The gel freezes in place. Smith reaches to his belt, pulls out a ZERO-G NAILGUN. Presses it to the patch and begins to rivet it into place.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
N: Justin lies unmoving on a table. His eyes are open, staring at a smear of blood on the ceiling. A needle slides into the skin below his eye. He doesn't respond. DJ removes the needle. It glistens with blood. He looks up at Miller and Peters.
C: MILLER
D: How is he?
C: DJ
D: His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
C: PETERS
D: What happened to him?
N: DJ shakes his head. Miller eyes the bloodstain above them.
C: MILLER
D: DJ, take samples from these stains, compare them to medical records, I want to know whose blood this is.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Gravity has scattered debris and freeze-dried blood about the room. The crew (Justin and Smith excepted) tries to relax on the chairs of dead men. Their faces are wan and haggard. Weir relaxes at the table. Unlike the others, he seems almost at ease. DJ remains forever stoic; Starck, animated and nervous. Cooper bounces the handball on the floor, a reflex action. Miller stares at a video monitor, watching Smith repair the Lewis and Clark. He turns from the window.
C: MILLER
D: Okay, people, there's been a change in the mission. In less than eighteen hours, we will run out of breathable air. Our primary objective is now survival. That means we focus on repairing the Lewis and Clark and salvaging whatever will buy us more time. Our secondary objective is finding out what happened to this ship and its crew. Two months from now, I fully intend to be standing in front of the good Admiral giving my report, and I'd like to have more than my dick in my hands.
E: pause
N: Grim smiles all around.
C: MILLER
D: Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
C: PETERS
D: I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
C: MILLER
D: Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
C: STARCK
D: What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
C: MILLER
D: Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
C: STARCK
D: I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
C: MILLER
D: Do it. Dr. Weir...
C: WEIR
D: Yes.
C: MILLER
D: One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
C: COOPER
D: I told you. He was inside the Core...
N: Weir starts shaking his head.
C: COOPER
D: It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
C: WEIR
D: No, he didn't.
E: cutting him off
C: COOPER
D: You weren't there. I saw it.
C: WEIR
D: Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
N: Cooper throws the ball at him, hard. Weir ducks. It bounces wildly around the room. Miller catches it.
C: MILLER
D: Cooper! Enough!
N: Cooper sits down.
C: MILLER
D: Dr. Weir, Justin may die. Whatever happened to him could happen to all of us.
E: turning on Weir
N: Beat.
C: WEIR
D: I don't know what happened to Justin.
C: COOPER
D: I'm telling you, I saw it...
C: WEIR
D: What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
C: COOPER
D: I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
E: turning on Weir
C: MILLER
D: Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
C: WEIR
D: It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
C: MILLER
D: What could cause them? What's in the Core?
E: Weir doesn't answer
C: WEIR
D: It's complicated...
C: MILLER
D: How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
N: Beat. Here comes another bomb...
C: WEIR
D: A black hole.
N: The crew stares at him, stunned.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: Miller, Starck and Weir stand before the Core. Dark ominous structures loom around them, glistening with coolant. The PULSE of the ship is loud here, a deep THRUM that steals their breath. Weir's voice is a reverent WHISPER:
C: WEIR
D: That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
C: STARCK
D: I can't believe we built this.
C: MILLER
D: It's insane.
C: WEIR
D: "Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
C: MILLER
D: If it worked.
C: WEIR
D: If it worked, yes.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT - 3RD SEAL
N: They stare at the Core, the surrounding machinery moving in a slow giant's dance. A trick of the eye, or does the Core stare back at them?
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
C: MILLER
D: I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
C: WEIR
D: There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
C: MILLER
D: Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men. No one goes near that thing.
E: beat
N: MOVE IN ON THE CORE until its darkness fills the screen...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
N: Peters sits before the computer workstation, running the ship's log, forwarding through hours of boring footage. Rubs her eyes. The lights flicker. Peters hears something RUSTLING behind her. She turns...
C: PETERS
D: Justin...?
N: Justin lies unmoving on the nearest examination table. Comatose. Peters reaches out and picks up a scalpel. Peters hears the sound again, FINGERNAILS ON PLASTIC. She moves past Justin... ...past several empty tables, covered with clear plastic... ...to the last table. She stares in shock. THERE'S SOMETHING UNDERNEATH THE PLASTIC COVER She slowly reaches out. Lifts the cover. Her son DENNY looks at her and GIGGLES. She GASPS. The scalpel drops to the floor at her feet. Denny reaches up to her, to be picked up...
C: DENNY
D: Mommy...
N: ...but the plastic that still covers his withered legs squirms like a bag full of snakes... Peters drops the plastic and backs away.
C: DJ
D: Peters?
E: O.S.
N: She turns. DJ stands in the doorway, holding blood samples. Peters turns back, but her son is gone. DJ reads her expression.

N: The Airlock light turns red -- a warning. The Inner Airlock door control flashes: "LOCKED." The Outer Airlock door opens. Smith enters. He closes the Outer Airlock door. Atmosphere HISSES into the chamber. The Inner Airlock door flashes: "PRESSURIZED."
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 2
N: Cooper in EVA, getting ready to go outside. The Inner Airlock door opens. Smith enters. Takes off his helmet.
C: COOPER
D: You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
C: SMITH
D: I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
C: COOPER
D: What?
C: SMITH
D: You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
C: COOPER
D: Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
C: SMITH
D: You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
C: COOPER
D: You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.

N: Starck programs the sensor workstation. She glances over at Weir: sitting at a computer terminal, his face rapt as data flashes by. His lips move, muttering to himself.
C: STARCK
D: Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
C: WEIR
D: Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
C: STARCK
D: Claire is your wife?
C: WEIR
D: Yes.
C: STARCK
D: It must be hard, being so far away from her.
C: WEIR
D: Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
C: STARCK
D: I'm sorry.
N: Weir keeps his attention focused on the screen.
C: WEIR
D: These things happen. Wait a minute, that's not right...
E: reacting to something on the screen
N: He fingers fly across the keyboard, double-checking the data. Miller leans over Weir's shoulder.
C: MILLER
D: You have something, Dr. Weir?
C: WEIR
D: The date.
C: MILLER
D: What about it?
C: WEIR
D: The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
C: MILLER
D: It's 2041...
C: WEIR
D: Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
C: STARCK
D: Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
C: WEIR
D: No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
C: MILLER
D: Explanation?
C: WEIR
D: Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible... Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened... The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
E: beat he shakes his head

S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
N: A BURST of static... ...followed by an inhuman HOWL of FEEDBACK, like screaming hyaenas, almost alive. Through the swirl of static, the suggestion of movement. Miller freezes the frame. He squints at the screen... POV MILLER Obscured by static, the image is blurred beyond comprehension.
C: MILLER
D: What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
C: WEIR
D: I don't know.
C: PETERS
D: I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
C: MILLER
D: Do it.
N: Suddenly, the lights fade out. Dim emergency lighting snaps on...
C: PETERS
D: What's happening...?
C: DJ
D: A power drain --
C: MILLER
D: We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
C: WEIR
D: The Core...!
N: Weir heads for the door.
C: MILLER
D: Wait!

C: MILLER
D: No radiation. What's causing the drain?
N: Weir crosses to a console. Frowns.
C: WEIR
D: The magnetic fields are holding. Maybe a short in the fail-safe circuit. I'll check it out.
E: shakes his head
N: Miller assists Weir in removing bolts from an access panel. The panel falls away, revealing a cramped duct leading into the ship's circuitry. Weir climbs into the duct. Miller hands him a flashlight and a toolkit.
C: MILLER
D: We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
C: WEIR
D: Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
N: Weir begins to crawl into the depths of the ship.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT
N: Weir's breath ECHOES in the cramped shaft. He counts off circuit panels as he goes:
C: WEIR
D: E-three... E-five... E-seven... where are you...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: Miller slogs through the coolant to the Core. Stares at it. It remains metallic, mundane. He pulls out a Geiger counter and crosses to the reactor shell. Examines a gleaming weld. The Geiger counter CLICKS slowly: no leak.

S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT
N: Weir stops before module E-12. Hears a faint HISSING and POPPING.
C: WEIR
D: There you are.
N: He uses a screwdriver to open up the module. Reveals a series of circuit boards. One SPARKS. Weir plucks the damaged chips and starts running a by-pass. His flashlight flickers. He bangs it against the duct wall. It grows dimmer. Goes out.
C: WEIR
D: Um. Captain Miller? I, uh, I seem to have a problem with my light.
N: A single DRIP of water in the darkness...
C: WEIR
D: Captain Miller?
E: beat, hushed
N: Another DRIP, then a woman's VOICE like a distant echo:
C: VOICE
D: Billy.

C: CLAIRE
D: Billy. Help me. I'm so cold.
E: O.S.
N: Weir's eyes open wide in hope and fear.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: Even the emergency lights go out. Total darkness.
C: MILLER
D: We just lost all power in here. Dr. Weir...?
N: Miller's voice trails off as he looks towards the Core. A red glow reflects across his eyes. He takes a few steps away from the reactor. He stares... ...at the BURNING MAN, standing before the Core. The deep ROAR of its conflagration fills the containment. It slowly turns and raises its arm and points at Miller in accusation.
C: BURNING MAN
D: Don't leave me...
N: Miller stares as the Burning Man turns and vanishes into a bulkhead, leaving the wall blackened and burned with his passing.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT

C: PETERS
D: I've seen bodies before. This is different.
N: She falls silent, unwilling to say more.
C: MILLER
D: Peters is right. Its like something reaching into your mind. Seeing your thoughts and making them real. Smith, did you or Cooper experience anything unusual?
N: Smith, leaning against the doorway:
C: SMITH
D: I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.

D: ...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
C: MILLER
D: That's enough!
N: DJ lays one hand on Smith's shoulder to calm him... Smith reacts violently, turning on DJ, shoving him back. DJ uses Smith's momentum to spin the pilot into the wall. He presses his scalpel just below Smith's ear...
C: MILLER

N: Miller heads him off, grabs him.
C: MILLER
D: That's it, that's enough for one day, Smith! I need you back on the Clark, I need you calm, I need you using your head, you make a mistake out there, none of are getting home, you understand?
N: Smith calms.
C: SMITH
D: Sir.
C: MILLER
D: Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
N: Smith leaves.
C: MILLER
D: We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
C: WEIR
D: I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
C: MILLER
D: Do it.
C: DJ
D: To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.

E: simultaneous
C: STARCK
D: I've got a theory.
N: Miller stops.
C: MILLER
D: Go ahead.
C: STARCK
D: There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...

C: STARCK
D: I know that.
N: Beat. Miller allows himself to relax.
C: MILLER
D: If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?

E: checks her watch
C: MILLER
D: I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.

S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
N: Peters has fallen asleep in her chair. On the threshold of hearing, a distant POUNDING. Not a heartbeat. Metal on metal. Something trying to get out. Something trying to get in. Peters wakes with a start.
C: PETERS
D: Justin...?
N: She turns. Justin lies on the floor in a heap, completely covered by his sheet. She crosses to him. Pulls back the sheet... Revealing empty nitrogen tanks.
C: PETERS
D: Justin!
N: She looks up, eyes widening, as... The IV bottles fill with blood. Blood fills the X-ray lightboxes, it surges up from gutters in the floor... And the pounding grows louder... LOUDER... almost to Medical... The spell breaks and she RUNS...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR
N: Peters sprints, the SOUND BOOMING after her, almost on her heels...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER
N: Peters darts into the Bridge Antechamber. She SLAMS the pressure door shut behind her, CUTTING OFF the sound. She turns. Weir, DJ, Starck look up from their work, staring at her.
C: DJ
D: What's wrong?
C: PETERS
D: You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
C: STARCK
D: Heard what?
N: Beat. Peters starts to LAUGH, part hysteria, part relief.
C: PETERS
D: Oh... nothing...
N: DJ crosses to Peters, concerned.
C: DJ
D: Sit down...
N: As he reaches out to touch her... BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. POUNDING ON THE DOOR ITSELF Peters SCREAMS. DJ clutches her to him, backs away from the door. The POUNDING grows louder. LOUDER. The door vibrates with each blow Starck puts her hands over her ears. Peters SCREAMS at the door.
C: PETERS
D: Stop it! Stop it!
N: But the POUNDING intensifies, metal GROANING under incredible pressure.
C: DJ
D: What is it?
E: shouting to be heard
N: Weir slowly walks to the door.
C: STARCK
D: What are you doing?
C: WEIR
D: It wants me. I have to go.
N: He reaches for the door.
C: STARCK
D: No...!
N: Starck grabs him. He tries to shake her off, but she traps his arm in a wrist-lock. He turns on her, his face furious... ...and the POUNDING stops. They remain frozen for a moment. Afraid to breathe. Weir shakes the trance.
C: STARCK
D: In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
C: WEIR
D: I'm alright. Please.
N: In the distance, the POUNDING begins again. Moving away from them. The ship systems station BEEPS. A warning light flashes on the console.
C: STARCK
D: What is it?
C: WEIR
D: The forward airlock.

N: They race into the bay even as Justin steps into the Airlock. He is naked.
C: PETERS
D: Justin, no!
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

E: to Cooper
C: COOPER
D: But Justin...
C: MILLER
D: I'll get him.
N: Miller swings his body around, heads across the umbilicus to the Event Horizon. He moves in great leaps, using the magnetic plates in his gloves and boots to keep from drifting off into Neptune's thin atmosphere.
T: CUT TO:

D: Can you shut it down?
N: She opens the Airlock access panel.
C: STARCK
D: I'll try. DJ, you better get your bag of tricks.
N: DJ nods, runs off. Peters bangs on the Airlock door.

D: Justin! Open the door!

S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3
N: Peters, against the window:
C: PETERS
D: The door, Justin! Open the door!
E: muffled
N: He fixes his gaze upon the outer airlock door. And beyond it, space. He speaks in a flat monotone:
C: JUSTIN
D: Did you hear it?
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3
N: They are stunned to hear his voice. Peters answers:
C: PETERS
D: Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
C: STARCK
D: Keep him talking.

D: Do you know what it was?
C: JUSTIN
D: It gets inside you. It shows you things... horrible things...

N: A LOW MOAN escapes Weir's lips. He cradles his head in his hands.
S: EXT. EVENT HORIZON - (MILLER'S CROSSING)
N: Miller races across the surface of the Event Horizon, the only sounds, his LABOURED BREATHING, and Justin's tortured VOICE, patched through on his radio:
C: JUSTIN
D: ...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
E: O.S. radio

S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3
N: Peters presses her face against the Airlock window, trying to calm him:
C: PETERS
D: Justin, look at me. Look at me. Open this door.
N: DJ runs up with his medkit.
C: STARCK
D: I don't think she can talk him down. We need a sedative.
C: DJ
D: If he opens the outer door he'll turn inside-out.
N: Starck's hands fly as she re-wires the circuits. Sweat beads her face.
C: STARCK
D: Almost got it.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3
C: PETERS
D: Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
E: O.S. muffled
N: Justin looks at her with dead eyes. He reaches out to gently touch the glass between them.
C: JUSTIN
D: If you could see the things I've seen, you wouldn't try to stop me. You'd come with me.
N: Justin's hand moves to the OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR control. Hesitates... then floats to the OUTER AIRLOCK control. Hits it.
C: PETERS
D: NOOO!
E: muffled
N: A yellow warning light flashes. A warning klaxon WHOOPS, deafening. Justin jerks his hands to his ears, closes his eyes...
C: COMPUTER
D: Stand-by for decompression. Thirty seconds...
N: Justin opens his eyes as if waking from a dream...
C: JUSTIN
D: Hey, Mama-Bear... what are doing...?
N: And then he realizes where he is...and what is about to happen.
C: JUSTIN
D: Oh my god OH MY GOD...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3
C: PETERS
D: Starck!
C: STARCK
D: I can't! The inner door can't open once the outer door has been triggered, it would decompress the entire ship!

E: O.S. radio
S: EXT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3
N: Miller moves faster and faster, his BREATH echoing in his helmet. He can see the exterior airlock just beyond a deep chasm in the ship's superstructure. If he misses this jump, Justin will not be the only man to die today. He doesn't hesitate but leaps, soaring across the chasm towards the airlock.
C: JUSTIN
D: ...I don't want to die...!
E: radio
C: MILLER
D: You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

D: But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
C: MILLER
D: Justin. I won't let you die.

N: Miller's words give Justin hope. He regains some control.

D: Okay... okay...
N: Justin breathes hard and follows Miller's hurried instructions:

D: Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
E: radio

D: Five seconds.
S: EXT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

S: INT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3
N: Justin goes into a fetal crouch and covers his eyes.
C: JUSTIN
D: Oh god --
N: He wheezes out all his air...
S: EXT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3
N: Miller squats on the girder, ready to push off. He focuses on the 5 meters of space between him and the airlock... The outer doors OPEN... The rush of escaping atmosphere carries Justin's body out... Miller pushes off... catches Justin's body... sending them both back towards the open Airlock... Ice forms on Justin's body. His veins bulge. Blood fountains from his noise and mouth, forming a red icicle over his face. Miller pulls him into the Airlock. Five seconds have passed since the airlock door opened.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3
N: Miller closes the Airlock behind them. Air HISSES into the chamber. Justin's body hits the deck as "normal" gravity exerts itself. Miller opens the Inner Door. Peters and DJ rush in.
C: PETERS
D: Oh God... Justin...
N: DJ puts a tube in the Justin's mouth immediately, feeding him oxygen.
C: PETERS
D: I've got a pulse, he's alive...
C: DJ
D: Pressure?
C: PETERS
D: 90 over 50 and falling... .
C: DJ
D: He's crashing...
N: Blood bubbles from Justin's mouth and eyes. He GASPS, then SCREAMS, spraying blood from his mouth.
C: DJ
D: He can breathe. That's good. Let's get him to Medical, go, go!
N: Starck helps DJ and Peters carry Justin from the Airlock. Miller sits there, exhausted. Reaches up and pulls his helmet off.

S: INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY
N: One of the tanks has been activated. Swaddled in bandages, Justin floats within, suspended in green gel. The others -- DJ, Starck, Peters, Miller, Weir -- look exhausted.
C: DJ
D: He'll live... if we ever make it back.
C: MILLER
D: We'll make it.
C: STARCK
D: CO2 levels will reach toxic levels in four hours.
N: Peters stands, looking at Justin's ravaged form floating in the tank.
C: MILLER
D: Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
E: gently
C: PETERS
D: I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
E: weakly
C: MILLER
D: Thanks.
N: Peters exits.
C: STARCK
D: Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
C: WEIR
D: It means nothing.
C: MILLER
D: Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
C: WEIR
D: Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
C: DJ
D: How would you explain your own behavior?
C: WEIR
D: What?
C: STARCK
D: On the bridge. You said "it" wanted you.
N: Weir glances at Justin...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY -- POV OF CLAIRE
N: But it's not Justin in the tank. It's his wife CLAIRE, naked, wet, dead. Weir stares at her.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY
C: WEIR
D: I said that?
C: DJ
D: Yes. You did.
N: Weir blinks. Justin floats in the grav couch. Weir turns back to the others.
C: WEIR
D: I don't remember saying that. Maybe I'm insane, too.
E: covers with a joke
N: Weir exits.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GENERIC CORRIDOR
N: Miller follows Weir out of the Gravity Couch Bay.
C: MILLER
D: I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
C: WEIR
D: Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
C: MILLER
D: That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
E: exploding
C: WEIR
D: What do you want me to say?
C: MILLER
D: You said this ship creates a gateway...
C: WEIR
D: Yes...
C: MILLER
D: To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
C: WEIR
D: I don't know...
C: MILLER
D: Where has it been for the past seven years?
C: WEIR
D: I don't know...

D: The "Other Place," what is that...?

D: That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
T: CUT TO:

N: Miller moves through the maze of the ship, heading for the Bridge. As he reaches a junction, he hears... ...A DISTANT CRY...
C: VOICE
D: Don't leave me...!
E: O.S.
N: Miller wheels like a cat, staring wildly down the branching corridors. Nothing. He is alone. Miller leans against the wall, sinks to the floor, rests his head in his hands.
S: EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL
N: The grotesque ship continues it's orbit as the moon Triton eclipses the sun. Darkness swallows all.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY
N: DJ enters, checks Justin's display.
C: MILLER
D: Any change?
E: O.S.
N: DJ turns, surprised. Miller sits, barely visible in the dark.
C: DJ
D: No. No change. I've analyzed Justin's blood samples. There's no evidence of excessive levels of carbon dioxide. Or anything else out of ordinary.
E: beat
N: A grim LAUGH from Miller.
C: MILLER
D: Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things. I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
E: beat
C: DJ
D: "Another man?" Who?
N: Miller nods, pulls his service medal from beneath his jumpsuit.
C: MILLER
D: It was on the Goliath. There was this bosun, Corrick, a young guy, a lot like Justin. Edmund Corrick, from Decatur, Georgia. He got caught when the pressure doors sealed, one closed on his arm. Severed it at the wrist. The pain of that must have been... He passed out and...
N: Miller trails off. DJ waits patiently. Finally:
C: MILLER
D: I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone. I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of. And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
E: beat beat, wan smile
C: DJ
D: No.
N: Miller sees something in DJ's expression.
C: MILLER
D: What is it?
C: DJ
D: I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
C: MILLER
D: Go on.
N: DJ plays the recording again. Stops it abruptly.
C: DJ
D: They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
C: MILLER
D: It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
C: DJ
D: It gets worse.
N: Miller stares at him.
C: DJ
D: It's very hard to make out, but listen to this final part.
N: He plays the recording again.
C: DJ
D: Do you hear it? Right there.
C: MILLER
D: Hear what?
C: DJ
D: It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
C: MILLER
D: "Save yourself. From Hell." What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
E: beat
C: DJ
D: No. I don't believe in that sort of thing. But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen... And what it's brought back with it.

N: still distorted by static and roll, but finally lucid: FOUR ORIGINAL CREW of the Event Horizon. On the Bridge. ONE MAN dislocates his shoulder with a WET POPPING sound as he shoves his arm down his own throat. Blood bubbles from his nose. With a SHUCKING sound, he pulls his stomach out his mouth... Behind him, a MAN and WOMAN fuck, covered with blood. She bites through his neck. His head lolls to the other side. She buries her face in the torn flesh as he thrusts into her again and again... Presiding over them, KILPACK. His eyes are bloody holes. His hands reach out in offering. In the palms of his hands, his eyes. Kilpack opens his mouth and speaks with an INHUMAN VOICE.
C: KILPACK
D: Liberatis tutemet ex infera...

C: MILLER
D: We're leaving.
C: WEIR
D: You can't, your orders are specific...
C: MILLER
D: "...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
C: WEIR
D: You're insane. You've lost your mind.
C: MILLER
D: Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And
C: I think there is.
D: Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.

D: You... You can't do that!

D: Watch me.
N: Miller turns to walk away. Weir grabs Miller, wheeling him around, almost frenzied.
C: WEIR
D: You can't kill her, I won't let you! I lost her once, I will not lose her again...!
N: Miller shoves Weir back into the wall. The two stare at each other. Adversaries... The lights cut to emergency lighting.

C: WEIR
D: You can't leave. She won't let you.
C: MILLER
D: Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.

D: Denny...?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: Miller sits at Justin's engineering position. Flips a series of switches...
S: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL
N: Cooper works on the patch as the ship's running lights come on in sequence...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
N: The bridge lights flicker, illuminate...
C: MILLER
D: Thank you.
E: to his ship
C: SMITH
D: Captain, we got a problem.
E: O.S. radio
C: MILLER
D: Now what?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS
N: SMITH AND MILLER
C: SMITH
D: She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
C: MILLER
D: Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - DENNY'S DUCT
N: Peters moves through the duct. Reaches a junction. Anything could be with her, there in the dark. A child's WHISPER, too faint for words. Peters turns... Behind her, FOREGROUND, a YOUNG CHILD dashes across the corridor. Peters turns back. Too late to see. Again, the child's WHISPER draws her onward.
C: PETERS
D: Denny? Denny, come to Mommy...
N: FAINT LAUGHTER is her only answer. She follows the sound, now climbing into a vertical shaft that takes her higher and higher...
C: PETERS
D: Hold on, Denny, Mommy's coming...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - DENNY'S DUCT - CATWALK
N: Peters pulls herself up from the vertical shaft onto a catwalk that snakes between huge oily machinery, just in time to see... A SMALL CHILD running, disappearing into the gloom ahead.
C: PETERS
D: Denny?
N: She runs forward into a junction. The lights flicker red.
C: PETERS
D: Denny...?
C: DENNY
D: Mommy...
N: Her son can barely be seen in the flickering darkness ahead.
C: PETERS
D: You can walk... Denny, you can walk... oh, my baby...
C: DENNY
D: Wanna show you, Mommy, wanna show you something...
N: He reaches his arms out to her... Peters steps forward, reaching for her son... ...falling into an open access hatch, hidden in the dark...
S: INT. DENNY'S DUCT - (VERTICAL TUBE)
N: ...a twenty meter drop...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: Peters hits hard, lies before the Core, an offering of flesh and blood. Her legs twist beneath her, shattered; blood pools around her head. Her chest heaves: still alive.
C: PETERS
D: Denny...
E: bloody gasp
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - DENNY'S DUCT - TUBE SECTION
N: Denny peers down from the top of the shaft and GIGGLES. CLAPS his hands in childlike glee.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT
N: Weir wanders into First Containment, brooding.
C: WEIR
D: I won't. I won't leave. This is my ship.
E: to himself
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: Weir enters the Second Containment. Freezes as he sees... Peters body lying twisted and broken before the Core.
C: WEIR
D: Oh no. Peters...?
N: He rushes to Peters. Reaches out to touch her but pulls his hand back. Her eyes are black, eight-ball hemorrhage darkening the irises. She is dead.
C: WEIR
D: Why did you do that? You didn't have to do that...
C: CLAIRE
D: Billy.
E: O.S.
N: Weir looks up from Peters' corpse. CLAIRE stands before the Core. She is naked. Her skin is pale and beautiful and cold and wet. Her hair hangs in her face, covering her milk-white eyes...
S: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT
N: Claire stands naked before the bathroom mirror. Behind her, the tub steams...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT - (SEX AND SUICIDE
T: INTERCUT)
N: Weir stares at Claire in shock. She walks to him. Slowly. She stops in front of him. Her arms hang at her sides. He must reach for her. He does, putting his hands on her hips. He slides from his chair to the floor to his knees. He presses his face to her pale belly and cries. SOBS wrack his body...
S: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT
N: ...and in the bathroom, she clutches Weir's straight-razor...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: She reaches down. Slowly, her arms cradle his head. She slides down on him. Straddles him.
S: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT
N: ...Claire slips into the steaming water...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: He raises his head to her breasts. His eyes, closed. She remains unnaturally still, only her hips rocking back and forth. Weir's mouth opens, GASPS as he enters her...
S: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT
N: ...and the razor bites her skin...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: She caresses his face. Lifts his face to hers. Her mouth is slack. Her hair hangs in front of her eyes.
S: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT
N: ...Claire floats dead in the red water, eyes open, hair billowing around her head like a halo...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: Weir gazes up at her, transfixed. He takes her hand and raises it to his face. She caresses his cheek. And reaches for his eyes...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT
N: A MUFFLED SCREAM rips through the Second Containment Seal. It begins as a human sound and ends as something else, an alien CRY of rage.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS
N: The CRY echoes down the Main Corridor.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
N: DJ packs up blood samples. He raises his head at the sound of the CRY.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Starck GASPS as the CRY resounds through the bridge.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS
N: Miller turns in the direction of the CRY. He begins to move down the Corridor, towards the source.
S: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION
N: Cooper examines the weld on the baffle plate. It's solid.
C: COOPER
D: Solid as a rock. Hey, Smith...
E: into his radio
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK
C: COOPER
D: Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
E: O.S. intercom
C: SMITH
D: Roger that.
N: Smith carries another load of supplies. Movement out of the corner of his eye... He turns in time to see Weir disappear around a corner inside the Event Horizon.
C: SMITH
D: Dr. Weir! Hey, get your ass back on board! Dr. Weir!
N: No response. Smith keys the radio.
C: SMITH
D: Skipper, come in...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS
N: Miller jogs down the Main Corridor. An INTERCOM gets his attention:
C: SMITH
D: Skipper...
E: O.S. intercom
C: MILLER
D: What is it, Smith?
E: into intercom
C: SMITH
D: I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
E: O.S. intercom
N: Something SPARKS and SIZZLES in the dim light, catching Miller's eye. He looks up... One of the EXPLOSIVE CHARGES has been removed from the its mounting in the Corridor.
C: MILLER
D: Smith, get out of there...
C: SMITH
D: Come again, Skipper?
E: O.S. intercom
C: MILLER
D: One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK
N: Smith's eyes open wide.
C: MILLER
D: Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
E: O.S. intercom
C: SMITH
D: No, no, we just got her back together...
C: MILLER
D: Get out of there now!
E: O.S. intercom
N: But Smith has already left the airlock...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS
N: ...entering the Quarters, tearing through storage lockers.
C: SMITH
D: Where is it, where is it...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS
C: MILLER
D: Smith? Smith! Fuck!
N: Miller races down the corridor towards the airlock, towards his ship...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS
N: A BEEPING sound catches Smith's attention. He follows the sound to a storage compartment. Rifles through it.
C: SMITH
D: I gotcha... I gotcha...
N: The BEEPS are coming closer and closer together. Smith grabs a duffel.
C: SMITH
D: I gotcha.
N: Opens it. He sees the EXPLOSIVE CHARGE from the Event Horizon even as the BEEPS become a steady TONE. He closes his eyes and SIGHS...
S: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLOSION
N: WHITE LIGHT. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED
N: UMBILICUS) Miller enters the docking bay even as a HUGE BLAST knocks him back.
C: MILLER
D: NOOO!
N: Safety doors close, sealing off the airlock and preventing loss of pressure.
S: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL
N: The SILENT EXPLOSION tears the Lewis and Clark into two pieces, spiralling away from each other and from the Event Horizon. Metal shards, like confetti, fill the space between them.
S: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLODED HULL SECTION
N: Cooper clings to the forward section, watching the Event Horizon recede as he tumbles into space. His FRENZIED BREATHING is the only sound.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED
N: UMBILICUS) Miller gets to his feet. Stares out the window upon the wreckage of his ship, spiralling away. He hits the intercom with his forearm.
C: MILLER
D: DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
C: DJ
D: What happened?
C: MILLER
D: Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
E: O.S. intercom
N: The door opens behind DJ. The lights go out. DJ turns... Face to face with Weir... Blood crusts Weir's cheekbones, his mouth. He has no eyes. Only clotted, empty sockets. DJ opens his mouth to SCREAM. Weir grabs DJ by the throat,
T: cutting him off.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED
N: UMBILICUS)
C: MILLER
D: DJ, you read me?
N: DJ does not answer. The CRASH of glass and steel resonates over the intercom.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
N: Too dark to see... glimpses of violent motion in the stainless steel cabinets... the sounds of STRUGGLE continue... ...then something WET... and the struggle stops.
C: MILLER
D: DJ? DJ, come in...
E: O.S. intercom
N: Finally, Weir emerges from the gloom. He searches among the surgical instruments until his blood caked hands find a needle... and thread...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED
N: UMBILICUS) Miller, at the intercom. He tries another channel.
C: MILLER
D: Peters...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: Peters body lies before the Core. The intercom CRACKLES.
C: MILLER
D: Peters, are you there?
E: O.S. intercom
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 1 - (TATTERED UMBILICUS)
C: MILLER
D: Starck, do you read me? Starck...?
E: growing panic
N: But it is Weir who answers. His voice sounds thick, choked with dirt.
C: WEIR
D: I told you... She won't let you leave...
E: O.S. intercom
C: MILLER
D: Son of a bitch!
N: Miller yanks open a storage locker full of zero-G tool. Lifts a nailgun. Chambers a round.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLODED HULL SECTION
N: Cooper watches the Event Horizon fall farther and farther away. He checks his oxygen gauge. One tank full, one tank at half. Cooper twists his backpack around, giving him access to the oxygen tanks. He seals off his primary hose and disconnects the full tank. His gauge immediately goes to "Yellow - Reserve." Cooper points the full tank away from the Event Horizon and OPENS IT... The blast of pressurized air pushes him towards the ship, leaving the wreckage of the Lewis and Clark behind.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR
N: Miller races through the corridors to Medical...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
N: ...and finds DJ, suspended above the table, neatly dissected. His organs have been laid out carefully before him on the steel table.
C: MILLER
D: Oh my God.
N: DJ raises his head.
C: DJ
D: Please...
E: whisper
C: MILLER
D: Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
C: DJ
D: Please... kill...
C: MILLER
D: Oh God...
N: Miller raises the nailgun with trembling hands. FIRES.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE
N: Miller approaches the door to the Bridge. It is open...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Miller stands in the doorway. A figure sits at the helm. Miller aims the nailgun.
C: MILLER
D: Weir.
N: The figure doesn't move. Miller slowly circles around the helm... It's Starck. Bound with wire in a sadomasochistic pose, unconscious.
C: MILLER
D: Hold on... Get you outta these...
N: Miller kneels in front of her, puts down the nailgun, loosens the cords. She BREATHES in ragged gasps, opens his eyes... Then stops. She stares over Miller's shoulder like a deer caught in the headlights. Miller looks behind him... WEIR STANDS THERE, STARING WITH EYES SEWN SHUT. Miller reaches for the gun... Weir hits him, sending Miller across the bridge into a bulkhead. Weir picks up the nailgun, examines it. Miller slowly gets to his feet.
C: MILLER
D: Your eyes...
C: WEIR
D: I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
C: MILLER
D: What are you talking about?
C: WEIR
D: Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is? It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil. It's a liberating experience.
E: beat a dead man's grin
N: With his free hand, Weir reaches for the navigation console. Flips a series of switches with gore caked fingers.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE (ENLARGED CONSOLE)
N: The display lights up.
C: COMPUTER
D: Gravity drive primed. Do you wish to engage?
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
C: MILLER
D: What are you doing?
N: Weir grins as he flips the final switch.
C: COMPUTER
D: Gravity drive engaged. Activation in T-minus ten minutes.
N: Miller lunges for the nailgun. Weir raises the nailgun to point at Miller's face. Miller slowly backs away.
C: MILLER
D: If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
C: WEIR
D: What makes you think I'll miss?
N: Miller sees something out of the corner of his eye...
S: EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Cooper. Outside, braced in the viewport bracket.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Weir spins and FIRES at Cooper. The nail lodges in the thick quartz glass. A web of cracks spreads out from the bullet, the glass SHRIEKING under the pressure. Weir takes a step towards the window, raises the gun to fire again.
S: EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: Miller dives for the door. Before Weir can fire,
S: EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE WINDOW (HANGING SECTION)
N: the window EXPLODES outward.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
N: The ship HOWLS as air rushes out, ripping Weir off his feet. Weir catches himself in the broken window, trying to pull himself back in... A monitor tears free, SMASHES into him. HE IS SUCKED OUT. Miller pulls himself through the door as it begins to shut. He is safe...
C: STARCK
D: Don't leave me!
E: O.S.
N: Miller turns. Starck clings to a console, barely able to resist the winds that try to suck her into the void.
C: STARCK
D: Please... help, help me...
E: gasping for air
N: Miller hesitates, looking from Starck back into the safety of the ship. The door continues to shut. In seconds, he will be safe. And she will be dead. Miller YELLS and rips a compressor from its mount, wedges it in the door to keep it open. He keeps one hand on the door, reaches the other hand to Starck.
C: MILLER
D: Give me your hand! Your hand!
N: She does. Frost forms on their bodies as the air cools. Their veins begin to bulge, blood pulses from their noses. He YELLS with exertion... ...drags her to the door... through the door... ...as the compressor tears free, sucked into space... ...and the door SNAPS shut, missing them by a fraction.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE
N: Starck and Miller collapse against the door. A moment passes between them. Just happy to be breathing... ...and then the AIRLOCK KLAXON goes off.
C: MILLER
D: The forward airlock.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR
N: Starck and Miller race towards the Forward Airlock Bay.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - FORWARD AIRLOCK BAY NO. 4
N: They enter, see a humanoid shape moving in the strobing light of the airlock.
C: STARCK
D: Weir can't be alive.
C: MILLER
D: Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
N: Miller looks around for a weapon. Pulls a zero-G bolt cutter from the wall. Wields it like a bat.
C: MILLER
D: Stay behind me.
N: The inner airlock door releases with a HISS. Swings open... Cooper tumbles through, clawing at his helmet.
C: STARCK
D: Cooper!
N: Starck rushes to him, takes his helmet off. He SUCKS air in, COUGHS it out.
C: COOPER
D: Let me breathe, let me breathe...
C: STARCK
D: You're okay now, it's over...
C: MILLER
D: It's not over. It's just starting.
E: sees something
N: Starck follows Miller's gaze to a workstations's flashing display: GRAVITY DRIVE ENGAGED. ACTIVATION 00:06:43:01...
C: MILLER
D: Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
C: STARCK
D: We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
C: COOPER
D: How? The Bridge is gone.
C: STARCK
D: There must be a way! What about Engineering?
C: COOPER
D: Can you shut it down?
C: STARCK
D: I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
C: COOPER
D: I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
C: MILLER
D: BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
C: STARCK
D: Blow it up?
C: MILLER
D: We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
C: COOPER
D: ...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY
C: MILLER
D: You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
C: COOPER
D: Will it work?
C: MILLER
D: It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
N: Cooper nods, heads for the gravity couch bay. Starck follows Miller to the steel pressure door.
C: STARCK
D: I'll do it --
C: MILLER
D: No. I'll be right back.
N: Miller opens the door.
C: MILLER
D: Close it behind me. Just in case.
N: Beat. Starck stares at Miller as if memorizing his face.
C: STARCK
D: Don't be long.
N: Miller smiles wanly. The door slides shut with a dull THUNK.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS
N: Miller runs down the corridor. Stops at a bulkhead coupling. Kneels down to remove the cover from an explosive charge, switch it to MANUAL detonation. Miller runs to the next coupling. Repeats the process...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY
N: Starck and Cooper check the gravity couches. One by one, they slide open...
C: COOPER
D: I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
C: STARCK
D: Hurry.
N: Cooper exits down a ladder. Starck turns to the console, activates three gravity couches. Behind her, two begin to fill with blue gel... ...and one begins to fill with blood... the hint of dark shapes moving within... Starck doesn't see it, concentrates on the console. THUMP. THUMP. Starck turns. Sees the bloody tank. Sees something moving inside it. She slowly crosses to the tank. Peers at it...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY (TANK)
N: THUMP. A FACE PRESSES AGAINST THE GLASS, STARING BACK AT HER. WEIR. Bone and muscle are exposed where the skin hasn't finished forming.
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY
N: Starck SCREAMS and backs away.
C: STARCK
D: Cooper...!
N: The glass BURSTS in an EXPLOSION OF BLOOD...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR BELOW GRAVITY COUCH BAY
N: A corridor beneath the Gravity Couch Bay. Cooper searches through circuit panels until he finds the EMERGENCY BEACON breaker. He runs a by-pass, activating it manually. The lights begins to STROBE... DRIP. DRIP. A bloodstain spreads over his shoulder. He follows the drip to the ceiling...
C: COOPER
D: Starck?
N: No response. He slowly moves to peer up the ladder... ...as Starck CRASHES down, bloody but alive.
C: COOPER
D: What...?
C: STARCK
D: Run!
N: She shoves him away... Weir appears at the top of the ladder, crawling down headfirst like a spider... Starck gets to her feet, staggers away...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST
N: CONTAINTMENT Miller kneels, removing the cover from the last explosive. Flips a switch. A small cover pops open. Miller reaches in, removes a RADIO DETONATOR. He arms the explosives. Watches the red lights on the explosives wink on in the darkness. He reaches for an intercom.
C: MILLER
D: We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR - (INTERSECTION)
C: MILLER
D: ...repeat, we're armed...

C: STARCK
D: You have to get back here now, he's out there now, if he finds you...

S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

C: BURNING MAN
D: Do you remember me?
C: MILLER
D: Corrick...
C: BURNING MAN
D: You left me behind.
C: MILLER
D: That's not true...
C: BURNING MAN
D: I begged you. I begged you to save me and you did nothing. You stood there and watched me burn...
C: MILLER
D: SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
N: The Burning Man YELLS and raises his arm in accusation... ...and FIRE RACES OUT FROM BEHIND HIM, flowing over the walls, the ceiling, the floor, racing for Miller like a rising tide...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST
N: CONTAINMENT Miller runs. Dead ahead, the First Containment...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT
N: Miller runs fast. The fire is faster, flooding in behind him. Miller dashes for the Second Seal as IT BEGINS TO CLOSE. The fire gains on him, surrounding him. Miller dives through the Second Seal...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: ...barely makes it... ...SLAMS into the engineering console. Miller looks back at the Second Seal. It's still open by a fraction when the fire hits it... ...SENDING A LANCE OF FLAME stabbing out towards Miller. He rolls aside as the fire hits the console. The console EXPLODES. The Second Seal shuts tight, cutting the fire off. The paint on the Second Seal begins to bubble and scorch... and then cools as the fire subsides. Miller gets to his feet. Almost allows himself to relax. Then he sees his shadow before him, dancing in the growing red light. He turns...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: The Second Containment is a holocaust. Fire swarms over the walls. Burning jelly drips from Control Spikes. The Core itself is a blazing orb; the gyroscope that holds it glows red-hot. Miller stares at the blazing Core.
C: BURNING MAN
D: Don't leave me!
E: O.S.
N: Miller turns. The Burning Man stands RIGHT BESIDE HIM. He SMASHES Miller with a backhand that ignites Miller's clothes and sends him flying. The detonator falls from Miller's grasp, lost beneath two feet of coolant. Miller comes up CHOKING and SPLUTTERING. The Burning Man stalks towards Miller. The coolant STEAMS and SIZZLES at his feet. Miller stares at the Burning Man as he approaches. Slowly rises to his feet.
C: MILLER
D: You're not Edmund Corrick.
N: The Burning Man's flames wane, revealing Weir's misshapen form. Miller throws a wicked right. Weir catches Miller's fist. SQUEEZES until blood wells up between his fingers. Then slings Miller against a cooling tank with BONE CRACKING force. Miller collapses into the slime, barely able to raise his head to breathe. Weir slowly approaches.
C: MILLER
D: What are you?
C: WEIR
D: You know.
C: MILLER
D: You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
C: WEIR
D: I'm not the Devil.

D: Then what, what are you? Tell me...

S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT (VISIONS FROM HELL)
N: Peters' bloody grinning child, devouring his mother...
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
N: MILLER writhes in Weir's grip. His hands flail out to the sides. One hand brushes a long steel cannister sunk in the muck. A CO2 scrubber... THE VISIONS CONTINUE:
S: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE (VISIONS FROM HELL)
N: DJ's dissected body, except that here, DJ looks up, and smiles...
S: EXT. SPACE - MODEL (VISIONS FROM HELL)

D: NO!
N: His hand closes on the scrubber and he swings it across Weir's head. Weir reels back, stunned. Miller gets to his feet.
C: MILLER
D: You can't have them!
N: He hits Weir again. HARD. Blood gushes from Weir's skull, filling the runes on his face. Weir staggers. Miller attacks. Again and again and again... This time Weir is ready. He catches the scrubber and tears it from Miller's grasp. SMASHES Miller to the floor with a single blow. Miller GROANS.
C: WEIR
D: I'm not the Devil. I'm much, much older. I watched the Beginning and I will see the End. I am the dark behind the stars. I am the dark inside you all.
N: Miller gets to all fours, trying to get up.
C: MILLER
D: ...not the Devil...
N: Weir kicks Miller savagely. Miller slides through the coolant, comes to rest beneath a walkway. He attempts to rise, collapses back into the sludge. Weir slowly stalks towards him.
C: WEIR
D: There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
C: MILLER
D: You're lying...!
