M: Kids
M: Harmony Korine
M: BLACK SCREEN
M: The very loud sound of people having sex. The sounds of deep moaning and sexual huffs and puffs. After a few seconds the sound grows even louder. It should sound as if the two people are fucking into a microphone. The sounds should be painful and raw.
M: GIRL (O.S.)
M: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.
S: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
N: The face of a very pretty young girl with long blond hair. Her face is inches from the CAMERA, the CAMERA is above her, looking down, almost like the POV of the person she's having sex with. She id breathing extremely heavily; her face is red-hot and sweaty. Every time she moves, she makes a deep moaning noise. She looks likes she's on the verge of pain and ecstasy.
C: GIRL
D: Oh yes, Telly it hurts, oh yes, oh yes, please Telly, Telly.
N: The CAMERA backs up to reveal Telly having sex with the girl. Telly is seventeen years old. He is short, dirty, slightly muscular, he has an interesting face, he is a street-smart punk, He is biting his bottom lip, the two of them are sweating like mad, the sound of the bed post smashing against the wall combines with the rhythmical moaning of the two.
T: RAPID FADE TO BLACK
N: BACK IN TIME - BEFORE THEY HAD SEX Telly is in bed with the girl. The two of them are sitting up in the big bed that is raised high of the ground. Telly is naked except for a tight pair of white underwater. He is sitting above the blankets with his legs spread apart. The girl is partially covered, she is wearing a black bra, one of her nipples is poking through. The two of them are very sweaty, they both have messed up hair, there is a great feeling of heat and wetness. The windows to her room are open, the sound of outside of outside traffic is circulating. There is a small fan on her dresser that is blowing from side to side. Socks, shirts, and pants are lying on her hard wood floor. The room is neat except for the clothing. A large poster of the Beastie Boys hangs on the wall. She has many stuffed animals on her bed and dresser drawer, she also has a small dollhouse in the corner. Telly and the girl are looking at each other. The girl speaks slowly and softly, she has a very innocent beauty about her.

C: GIRL
D: Why is that?
C: TELLY

C: GIRL
D: But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.

E: whispering
T: RAPID CUT TO BLACK
N: AN EXTREME CLOSEUP OF THE GIRL'S FACE As she screams in total agony. Telly and the girl are on the bed having sex. All the lights are on. This scene should look very white and bleached out, very electric and shocking. Everything should be exposed as Telly takes advantage of the virgin girl.
C: TELLY
D: Virgins. I love 'em. No diseases, no loose as a goose pussy, no skank. No nothin. Just pure pleasure.
E: V.O. slowly
T: CUT TO BLACK
N: THE CREDITS ROLL IN As soon as the scene ends, so does the sound of the two having sex. Very fast, very hard-paced music accompanies the credits. The music should be strong enough to maintain the intensity of the scene, Hard-core, Punk. CREDITS STOP
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRCASE - DAY
N: Telly gently shuts the door. He has a huge smile on his face. He looks down the center of the staircase and spits. He watches his spit fall down till it smacks against the floor. He runs down three flights of stairs as quickly as possible. He jumps down the last four steps and bumps into the side of the wall. He is very happy. He runs down the skinny hallway and smacks the metal mailboxes.
S: EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - SIDEWALK - DAY
N: Telly exits the building. CASPER is sitting on a middle step. He is reading a comic book and drinking a 40oz. Bottle of malt liquor. The bottle is wrapped in a brown paper sack. As he sips his drink he laughs at his comic book. Casper is Telly's second half. The two have been best friends since grade school. Casper is small and funny, everyone likes him, he has a quick temper, and he isn't scared to fight someone twice his size. Telly provides Casper with a sense of adolescent wisdom. Casper makes Telly happy; he's a smart ass, he has a strong New York accent, an assortment of tattoos, and crooked teeth. Telly and Casper are always together, They help each other to survive. Telly smacks Casper on the back of his head. Casper is startled and spills a little bit of his beer onto his shoes.
C: CASPER
D: Shit.
C: TELLY
D: Was up bitch?
E: smiling
N: Casper looks at Telly smiling.
C: CASPER
D: Oh shit what happened?
N: Casper is very excited. He stands up and pulls Telly's arm.
C: TELLY
D: What do you think?
C: CASPER
D: You fucked it?
N: Telly laughs and Casper jumps up and down.
C: CASPER
D: I knew you fucked it! I sat out her for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
C: TELLY
D: Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
E: pounding his chest
N: They both start to laugh. They move off the stairs and start walking down the sidewalk. The two of them are walking down the street, obvious to everything but themselves talking.
C: CASPER
D: Well, how was it?
C: TELLY
D: Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
C: CASPER
D: She can fuck?
C: TELLY
D: Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
C: CASPER
D: Oh shit. How long did it take?
C: TELLY
D: Did what take?
C: CASPER
D: How long did you fuck her?
N: They cross the street, paying no attention to speeding cars. Casper is listening to every word that Telly says. Casper seems much happier than Telly. Telly is laid-back. Casper is hyper as he jumps up and down and claws Telly's arm.
C: TELLY
D: Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
C: CASPER
D: Yeah.
C: TELLY
D: But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
C: CASPER
D: How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
N: Telly puts his four fingers together and then puts his hand in front of Caper's nose.
C: TELLY
D: Take a whiff.
N: Casper takes a huge whiff, the snot in his nose makes a loud sound as he smells Telly's fingers.
C: CASPER
D: Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
C: TELLY
D: Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
C: CASPER
D: Oh man, that's the best.
C: TELLY
D: You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
C: CASPER
D: Let me smell it again.
N: Telly lifts his fingers once again, as Casper breathes in the odor.
C: CASPER
D: That's why virgins are the best. I love that smell.
N: As they walk down the street, joggers, men in business suits with briefcases, ambulances, and women with baby carriages all pass by.
C: TELLY
D: You know what else?
C: CASPER
D: What?
C: TELLY
D: I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
C: CASPER
D: How?
C: TELLY
D: Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
C: CASPER
D: Right.
C: TELLY
D: And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cut when you were little.
C: CASPER
D: Yeah.
C: TELLY
D: And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.
N: Casper starts to crack up.
C: TELLY
D: And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
C: CASPER
D: Yeah.
C: TELLY
D: And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
N: They both laugh.
C: CASPER
D: Fuckin perverted bastard.
N: They continue to laugh and walk.
C: TELLY
D: I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
C: CASPER
D: To what? Virgins?
C: TELLY
D: Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
C: CASPER
D: What do you mean?
C: TELLY
D: I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
C: CASPER
D: You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
C: TELLY
D: That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
E: laughing
C: CASPER
D: She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
E: laughing
C: TELLY
D: I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
C: CASPER
D: Did you tell her that you loved her?
C: TELLY
D: Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
N: They stop walking. Casper takes the last sip of his beer, then throws it toward an orange trash can. He misses the can and the bottle smashes in the middle of a busy street.
C: CASPER
D: Shit.
C: TELLY
D: What do you want?
C: CASPER
D: Get another forty. Smoke a blunt.
E: burps
C: TELLY
D: Are you hungry?
C: CASPER
D: Hell yeah. Fuckin starvin. Wait up a sec.
N: Casper takes two steps away and starts urinating in someone's bushes. People walk by and stare.
C: TELLY
D: You wanna go to Paul's house?
C: CASPER
D: What for? That guys a dick.
C: TELLY
D: I'm sue he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
C: CASPER
D: You think he's got any herb?
C: TELLY
D: I don't know, he quit dealin but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
C: CASPER
D: You think?
C: TELLY
D: Probably.
C: CASPER
D: He lives on 76th?
C: TELLY
D: 78th.
C: CASPER
D: Den less go Joe.
N: He zips up his pants. They start walking again. Casper is carrying a folded up comic book in his hand.
C: CASPER
D: Telly.
C: TELLY
D: Yeah.
C: CASPER
D: Did she suck your dick?
C: TELLY
D: A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
C: CASPER
D: Why?
C: TELLY
D: I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
C: CASPER
D: It is right.
C: TELLY
D: I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
C: CASPER
D: It's no big deal, right?
C: TELLY
D: Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
C: CASPER
D: Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is. It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
E: they both start laughing
C: TELLY
D: Yep.
C: CASPER
D: They're gonna tell their grand kids. That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
E: mimicking an old lady
N: The two of them are laughing, their conversation has gotten them very excited. They walk in front of a Korean grocery. The grocery has a small outdoor produce section, juice, fruit, sodas, etc. A KOREAN GUY with flip-flops and headphones is sitting on a tall wooden stool.
C: TELLY
D: You thirsty?
C: CASPER
D: Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
C: TELLY
D: You got any money?
C: CASPER
D: Three pennies and a ball of lint.
C: TELLY
D: You down with the boost?
C: CASPER
D: Unzip my pack, yo.
E: whispers
N: He turns around and Telly quickly unzips his backpack.
S: INT. KOREAN GROCERY - DAY
N: The grocery is your basic traditional market with a lunch buffet. Behind the cash register is a middle-aged KOREAN MAN. He is watching a small black and white television set. The two boys enter. Casper walks straight to the back where they keep the beer. Telly circles the buffet and then walks up to the cash register.

C: CASPER
D: He said This Dick, mutha fucka! Can't you understand English?
N: The two of them both run out the door. Telly taps the Korean man who is sitting outside. The man looks in the opposite direction while Casper grabs two peaches and puts them into his pocket. The two boys run off. The Korean man gets off his stool. He pulls his headphones off his ears.
C: KOREAN MAN
D: Stupy fucky boys! Fucky!
N: He looks at his fruit stand and puts a peach in the spot that Casper previously stole from.
S: EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - APARTMENT - DAY

C: CASPER
D: Oh man. I fucking love this guy.
N: The two of them walk off laughing.
S: EXT. PAUL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
N: A medium sized apartment building on the Upper East Side. Cars are speeding by the front of the building. Cabs drive by and beep their horns. Telly and Casper are sitting on the front steps. Telly rings one of the buttons. The bottom switchboard is plastered with skateboarding stickers and "Legalize Marijuana" stickers. A Vespa scooter is parked on the outside in front of the building, it also has stickers on it. Telly rings it again. It is a very hot day, both boys are wiping sweat from their bodies.

S: INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
N: There are about ten guys in the apartment. There is almost no furniture, just two white couches and a few plants in the corner. There is a big TV in the center of the floor. A Nintendo with several wires is hooked up to it. There are various games spread out. A couple of boys are huddled around the game, as they watch the guy play, they breathe in the wip-it's. The boys are all young and spread out. There are people lying on the couch, on the floor, on the phone, in the kitchen smoking pot and doing wip-its. They are all colors and sizes. Casper and Telly go to each person and greet them with a handshake. Some people they hug. They say "Was up," to everyone. They both sit down on the floor and continue to drink their beers. Paul sits down besides them.
C: PAUL
D: What are you guys doing?

C: PAUL
D: You want a wip-it?

C: PAUL
D: They're good for you. Vitamin C for the new generation.
N: Paul hands Casper another cartridge.
C: CASPER
D: That's why I like 'em. They wake my brain up.
N: Casper does the wip-it. STANLEY, a tall black kid with dreads, walks out of the kitchen. He has a cordless phone in his hand. Casper continues to do wip-it's. One after another.
C: TELLY
D: So, how many people live here now?
C: PAUL
D: I don't know, eight or nine.
C: TELLY
D: Where does everyone sleep?

An assortment of men and women of different races and colors. They look mainly middle class. Jennie and Ruby are the youngest people in the room. A man in a three-piece suit slowly walks by. Jennie tries to see his face but he is turned the wrong way. Ruby continues to talk. The same fat black nurse walks out with a clipboard. She begins to cough tremendously.
C: RUBY
D: ... I don't know, I think he's mad at me, but who cares...
N: Ruby and Jennie stop talking and look at the black nurse. She is coughing uncontrollably. She looks like a large shaking figure. A skinny nurse walks by, pounds her on the back, and she stops coughing. The black nurse has a smile on her face, her eyes watery. She turns and looks at Ruby.

C: TELLY
D: And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on.
N: Casper starts laughing.
C: TELLY
D: I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
C: CASPER
D: I know what you mean.
C: TELLY
D: At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
C: CASPER

C: CASPER
D: You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
C: TELLY
D: I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
N: At this point the sound of the subway door is heard. A black man with no legs pushes himself through with his hands. He has a large container filled with change. As he enters, his cup of change is heard smashing back and forth. His face is even with people's knees. A random few stuff change and dollar bills into his cup. He sings as he pushes his way through the cat. He has an afro pick sticking out the back of his head. He is wearing a shirt that says "KISS ME I'M POLISH".
C: LEGLESS MAN
D: I have no legs. I have no legs. I have no legs. I have no legs.
E: singing
N: As he pushes his way closer, Casper starts checking his all his pockets. When he gets about three feet away, Casper stands up and throws some pennies into his cup. He sits back down next to Telly. The legless man stops and smiles at Casper.
C: LEGLESS MAN
D: Thank you. God bless you.
C: CASPER
D: Yeah. Bless you back.
N: The legless man makes his way into the next car.
C: TELLY
D: I don't understand why you do that.

C: TELLY
D: That.
C: CASPER

E: motions to his waist
C: TELLY
D: That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
C: CASPER
D: What are you talking about?
C: TELLY
D: Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
C: CASPER
D: So.
C: TELLY
D: So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
C: CASPER
D: So. You never know when you can end up like that.
C: TELLY
D: Right.
C: CASPER
D: I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
C: TELLY
D: Shut up.
C: CASPER
D: I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.

C: LITTLE GIRL
D: My dolly is black... Lucy.
N: The girl sticks her doll out so Jennie can hold it.
S: EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY
N: Casper and Telly are standing by the chess tables. The park is very busy. Every chess table is being used. People are riding bikes and roller-blading. Strong men are doing pull-ups on the monkey bars while guys walk by with ghetto blasters. A state of public frenzy. A Rastafarian drug dealer with a big dread cap is standing a little bit away from Telly and Casper. He is approaching everyone as they walk by him.

C: CASPER
D: Thanks Ras.
C: RAS
D: Caspa!!!
N: Ras laughs. The two of them slap hands. Ras slaps Telly's hand and walks away.
S: EXT. UNDER THE ARCH - WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY
N: The park is extremely crowded. The kids hang out in front of the arch by the fountain and around the sides. There are about ten kids skateboarding. The fountain is on and the mist is spraying the kids. Girls in hip-hop fashion are lined up all around. A few kids are drawing graffiti in little black books. There are maybe twenty kids hanging out around the fountain, in front of the arch. Casper and Telly walk up to the center of the action. They greet their friends sitting on the edge of the fountain. Skateboarders ride up and slap their hands. As they greet their friends, they kiss the girls on the cheek and a few of them on the lips, they slap hands with the guys and embrace some with a hug. Telly and Casper go down the line, greeting everyone. This process takes a while, as they interact with everyone down the line. HAROLD is a skinny black skateboarder with a funny face. He rides up to Casper and hugs him.

C: HAMILTON
D: Yo Cass, you got any boom?
N: Telly is sitting on the cement benches talking to MISHA, a pretty young girl with a belly button pierce.
C: CASPER
D: Yep. You got a Phillie?
C: HAMILTON
D: Presto.
N: Hamilton pulls out a long Phillie cigar. Then he squeezes in between Casper and another guy. Casper pulls out his dime bag and sniffs it. The he puts it in front of Hamilton's nose.
C: HAMILTON
D: You got that here in the park?
C: CASPER
D: Yep.
C: HAMILTON
D: Break that shit up.
N: Casper is smushing the pot up. Hamilton is taking the plastic of the cigar. In this shot they go through the complete process of rolling a blunt. The next sequence should be done with fast edits.
C: HAMILTON
D: Cut it.
N: Hamilton cuts the cigar down the center with his long thumbnail.
C: HAMILTON
D: Scrape it.
N: He then scrapes all the tobacco out of the center and onto the ground.
C: HAMILTON

N: He then licks the outer paper till it gets very damp.
C: HAMILTON

N: Hamilton puts it in his mouth.
C: HAMILTON
D: You wanna start off?
N: Hamilton looks at Casper and puts the blunt in his face.
C: CASPER
D: Naw, you got it Ham.
N: Hamilton smiles.
C: HAMILTON
D: All right.
N: He puts the blunt in his mouth and lights it. A big flame shoots up as it catches the end of the Phillie. Hamilton takes a few big puffs and then blows the smoke away.
C: HAMILTON
D: Take two pulls and pass.
N: Hamilton passes the blunt to Casper. A bunch of kids start huddling around Casper as he puffs. STEVEN, a skinny Spanish kid with gold front teeth, walks up.
C: STEVEN
D: Yo can I fuck wit dat?
N: Casper smiles and blows smoke in his face.
C: CASPER
D: Yeah boy!
N: Casper hits it again and then hands it to Steve, who takes immense hits. Two male homosexuals in short shorts walk by holding hands. Steven turns his head and notices them. He exhales the smoke out of his nose.
C: STEVEN
D: Look at that.
C: HAROLD
D: That shit is sick. Fuckin faggots.

S: EXT. NEW YORK SIDEWALK - DAY
N: Back in time. Casper is a little boy, age 11. He is walking down the sidewalk with a lunch box and a "Casper the Friendly Ghost" T-shirt. He is wearing his hat on backwards. Music accompanies this entire episode.
C: TELLY
D: Well, one day Casper had a stomachache and he got permission from his teacher to leave school early and go home.
E: V.O.
N: Casper walks up to a nice middle-class home, it could be in Queens or Brooklyn, it doesn't matter. He pulls out a key and opens the door. He enters his home.
S: INT. CASPER'S HOUSE - DAY
N: The house is dark. Plastic on all the furniture. A velvet picture of Christ is hanging on the wall in the hallway. Very simple and plain, a generic adobe. Casper enters his house and flips on a lightswitch.
C: TELLY
D: So he walks into his house and hears some strange noises.
E: V.O.
N: The sounds of his mother screaming from upstairs.
C: CASPER'S MOM
D: Get away! Get away! Help! You monster! Please help!
E: screaming from upstairs
N: Casper puts his lunch box down and walks to the first stair to listen to his mother's screams.
C: TELLY
D: The noises were coming from upstairs. In his parents room.
E: V.O.
N: Casper's mom continues to scream from upstairs.
C: TELLY
D: So, this freaked the hell out of Casper. He was just a little kid and he wasn't sure what to do.
E: V.O.
N: Casper moves off the step and runs into the kitchen.
C: TELLY
D: So he ran and got a big knife. The same knife his pops used to cut the turkey on Thanksgiving with.
E: V.O.
N: He opens a drawer full of silverware and pulls out a humongous glistening knife. He picks it up, and it shines on his face. As his mother screams he looks up at the ceiling with the knife in his hand.
C: CASPER'S MOM
D: Stop! Please stop! Oooh help!
E: screaming from upstairs
N: Casper runs up the stairs, he is holding the knife straight out.
C: TELLY
D: So he heard his mom's screams, and knew that she was in trouble. It sounded like she was getting ready to be killed. Like someone was kicking her in the head.
E: V.O.
N: Casper runs down the hall and opens the door to his parents room. What he sees is very shocking. His face becomes extremely animated. Casper's mom is on the bed. She is completely naked except for a pair of bright red high heel shoes. In between her legs is a man wearing all black, including a black ski mask and motorcycle boots. He is having sex with Casper's mom. He has her arms pinned down on the bed. He is grunting like a pig. Casper watches for a moment in awe.
C: MAN IN BLACK
D: Bitch. You fuckin bitch. Fuckin bitch. Slutty whore.
N: The man in black slaps Casper's mom hard on her naked ass.
C: CASPER'S MOM
D: No! Stop! Get off me!
E: screaming
N: She is struggling to get loose.
C: TELLY
D: So Casper opened the door and he saw some big guy with a ski mask fucking his mother. What a sight for an 11 year old kid.
E: V.O.
N: Casper runs up to the bed. He climbs on top of the bed with the big knife in the air, all the while the man in black is having sex with his mother. And they don't even notice Casper at first.
C: TELLY
D: And he goes and jumps on his parent's bed. And for a second he just looks and watches.
E: V.O.
N: Casper takes his knife and starts stabbing the guy in black, over and over. His mother is kicking and trying to stop him. All the while, she is screaming outrageously and blood is pouring out.
C: TELLY
D: And you know. Casper loved his mom, he didn't want anything to happen to her. So he started stabbing this guy, over and over. But it was a mistake.
E: V.O.
N: Casper's mom is kicking Casper as he stabs the man. Casper is biting his tongue as he stabs the man. The man falls off the bed and onto the floor. Casper's mom is going totally nuts. She is completely naked, with blood all over her body. There is blood all over the sheets. His mom is clawing her face in complete hysterics.
C: CASPER'S MOM
D: You fuck!!! It's your father!!! We were playing a game you fuck!!! That's your father!!! We were just playing!!!
N: Casper looks very confused as he looks at his naked mother. He has the knife in his hand, and a little blood on his T-shirt and cheek. Casper's mom continues to yell at him.
C: CASPER'S MOM
D: Casper, you fucker!!! Oh, my god!!! Help me God!!!
N: Casper looks at his mother, then he looks at the dead guy on the floor. He bends down and takes off the mask. It's his father.
C: CASPER
D: That's my dad.
E: calmly
C: CASPER'S MOM
D: You fuck. You killed your father!
E: crying
C: TELLY
D: So Casper killed his father. He came home with a stomachache and ended up murdering his pops. It was a very embarrassing thing.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - ON A CEMENT BENCH - DAY
N: Telly is in the same spot talking to Misha.
C: TELLY
D: So that's why Casper is how he is.
C: MISHA
D: Oh god. That's horrible.
N: A quick shot of Casper smoking a blunt and laughing with his friends.
C: TELLY
D: Yep.
C: MISHA
D: Holy shi. That's all true?
C: TELLY
D: No. I was just kidding.
C: MISHA
D: What?!
E: outraged
C: TELLY
D: I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
S: EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - ON THE FOUNTAIN - DAY
N: Casper and all his friends are passing around the blunt, which by now is almost gone. All that is left is a roach and Casper is sucking on it really hard. Casper breathes out the smoke and then passes the roach to Hamilton.
C: CASPER
D: Yo, that weed is mad good.
N: Hamilton gets ready to puff.
C: HAMILTON
D: Hells yeah. Gimmie a taste of the mothafuckin chronic.
N: Casper rubs his eyes. Hamilton puffs on the little roach. Casper grabs somebody's skateboard and stands on it. He starts rolling around slowly and doing some tricks. The other kids continue to smoke. They watch Casper and laugh. Casper is slowly trying to do tricks, but he's so stoned that he just falls off. As he skates in front of is friends he doesn't pay any attention to where he's going. A tall HOODLUM with gold front teeth is walking by. He is wearing all Polo and a thick white Fila headband. He is biting down on a chew stick. The hoodlum walks by. He has a certain ominous strut. He is looking at the ground as he walks. He takes the chew stick out of his mouth and looks at some girl's ass as she walks by. He makes a little noise with his mouth. As the hoodlum walks by, Casper is rolling backward, not paying attention. He rolls into the hoodlum's heels. Casper falls down and laughs. Everyone watching laughs, including Telly who is still sitting with Misha. Casper jumps up and grabs his skateboard. The hoodlum is turned around. Casper walks up to him with a smile.
C: CASPER
D: Yo, sorry money.
N: The hoodlum is a good seven inches taller than Casper. He puts his arms out like he's upset.
C: HOODLUM
D: Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
C: CASPER
D: Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
E: smiling
C: HOODLUM
D: What?
C: CASPER
D: Nuffin G. Just forget it.
C: HOODLUM
D: What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
N: Casper throws his skateboard down. He quickly turns around and pulls his pants up. He runs right up to the hoodlum and he looks up at him.
C: CASPER
D: Sup then? Sup?
C: HOODLUM
D: Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
S: EXT. THE CEMENT BENCHES - DAY
N: Telly and Misha are watching. Telly stands up.
C: TELLY
D: Uh oh. Casper's in the mix.
N: He quickly walks up.
S: EXT. THE FOUNTAIN - DAY
N: All the guys jump up and start screaming.
C: STEVEN
D: Oh shit. Throw down.
N: Steven and all the guys run up and surround the hoodlum. They all start screaming taunts. "Fuck 'em up Casper!" Casper is inches from the hoodlum. They are both in a fighting stance. Casper keeps pulling his pants up. Casper has a huge smile on his face, like this is his favorite thing in the whole world.
C: CASPER
D: Sup. Sup.
C: HOODLUM
D: Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
C: CASPER
D: I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
N: They are both right about to swing. Everyone in the whole park has turned their attention to the scuffle. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Harold runs up behind the Hoodlum and with the truck of his skateboard, smashes the guy in the back of the head. A huge thud is heard and the hoodlum just kinda falls forward on his knees. Casper, with a big smile, steps back and kicks the guy in the face as hard as he can. Everyone gets in a big circle around the fallen hoodlum. They're all screaming. Even the girls are screaming. "Fuck 'em up!" Harold continues hitting the hoodlum with his skateboard. Hitting him on the legs and stomach. Casper is jumping up and down on the hoodlum's head.
C: CASPER
D: Suck my dick! Suck my dick! Suck my dick!
E: everytime he kicks the guy he says this
N: All of a sudden, all the skateboarders in the park, including Hamilton and Steven, take their boards and start smashing this guy, over and over. The hoodlum is on the ground holding his head, as everyone frantically tries to kill him. The focus should be on the face of the skateboarders. How much they are enjoying this. They continue to pound him, over and over, like animals in on the prey. This should look very scary, as twenty guys try to kill the fallen hoodlum. Even little kids are in the middle, beating the guy. Telly looks up to the sky. He makes a loud noise as he clears his throat, like he's gathering mucus. Then he puts his arms down and stops some of the kids from hitting the hoodlum. His face is completely cracked and bloody. Telly steps over him and spits a huge phlegm wad onto his face. Casper, still smiling, kicks the guy in the face.
C: CASPER
D: Suck my dick, Suck my dick. Suck my dick.
N: Everyone stops kicking the guy and they all get kinda silent and look at him. He looks completely twisted, bloody, and dead. Casper bends over, right in his face.
C: CASPER
D: Now get in my way! Bitch.
E: smiling
T: CUT TO BLACK
S: INT. / EXT. TAXICAB - GOING DOWNTOWN - EVENING
N: Jennie is in the back of a speeding cab. She is looking out the window. Her face looks sad. The TAXI DRIVER is a funny looking old man. He's wearing a jockey hat and a Hawaiian shirt. He has air fresheners hanging from the mirror. He is chewing on a big wet cigar. He has a half shaved beard. He looks like a dirty old man. Jennie looks dazed. As the taxi driver drives, he looks in his mirror at Jennie. He pulls his cigar out of his mouth and then puts it back in. Jazz is playing on the radio.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Excuse me. Can I ask you a question?
N: Jennie just shrugs.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
C: JENNIE
D: What?
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin maybe.
N: As the taxi driver talks, he looks in the mirror, and then looks at the road. He is driving fast and clumsy. He pulls out his cigar and then puts it back in his mouth.
C: JENNIE
D: No. I'm OK. Thanks.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: You're OK?
C: JENNIE
D: Yeah.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean your a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
C: JENNIE
D: Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
N: The taxi driver begins to laugh a really squeaky laugh.
C: JENNIE
D: Sorry.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
N: Jennie continues to look glumly out the window.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: You know. I could tell you were sad by the way your eyes drooped. Like an adopted kid. That's the way an adopted kid's eyes look. All sad like that. All droopy and sweet. Like the honey that I lick off my finger.
N: He starts to laugh. Jennie continues to look sadly out the window.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Would I be prying if I asked you what was wrong?
N: Jennie is silent.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Miss, would I be prying?
C: JENNIE
D: Everything is wrong.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
C: JENNIE
D: Yeah, I guess so.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
C: JENNIE
D: No.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Are you in trouble with the law?
C: JENNIE
D: No.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Am I getting warm?
N: Jennie smiles. The taxi driver looks in the mirror and sees Jennie smiling.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
C: JENNIE
D: Yeah?
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
C: JENNIE
D: Thanks.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
N: He stops at a red light and turns around to look at her.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Hey look. Whatever it is. Just forget about it. Life's too short. Make yourself happy. I'll give you an example. When my golden retriever passed away. God rest his soul. I was lonesome. I missed him. So I got a tattoo.
E: he punches the roof of the cab
N: He pulls up his shirt and reveals a tattoo of a dog on his forearm. It says "Bruno" in big letters.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Now how do you like that? Now he's with me forever.
N: The light turns and he starts driving.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
C: JENNIE
D: Yeah?
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
C: JENNIE
D: What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
N: He starts to laugh. A quick shot of his identification badge. He has a really goofy smile and he's wearing the same Hawaiian shirt.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: That's life.
N: Jennie is smiling.
C: JENNIE
D: Your a real philosopher.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
N: He pulls up on Washington Square Park. He slams on the brakes and turns around in his seat.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Well here we are, Miss.
N: Jennie pulls some money out.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Aw, don't worry 'bout it. The rides on me.
N: Jennie has the money up to the glass.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: All right, all right, I'll take it. But forget about the tip.
N: He takes her money.
C: JENNIE
D: Thanks. Bye.
N: The taxi driver sticks his head out the window.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Oh yeah. Oh Miss. Miss. When you smile, God notices. That's why the sun is shining.
N: He points up to the sky before pulling away.
