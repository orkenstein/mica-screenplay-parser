MACHETE sideswipes the first THUG with his MACHETE, swinging him around to face the fire of the others.

Machete spins around and the girl unloads another spray.
C: CHICA
D: Oh... wow.
S: INT. MEXICAN HOTEL, LOBBY
N: The Uzi's out of ammo. The girl frowns and drops it. The fucked-up patrolcar blocks the way out, for now. Machete resheathes his weapon into a slit in his pants. Girl arches her back, her crotch in Machete's face, then slides down his front, her breasts brushing his eyes, nose, mouth.
C: MACHETE
D: We need to go. Now.
C: CHICA

Scrambles but can't get to his feet as he sees the outline of a DARK FIGURE above him. Young illegals' prayers continue as the MACHETE comes down on 2nd MINUTEMAN. Sounds of struggle, slaughter... then silence.
C: MACHETE
D: Light a candle... Say a prayer...
N: Young illegal opens eyes... There's a glass candle in his hands, but no one else around. Instead of Christ or a Virgin on the candle is a silhouette of MACHETE...
