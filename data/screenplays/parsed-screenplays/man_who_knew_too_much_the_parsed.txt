N: The bus rolls on past the Arab village into the open desert once again. It looks parched and grim.
S: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: Tired of watching the sameness of the desert, Hank grows, restless. He looks about for something to do. Ben leans back against the seat and closes his eyes. Jo takes a paper-bound novel out of her bag, finds her place. Hank decides to wander down the aisle of the bus and test its possibilities for adventure. The CAMERA DOLLIES BACK with him as he rather aimlessly makes for the front of the bus,. Having left the Arab village, the bus picks up speed, and is beginning to bump and sway somewhat. When Hank is a little better than half way down the aisle, the bus sways in a particularly startling manner, causing Hank to stagger. In order to steady himself, he thrusts out his hand to grab the side of a seat. He misses the seat, and only succeeds in clutching at the veil of an Arab woman. Unfortunately, he pulls the veil from her face.

S: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
N: The woman still covers her face, but from the seat next to her, and nearer the window, an Arab rises and makes a sharp comment in Arabic to Hank. The Arab's robes are brown, with a turban-like hat combining twisted strands of white and pale green cloth, The Arab starts to move past the woman, toward Hank, repeating his demand.
S: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

N: Ben rises quickly and advances protectively toward his son and the oncoming Arab.
S: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

N: The Arab continues pointing, talking.
S: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

C: LOUIS
D: Pardon me.
E: To Ben
N: He turns to the Arab, moves him back a little, sharply silences his attack, and then begins, in Arabic, to explain firmly that the boy meant, no harm. It was an accident. The Arab isn't convinced, points to Hank.
S: INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: The Frenchman leans toward Hank and takes the veil he is still unconsciously holding. He hands it to the Arab with a sharp command to return to his seat. The Arab turns away carrying the veil. As the CAMERA PANS him AWAY, we see the spectators resuming their seats, growing quiet.

D: That's all right. We tried everything to got rid of them. We never thought of a Frenchman.
N: Even Jo has to laugh at this, and as the bus continues on into Marrakesh, the three see to be fairly good friends brought together by the artless charm of a little boy. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 10.
S: EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

S: EXT. BUS STOP - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT
N: The bus pulls up to a stop, the door opens, and the passengers begin to file out. The McKennas, together with Louis Bernard, are the last off the bus. Arab helpers have already climbed to the roof of the bus, to unload the baggage. The clean-cut airline baggage of the McKennas is in sharp contrast to the Hessianroped bundles of the Arabs. There are nearby fiacres to take the people to their various destinations in the city, and some small, undersized taxi cabs.

C: LOUIS
D: But I know Marrakesh. I can show you an intriguing Arab restaurant where the food is different, and the manner of eating exotic.
C: BEN
D: Well -- that's what we came here for. Okay, Jo? Simple one of those Arabian Nights?

We cannot see the face. Jo switches on a light, which reveals a rather studious looking man of medium height standing there.

C: LOUIS
D: May I use your telephone?
E: To Ben
N: Ben gestures that the phone is his. The CAMERA PANS Louis to the phone, which he picks up, and begins talking in French asking first for the operator, and a certain number. Beyond that his conversation is a mystery, because his face reveals nothing. (Possibly speaks Arabic.)
S: INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT
N: As Louis Bernard talks on the phone, Ben goes to pick up his drink. He comes back into the room, as JO enters once again from the bedroom. She looks at Louis, then at Ben who shrugs his shoulders. Louis finishes his phone conversation, hangs up.
C: LOUIS
D: I am terribly sorry, but I cannot go to dinner with you tonight.
N: I had neglected an important matter which now requires my attention. Perhaps, another night... He bows briefly and moves towards the door. The McKenna's look at each other quite bewildered.

S: INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. FULL SHOT
N: The CAMERA is slowly MOVING around the interior of an Arab restaurant catering to European tourists. It has a Moorish atmosphere, and the diners are sitting on cushions or low sofas. Long-robed waiters are padding in and out from the kitchens, quietly and efficiently serving food. There are no Arab women to be seen. The air has a smoky quality, and the room is filled with the murmur of voices and the clink of dishes. Perhaps soft music of an oriental nature is heard in the background. The light is supplied principally from candles. As the CAMERA completes its sweep around and COMES TO REST on the entrance, we see Ben and Jo arriving. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 23.

S: INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: They are passing a couple who are seated on cushions eating. The couple look up at Ben and Jo. They are the same two people we saw come out of the Hotel Mamounia just as the McKennas entered. The woman had stared at Jo, and she does it again, nudging the man next to her with an elbow. The McKennas almost pass them, then stop. The woman continues half-looking over her shoulder again, then turns back to her dinner.

C: JO
D: Ben...

N: She sits on the far cushion. Her movements are graceful and easy as she sits tailor fashion. Ben, being tall and somewhat awkward, has trouble. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 24. First he kneels, and then with much struggle manages to fold his long legs underneath him.

C: JO
D: You're right. People are staring at us.

D: What people?
N: She gives a quiet, warning nod toward the two people sitting behind them. Ben cranes his head around, but all he can see Is the back of a woman's head. He turns back.

D: Jo, will you stop imagining things?

C: MRS. DRAYTON
D: You must think me awfully rude. I've been staring at you ever since I saw you at the hotel.
N: Jo slides a glance of "see" at Ben.

N: As the couple traverses the restaurant, our four diners watch them -- the Draytons out of idle curiosity, but the McKennas with growing astonishment as they realize that Bernard has no intention of recognizing them, or speaking to them. Jo turns back to Ben.

D: We're not an old married couple! All right -- He's a heel. I don't understand him -- and I'm beginning not to like what he's doing to our whole night.

D: As individuals we're helpless here. And because of that phone call, we can't bring the police in on it. I even thought of taking that chance.

C: BEN
D: But connect Hank's disappearance to Louis Bernard's murder. And the first thing they'd do would be to make me tell them Louis Bernard's message. That...that could be, Hank's...well, it wouldn't help him.
N: Ben goes to take some of Jo's clothes out of drawer, and comes up with a play script. He looks at it a moment, then back to Jo. Her eyes observe it, but she says nothing. Ben continues on to the suitcase, where he lays the script in with the clothes.

C: BEN
D: So we're going to London to find him.

N: Ben gets up, and the CAMERA PANS him to the dresser and the suitcases. Then he pauses and looks back at Jo who is still looking away. Jo turns back to look at Ben. She is studying him now as if she has just seen him for the first time. Her eyes are more alert. Ben turns back to his packing.

C: BEN
D: There it is -- big as life -- Ambrose Chappell.
N: He returns his eye to the book, as Jo leans closer to watch him. He begins writing down the name and address, and murmurs half-aloud as he writes --
C: BEN
D: Ambrose Chappell - Sixty-one Burdett Street. Camden Town. Telephone - Gulliver 6198.
N: He reaches for the phone, after putting the book to one side. He lifts the receiver, but Jo reaches out to stop him. He looks at her with some annoyance.
C: BEN
D: Don't you want me to call him?
C: JO
D: I can't make up my mind, Ben. I'm jut scared to death. I'm afraid we'll do the wrong thing.

N: He waits and at that moment there is a sudden, loud, but happy pounding on the door. Both Jo and Ben jump and turn toward the door, almost frightened. Muffled shouts are heard of "Open up! We know you're in there! Jo! It's us! We're here!"
C: JO
D: I go.
N: She heads for the door, and Ben sits there squirming with suspense, and annoyance at being interrupted. Beyond him, Jo opens the door, and immediately four people pour in. They are Val Parnall and his wife. Helen, intelligent, sophisticated, and full of life. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 81. The other two are Cindy Fontaine, an American music hall entertainer, now in England, around forty-five, more of a character actress than a lead -- and Jan Peterson, a musical comedy singer nearer Jo's age, smart-looking, but talkative and slightly scatterbrained. The women come in first, Helen Parnell throws her arms around Jo in affectionate greeting.
C: HELEN
D: Jo! You look wonderful!
N: Val Parnell follows the women in and closes the door behind him.
C: VAL
D: When we got your wire I couldn't believe it. What were you doing down in Morocco?

N: Jo has disengaged herself from Helen. Shakes hands with Val.
C: JO
D: Hello, Val. Jo and I want to thank all of you for the lovely flowers. But you shouldn't have. We might not be here long!

S: EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
N: In a quiet street off Camden Town we see Ben, alight and pay off a London taxi. The taxi does a U-turn and disappears around a corner. Ben starts to walk TOWARD THE CAMERA. He glances at the piece of paper from, his pocket bearing Ambrose Chappell's address. He is completely alone in a deserted street -- so much so that his footsteps click on the pavement and create the feeling of an echo. As he walks he listens to the echo ind for a moment wonders if it is an echo. He slows up and comes to a stop close to the CAMERA. There is complete silence -- only the faint distant London traffic noises. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 87.

N: A man is following him, at about the same pace. He is rather well dressed, and appears nonchalant.

N: The same man is following behind.
S: EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
N: Ben glances down at the paper in his hand, and looks up trying to locate the right house number as he walks. The street has a mixture of houses, yards, an odd dirty- looking store or two. Ben's expression indicates that he would like to make his destination before the man following catches up with him. Then he changes his mind. He deliberately slows up.
S: EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
N: Showing Ben as he walks slowly along, listening to the man approaching behind him, listening with the back of his head, and with his whole body. The man walking behind is aware of Ben. He begins staring at him. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 88. Ben instinctively clenches his right hand into a fist of preparedness. As the man closes in Ben we see that he is rather elderly, sixty years old, perhaps. As the man reaches Ben, and passes him, Ben's follows him and study him.
S: EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
N: Ben watches the man go on ahead of him at a faster pace. Suddenly the man turns a sharp right into doorway, and is gone. Ben glances at the paper in his hand. He stops and looks up in astonishment.

N: The little side doorway in which the elderly man turned. Above it is an old painted sign reading "AMBROSE CHAPPELL - TAXIDERMIST."

C: CHAPPELL SR.
D: Good afternoon, Sir. I am Ambrose Chappell.
N: Ben studies the man briefly. His face shows disbelief that such a man could be put of an assassination plot. Chappell stops in front of him, waits a brief moment.
C: CHAPPELL SR.
D: What can I do for you?
C: BEN
D: Well you see, I uh...

D: Now, father. Now why don't you go and have a nice rest?

D: Certainly. We have no secrets from our employees.

D: Okay. First of all, I haven't uttered one word of what Bernard told to before he died. And I won't. Frankly I'm not interested in political intrigue, and I don't care who it is you're going to kill here in London. All I want is that boy, and I'll get on the first plane for America.
N: When Ben begins mentioning a killing, Chappell Jr's face takes on a look of alarm, almost panic. He moves back from Ben, watching him like a deadly cobra. Ben, however, now convinced that he has the right man in front of him, moves in on him to finish his proposition.

Ben tries to shove them out of the way and get through the door. The men grapple with him. Chappell Jr., himself, and another workman rush in, endeavoring to subdue Ben. A silent, but furious struggle ensues. It is now a complete melee between the four men and Ben as they try to hold him down.
C: CHAPPELL JR.
D: Hold him...hold him...till the police come.
N: Ben breaks loose temporarily, trying to find another escape. He realizes that the time for talking is past. But as fast as he is, the men are on him again. They twist and struggle through the stuffed and mounted animals. There is a melange of lion heads, swordfish, and other partially completed jobs. Sometimes, Ben in his struggles comes face to face with the angry head of a bared-teeth lion. Ambrose Chappell Jr. himself at one point finds the swordfish a very painful object somewhere about his anatomy. Ben eventually wrenches himself free. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 95.

S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
N: A non-conformist Chapel. Empty, except for one figure, a woman laying out music on the organ rack in the front of the Chapel. The CAMERA MOVES IN on her, and as she turns on her way to the hymn board, we see that she is Mrs. Drayton. At the hymn board, she slips into it a series of hymn numbers.

N: The CAMERA THEN PANS her across the empty chapel to a side door. She goes through it.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: She comes up a flight of stairs, the CAMERA MOVING with her. She stops at a door on the first landing, takes a key out of her pocket, and unlocks the door. She enters.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: Inside of a small, almost bare room, Mrs. Drayton closes the door behind her and stands with her back to it, watching. The CAMERA PANS SLIGHTLY to reveal the rest of the room. Sitting at a small table is a listless, young Hank McKenna. He is playing checkers with the woman we saw at the airport who was standing with the autograph hunters, watching Jo McKenna. The one with the dirty glasses, who made a phone call. Hank has caught the woman in a checker trap, and with obvious satisfaction jumps three of her men.
C: HANK
D: Three men! You don't know much about checkers, do you?
C: MRS. DRAYTON
D: It's time you went to bed, dear. You'll get tired out.
C: HANK
D: Can I finish? I'm winning?
C: MRS. DRAYTON
D: Yes, you finish. Edna, see that he gets some milk and biscuits.

N: Edna studies the board with a frown. Mrs. Drayton smiles and goes out the door.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
N: In the corridor once again Mrs. Drayton locks the door, and crosses the hall. The CAMERA PANNING her. She enters another door.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
N: She enters a larger, more ornate room. The CAMERA PANS her in, and we see first Drayton, who is putting on a surplice -- and then the man who knocked on the McKennas' door in the Mamounia Hotel, looking for someone named Montgomery. He is putting on a tie and tuxedo. He wears a dangerous-looking revolver strapped underneath his armpit; Mrs. Drayton, without a word, sits down and lights a cigarette, exhaling with something close to fatigue. Then she speaks.
C: MRS. DRAYTON
D: I wish it was tomorrow.
N: Drayton turns, having finished his dressing.
C: DRAYTON
D: That's not a very orthodox sentiment.
E: Coldly
N: He goes to a desk, and takes something out of a drawer. It is a small envelope. He turns to the man with the gun.
C: DRAYTON
D: Two excellent tickets for the concert at the Albert Hall -- with my compliments.
N: He hands them to Rien. Rien takes the envelope, glances at it briefly, then puts it into his pocket.
C: DRAYTON
D: Your box is nicely placed, or shall we say strategically placed.
N: Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 103. He goes to a portable record player, which is open and has a record on it. He looks down at the phonograph.
C: DRAYTON
D: Now for the most important part.
N: He gestured towards the record.
C: RIEN
D: What is it?
C: DRAYTON
D: A record of the delightful Picco they will play tonight.
C: RIEN
D: What about it?
C: DRAYTON
D: Music is less in your line than marksmanship. If you will listen, my friend, I will play for you the exact moment at which you can shoot. Now listen carefully.
N: Drayton plays the record.
C: DRAYTON
D: Let me do it for you again. Now listen for the cymbal crash.
N: Drayton plays the record again and claps his hands together at the cymbal crash.
C: DRAYTON
D: You see at such a moment your shot will not be heard. The listeners will not even be disturbed. I think the composer would have appreciated that. No one will know.
C: RIEN
D: None except one you mean.
N: The assassin smiles.
C: DRAYTON
D: Ah, yes -- if you are clever, my friend. Any questions musical or otherwise?
C: RIEN
D: No.

D: That's a comfort -- traipsing all the way down to Marrakesh to fetch you I should like you to do me credit.
N: He looks at his watch.
C: DRAYTON
D: Your distinguished target's on the way there now. A car is waiting for you downstairs at the back entrance. You will pick up a Miss Benson on your way. She will be your companion in the box. She's there to lend an air of respectability...if that's possible.
C: RIEN
D: You will have the money when I return?
C: DRAYTON
D: I think you can trust me.
C: RIEN
D: What is your English proverb -- a wolf in Sheep's clothing?
E: Looking him up and down
N: Drayton laughs.
C: DRAYTON
D: I think you had better be going. It is impolite to be late for a concert. It would be awkward if they made you wait until the first selection is over.
N: He turns to his wife.
C: DRAYTON
D: See him downstairs, my dear. I'm sorry you must sneak out the back way, but we have to preserve our respectable front.

S: EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT
N: The Chapel as seen from their viewpoint. People are now entering it, but it seem as if the tag end of the congregation is entering, because the service is obviously under way, the sound of hymn singing coming across faintly to us.
S: EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
N: Ben takes her hand, squeezes it affectionately. Together they cross the street, the CAMERA PANNING them up the steps of the chapel and to the entrance.
S: EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
N: They enter the Chapel from the rear, looking around cautiously. A hymn is in progress. The Chapel holds about three hundred people. It is of the non-conformist type and the congregation consists mostly of middle- aged and elderly women. Although the McKennas are not aware of it, we notice that the organist is none other than Edna, the woman who observed Jo at the airport, and later took care of Hank.

S: EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
N: Carefully the McKennas find their way to a back row seat. One or two of the women in the back row turn to look at the new arrivals. Jo wants to whisper something to Ben, but with a gesture he silences her. Ben picks up hymnal, hands her one, finds the right page and begins to sing along with the hymn. But instead of following the words of the hymn, Ben makes up his own words to communicate with Jo, as he looks around at the chapel.
C: BEN
D: This looks like mother wild goose chase.
E: singing
C: JO
D: Let's wait and look around...
E: Singing them
N: Some of the parishioners turn and listen to Jo's voice because it has a professional quality that rises above the rest. Whether they are watching her in suspicion, or admiration, is hard to tell. Jo turns her attention to the hymn book, trying to be unnoticed. Ben's eyes catch something coming down the aisle.
C: BEN
D: Look who's coming down the aisle.
E: Singing
N: Jo follows his glance, leaning forward a little and to one side.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
N: Coming up the aisle with a collection basket, collecting money during the hymn is Mrs. Drayton. She is approaching the row in which the McKennas are standing.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
N: Jo looks towards Ben helplessly. Mrs. Drayton is between the two of them and any possible exit. Ben immediately eases his way along behind a column which hides him somewhat from the front, but not from the side. Jo endeavors to shrink her body behind a tall woman in front of her, but she is not entirely successful. We can see Mrs. Drayton getting closer to them. Jo looks toward Ben almost panicked. Suddenly Mrs. Drayton has reached the end of their row. She pushes forward her collection plate, and as she does so her face blanches. She instantly identifies the two. Ben, with little else to do, looks her straight in the eye and puts some coins into her plate. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 107.

N: From Mr. Drayton's viewpoint, as he notices his wife coming up the aisle with a startled expression on her face. She tries to nod with her head to indicate something important lies behind her.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
N: Mr. Drayton, trying to puzzle out her alarm, studies her face, and then lifts his eyes to look beyond her. The expression on his face leaves no doubt that he cannot understand what she's trying to convey. The hymn has come an end, and the congregation starts seating itself.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
N: The McKennas take a seat along with the rest, and as yet they are relatively inconspicuous from the front of the chapel. Ben takes a piece of paper out of his pocket, examines it, and satisfied it is the right one, hands it to his wife. The congregation falls silent as Drayton is apparently about to begin his sermon.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
N: Drayton glances down to his Bible, opens it a certain page, and as he does so, he looks at his wife who is sitting near the organ. She half-turns to look up at him. She seems frightened. Drayton fumbles with the pages of the Bible, apparently trying to make something out of his wife's attitude. Failing, he looks up and begins his sermon. He speaks into a microphone.
C: DRAYTON
D: Brothers and Sisters: The subject of my address this evening is adversity. The average life, yours and mine, is often harassed and perplexed by cruelties and disappointments beyond our control.
N: Strangely enough, it is often the things beyond our control which help to make us better beings. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 108. Pain and tribulation are the testing ground of life and let us be grateful for them. Let us bless the disappointments and the frustrations and say a prayer for the agony of the moment. Only thus shall we confirm and re-confirm our own goodness and therefore the essential goodness of all Mankind.

D: What if he asks me...

D: Tell him...tell him everything. This is the time. I'm sure Hank is around here some place.
C: JO
D: Ben, I don't want to leave you.

N: Drayton composes his face, but his eyes are serious. Without the slightest pause, he continues his sermon, shifting his ideas in mid-paragraph.

E: MORE
N: Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 109.
C: DRAYTON
D: But I believe we should pause now to do a little stock-taking -- to look into our own hearts and see what we find there. Therefore instead of continuing the service, I think we should all return to our homes for private meditation, remembering how little we have to complain of and how much to be grateful for. Next week I shall discuss the fruits of our meditation. Until then, my blessing upon each and every one of you.

N: Ben watches Drayton, with little charity in his heart. There is a stir in the congregation when Drayton tells them to go home. They look at each other, uncertainly.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT
N: Drayton closes the Bible, and begins to descend from the pulpit. The congregation comes to life. The members rise from their seats and begin filing out of the chapel. Occasionally they cast backward glances toward the pulpit, as if surprised at what they have heard.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: When Drayton reaches the two steps of the altar, he beckons the organist to him. She comes, and he whispers something to her. He then motions his wife nearer to him, and also whispers something to her. Mrs. Drayton goes off through a side door by the altar, while the organist makes her way down the aisle through the congregation to stand by the door.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: The CAMERA PANS Ben as he threads his way up through the women who are filing out. Drayton stands at the front of the chapel, waiting. Finally, after a slow and deliberate walk up the now nearly empty chapel, Ben comes face to face with Drayton. Drayton greets him with bland amiability.

D: He's upstairs. As a matter of fact you've just come in time to help my wife with Hank's food. Seems Hank doesn't care much for English cooking.
N: Drayton's eyes stray to the back of the church as he talks. Ben, noticing Drayton's eye movement, follows it cautiously. But before he can confirm his suspicions, there is a loud clang of a door closing that gives him his answer. He looks around quickly.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT
N: At the other end of the chapel, the woman, Edna, has just closed the door, and is in the process of locking the heavy iron lock with a large key. She extracts the key and puts it into her pocket.

N: Ben turns back to Drayton to find that his manner has changed somewhat. He grabs him quickly by the throat of his robes.
C: BEN
D: What do you want? I'll give you money and keep my mouth shut. All I want is my boy.
C: DRAYTON
D: And what about your wife? Did she go outside just to get some fresh air.
C: BEN
D: Tell me what you want. I'll do anything.
C: DRAYTON
D: All right -- you'll see your boy in good time.
N: With a sudden twist, he wrenches himself away from Ben. He reaches for a button on the altar, presses it. Instantly the door by the side of the altar opens and two rather strong men appear. Ben turns alertly to face them, backing of a little.
S: INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: One of the men is obviously the chauffeur type, and the other one, a handyman type in his shirtsleeves. Ben takes this in, and notices the open door behind them. Ben maneuvers himself toward the pulpit, and suddenly dashes for the steps. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 111. He surprises them with his speed, and before anyone can stop him, he is in the pulpit. He grabs the microphone previously used by Drayton in his sermon. He yells into it.

N: As the sound roars through he chapel the two man dash for the pulpit, and at that mount we hear, faintly off, the voice of Hank:

We see the usual line of posters which run along the edge of the sidewalk.
S: EXT. ALBERT HALL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
N: The screen is filled with a large poster. It announces for that evening the commemorative concert. Further details on the poster indicate that a Cantata will be sung featuring the London Symphony Orchestra, The Royal Choral Society, and a name woman as featured mezzo soprano, and Conductor Bernard Herrmann. Between the CAMERA and the Poster a taxi pulls up. It is near enough to the CAMERA so that just the driver and the door fills the screen, Jo McKenna steps out the far side and pays off the driver with a Ten Shilling Note. She hurries away. The driver endeavors to call after her as he turns the note around in his hand. He looks at it with satisfaction, and stuffs it into the inner recesses of his clothes.

N: Jo patiently awaits her turns as two or three people, perhaps a couple of Chelsea 'long-hairs', and one other people, who obviously have not reserved ahead of time because they had no money, take their turns at the window. A uniformed attendant, standing beside this queue, is repeating information for the benefit of the queue.

The constable doesn't quite know what to make of Ben's dramatic plea. He indicates that he must talk to his superior. Ben waits impatiently as the constable goes over to one of the Inspectors who is standing in a small group a little way off. From his viewpoint we see the constable addressing the Inspector with skeptical nods of his head in Ben's direction.

N: The CAMERA PANS the three across the top landing and to the doors of the 'Green Room' There are various police standing about and some of Special Branch men can be seen inside the room. 'Buchanan' steps aside too allow Jo to enter. Then he and Ben follow her in. The door closes behind them.
S: INT. GREEN ROOM - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT
N: The three of them enter the 'Green Room', generally used by the principal Artistes appearing at Royal Albert Hall. Buchanan nods to two Special Branch men who are standing about in case they are needed. The room is informal containing arm chairs, a sofa and a number of small tables. Jo sits down wearily into the nearest chair. Ben remains standing, Buchanan takes a seat in a chair near a telephone, he looks up at Ben as if he expects him to say something. Ben responds to the look.

E: Urgently
N: The door opens and another member of the Special Branch enters.
C: DETECTIVE
D: Sir?
N: Buchanan nods to him to speak.
C: DETECTIVE
D: We've questioned the woman. Said she bought a ticket that happened to place her in the same box with the man that did the shooting. Doesn't know anything -- but if she does, she's not talking.
C: BUCHANAN
D: I'll see her later.
C: DETECTIVE
D: Very good, sir.

N: A high CAMERA shows us a large hallway and ornate ballroom. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 138. As yet the room is about quarter filled and various guests of the Diplomatic Corps and others are gradually adding to the group. The CAMERA DOLLIES DOWN over them until it reaches slightly open doorway. Peering cautiously through we see the face of Drayton.
S: INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: On the other side of the doorway is Drayton and his wife. She is pacing nervously behind him. A footman comes up to them and announces:
C: FOOTMAN
D: His Excellency will see you now.
N: Drayton motions to his wife and the CAMERA PANS them after the footman across a small hallway. He is the very same footman we saw among the group of servants who were herded out of the kitchen. He opens a door in front of the Draytons -- they enter.
S: INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: Standing in front of a fireplace, above which is an oil painting of the Prime Minister, is the Ambassador whom we saw at the Albert Hall. He is on the telephone.

D: Yes...yes...I see. Well if the woman won't talk, she won't talk and that's that, I suppose. All right.
S: INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: Mrs. Drayton closes the door behind the two as Drayton advances towards the Ambassador with an easy manner, the CAMERA PANNING him.
C: DRAYTON
D: Excuse me sir, I have a lot to explain to you -- something very unusual has happened. I must also have the money to pay our French marksman.
E: Easily
C: AMBASSADOR
D: Wouldn't it be superfluous, considering that he's dead?
E: Almost casually
N: Drayton and his wife stare mutely at the Ambassador. They are staggered at this news. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 139.
C: AMBASSADOR
D: His aim wasn't quite as good as you led me to expect. The target merely received a slight flesh wound in the arm. Worse than useless.
N: Drayton still stares, petrified, at the Ambassador.
C: AMBASSADOR
D: Then your French friend panicked, and made a fatal crash -- landing on the floor of the Albert Hall.
C: DRAYTON
D: I don't see how you can hold me responsible. He was most warmly recommended by our people in Marrakesh...
E: Blustering weakly
N: The Ambassador now begins to get really nasty.
C: AMBASSADOR
D: I'm glad you're able to treat the matter so lightly. I am holding a reception here this evening. In a few minutes, I have to welcome our Prime Minister as my guest of honor -- when I hope and expected that he would be totally unable to attend. That amuses you, no doubt?
C: DRAYTON
D: I don't know what to say ...
E: Feebly
C: AMBASSADOR
D: No. But I do. You've muddled everything from the start. Kidnapping that child in Marrakesh...Don't you realize that Americans dislike having their children kidnapped?
E: Brutally
C: DRAYTON
D: How else could I make sure the American would hold his tongue?
E: Trying to keep his end up
C: AMBASSADOR
D: And then, to crown it all, you get cold feet and come running along here to hide -- and bring the child with you: Don't you see what you've done to the diplomatic status of this Embassy?
E: Ignoring this

D: How are you going to get the child out of here, eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?
E: Staccato
C: DRAYTON
D: There's no difficulty about that, surely? The car --
E: Struggling for self-confidence
C: AMBASSADOR
D: With plain-clothes detectives planted right round this building? You English intellectuals will be the death of us all.
E: Interrupting Wryly
C: DRAYTON
D: I'll think of some method. Just give me time....
E: Desperate
C: AMBASSADOR
D: Time!
E: He snorts Contemptuously
N: The Ambassador paces a moment, suppressing his rage, and then he stops and looks at Drayton as if thinking about something.
C: AMBASSADOR
D: I want the child removed from this Embassy, and removed in such a way that he won't be able to say any more where he has been tonight.
C: MRS. DRAYTON
D: Oh, no!
N: The Ambassador pauses and looks up at her in such a manner that she almost shrinks. She tries to say something, but no words come out of her half-open mouth. Drayton, however, answers the Ambassador with horrible servility.
C: DRAYTON
D: Right, I'll see to it..
N: Lucy Drayton looks at her husband with loathing. There is a polite tap on the door. The Ambassador looks up. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 141.

D: Come in.
N: The door opens and a butler enters.
C: BUTLER
D: Your Excellency, the Princess should be arriving at any moment.
N: The Ambassador braces himself, his chest swells out a little, h assumes a set smile and strides from the room. Just at this moment we hear a String Orchestra in the distance strike up some gay waltz music. The Ambassador goes out of the door. Mrs. Drayton is looking down at the floor.

N: He turns the telephone over to Buchanan.

N: Ben almost shouts as he gets up from his chair.
C: BEN
D: If the Draytons are at the Embassy, Hank has to be there too!
N: Buchanan turns his attention back to Ben.
C: BUCHANAN
D: You're probably right. But we can do nothing.
E: Grimly
C: BEN
D: Why can't you?
C: BUCHANAN
D: Every Embassy in a foreign country has extra-territorial rights.
C: BEN
D: What does that mean in common language?
C: BUCHANAN
D: As far as we're concerned, this Embassy stands on foreign soil.
C: BEN
D: Does that mean they can steal children and get away with it?
C: BUCHANAN
D: We could have the Foreign Office serve a writ on the Ambassador.
N: He breaks off and speaks apologetically as If it were I parenthesis.
C: BUCHANAN
D: ...You know, I'm not responsible for the complications of International Law...
N: He resumes:

D: ...If only we had positive proof that the boy really is in there.

N: Without answering Jo, Ben picks up the 'phone.
C: BEN
D: Grosvenor 0144.
N: Ben looks at the group briefly. Buchanan looks at Ben with keen curiosity.
C: BEN
D: I'm going to speak to the Minister himself.
N: Buchanan looks intrigued and surprised. We hear the answering click on the other end of the phone.
C: BEN
D: May I speak to the Prime Minister, please?
N: There is a pause and the distorted sound of a voice mumbling on the other end of the phone. Ben interrupts the question.
C: BEN
D: Tell him the lady who saved his life wants to speak to him. Its important.
N: The voice on the other end of the phone mumbles briefly, and there is silent. Ben has a satisfied look on his face, as he hands the receiver to Jo. She seems frightened.

C: PRIME MINISTER
D: My dear lady...This is a charming surprise...

N: They enter a large hallway. The liveried man closes the door. Standing in a nearby doorway is a group of people listening to the music of a string quartet playing in the room beyond. Included in the group is the Personal Aide of the Prime Minister. He sees Jo and Ben enter, hurries over to them, smiling and eager. The piece that the string quartet is playing ends amid a round of polite applause. There are people rising from their chairs and a general movement out into the hallway.
C: AIDE
D: Good even. Would you come this way, please? The Prime Minister is waiting for you.
N: Following the Aide, Ben and Jo squeeze through the crowded doorway.
S: INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
N: The Aide leads Ben and Jo through the main room, the CAMERA DOLLIES them. As they move through the room people begin to notice them, first of all because they are not dressed for the occasion -- but then the looks seem to be admiring ones, and there is a smattering of applause at their passage. Apparently people recognize them. The Aide takes them to the Prime Minister, who is just getting up from his seat of honor in the first row.

N: Having strummed a few notes, Jo settles down and plays the introduction to her song. We see the great tenseness on her face, interposed with Professional smiles, which she bestows on those nearest her, but always the tenseness returns. As she sings, her voice seem to be rather overpowering. It fills the whole room with quite a volume. It almost seems out of place that she has become so professional in such an intimate drawing room setting.
