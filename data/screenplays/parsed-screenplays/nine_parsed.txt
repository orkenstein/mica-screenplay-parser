S: INT. PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: The flicker of film. Footage from a press conference.
C: GUIDO
D: You kill your film several times, mostly by talking about it. A film is a dream. You kill it writing it down, you kill it with a camera; the film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it - but then it dies again, buried in film cans. Mysteriously, sometimes, in the editing room, a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when, finally, an audience sits in the dark, if you're lucky -- very lucky - and sometimes I've been lucky - the dream flickers back to life again. That's why I'm secretive.
C: REPORTER
D: So what's your favorite pasta?
E: O.S.
C: GUIDO
D: Finally, a serious question.
N: Laughter. A word: NINE
S: INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - NIGHT
N: A huge soundstage. The STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT lets a man into the stage, turns on a working light. SUPERTITLE: Cinecitta film studios, Rome, 1965
C: STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT
D: Good luck, Maestro.
N: Departing, he closes the soundstage door. As the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of light catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard. GUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the world. In front of him: AN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under construction. A complex maze of scaffolding, its unfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins. Cracked stone facades, broken columns, open platforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase. A lighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands. p. 2 Guido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts on his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the stage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping over to the crane. Guido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in every sense a jumble of ideas. Guido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the bucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands, overwhelmed. THE FIRST OF NINE LOUD CHURCH BELLS CHIMES
C: GUIDO
D: Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini... How do you begin? How do you begin this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page 1... Page nothing...
E: V.O.
N: In the distance, a figure approaches out of the darkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An escape from his tortured reality. The figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is gorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his film star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she stops in front of him, takes his hands from his face, and kisses him. And with that gesture, the music swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something beautiful, transforms into the interior world of GUIDO'S FANTASY. As Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly appear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the women from Guido's life, past and present. Women from his films, women he has loved, the sources of his inspiration and creative genius. A grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women in Guido's life are revealed, each with their own powerful entrance: LUISA, his wife CARLA, his mistress LILLI, his costume designer and accomplice GUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit STEPHANIE, a fashion journalist
C: SARAGHINA, a whore
D: p. 3
N: A dark and glamourous dream. The women surround Guido and he loses himself and his anxiety in their collective embrace.
S: INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY
N: The fantasy ends abruptly with A VIOLENT GRATING NOISE, as the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting Guido who is slumped in the crane seat. Harsh daylight penetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks, discombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures approach with purpose. One of the figures is a well- fed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtime associate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figure accompanies him, sharp and birdlike. This is FAUSTO, an accountant. Dante speaks quickly and without obvious punctuation:
C: DANTE
D: Guido! You're here.
E: walking
C: GUIDO
D: Buongiorno, Dante.
C: DANTE
D: I've been looking for you all over the place. The set's coming along. How are you?
C: GUIDO
D: Bene, grazie, bene.
N: Guido stands to greet him. They kiss on both cheeks.
C: DANTE
D: Bene. My God, you look terrible, better go to makeup, forget you've got a press conference?
C: FAUSTO
D: He has no tie.
E: discreetly, to Dante
C: DANTE
D: Yes, makeup and wardrobe.
N: He takes Guido's arm and they head towards daylight. Guido looks back at Fausto, who follows and with a look and a gesture asks Dante who is he?
C: FAUSTO
D: Signor Contini, I'm Fausto. Good morning, Signor Contini. p. 4
E: overlapping Dante
C: DANTE
D: He's counting costs, you know. The Bank wants him here. Don't speak to him, I speak to him.
E: interrupts to Fausto
C: FAUSTO
D: Okay, I have some questions for Signor Contini.
C: GUIDO
D: We all have questions for Signor Contini.
N: They head outside.
S: EXT. CINECITTA - DAY
N: Guido, Dante and Fausto hurry through the studio en route to the Production Offices. Behind them is a large poster of CLAUDIA, starring in Guido's last movie, a failure, LA DONNA MODERNA (The Modern Woman). As Guido passes he causes a mild stir, and many people nod deferentially, offer a Maestro, or Dottore. Guido nods.
C: FAUSTO
D: Yes, but please, please, I think it's customary for there to be an approved script and budget before filming commences...
C: GUIDO
D: Is he going to follow us?
C: FAUSTO
D: It's not my intention to be difficult. Maestro, I am a huge admirer of Maestro Contini's movies, your early films are...everybody loves them and... I consider it a great honour for me to be here now... none the less, I need a script and a budget.
N: Neither Dante nor Guido respond. Fausto flounders. They make their way to the Production Offices. Everywhere signs for the movie, ITALIA.
S: INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY
N: A long corridor, bustling with activity. The trio heads down it. If a pretty girl goes by, and there are several, both Guido and Dante turn to look but without missing a beat of their solemn conversation. p. 5 As they progress into and through the open plan office, many of the crew look up and cluster around, trying to get Guido's attention, swelling the procession, interjecting with their urgent requests. There are set models everywhere, in the process of being constructed, or painted. JACONELLI, Guido's production designer, looks up from a model, hurries over. Nobody stops moving. As a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to look. PIERPAOLO, Guido's young PA, has caught up with the procession. He has dozens of phone messages, sorting through them, as he walks alongside Guido, through a partitioned office -
C: PIERPAOLO
D: Where do you want your messages?
C: GUIDO
D: On my desk.
C: PIERPAOLO
D: There's no room on your desk.
N: - into the main office -
C: GUIDO
D: Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo so.
C: PIERPAOLO
D: Some of these are urgent!
E: waving them at him
C: GUIDO
D: Get me a cigarette.
E: to Pierpaolo
C: JACONELLI
D: We will never be ready to shoot in ten days.
E: confidentially
C: GUIDO
D: Jaconelli -
C: FAUSTO
D: Not ready?!
E: at the same time
C: GUIDO
D: Ascolta me. p. 6
E: continues MORE
C: GUIDO
D: Careful what you say. He's a spy from the bank.
E: CONT'D he kisses Jaconelli on the cheek
N: Guido carries on moving through the office.
C: DANTE
D: He's not exactly from the bank, Guido.
N: Now BENITO, Guido's Casting Director, moves towards Guido, Guido tries to duck away from him as they head towards Guido's office.
C: BENITO
D: Dottore, Dottore. You have actors waiting for you in your office. Auditions all morning. You should see what I've found. I found two sisters. Look, they're right...
N: Guido turns through another partition, as they all besiege him with questions. Benito despairs.
C: BENITO
D: Dottore, this way...
E: CONT'D
N: Guido heads towards Wardrobe, goes straight through the door, swinging it shut, leaving the chaos behind him. Dante blocks Benito.
C: BENITO
D: Maestro!
E: CONT'D
C: DANTE
D: Not now. He's got the Press Conference.
S: INT. WARDROBE, CINECITTA - DAY
N: Guido comes through the door, blows hard from the barrage. They're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always, for Guido. Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is Guido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky, indomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without any sentiment. She's incapable of sentiment. Guido heads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting some fabric.
C: GUIDO
D: I need a cigarette.
N: Dante comes in, closing the door behind him. p. 7
C: DANTE
D: He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli.
N: Guido sits up on Lilli's table, as Dante heads to Lilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call.
C: GUIDO
D: I need a coffee and a cigarette.
N: He lies down.
C: LILLI
D: Answer a question, I'll give you a coffee. Answer another question, I'll give you a cigarette. And so on.
E: unimpressed
C: GUIDO
D: Actually and an aspirin.
N: Dante stands at Lilli's desk and looks at some drawings.
C: DANTE
D: We're running late...
E: in the background, on the phone
C: LILLI
D: Calm down. Directing a movie is a very overrated job, we all know it. You just have to say yes or no. What else do you do? Nothing. Maestro - Should this be Red? Yes. Green? No. More extras? Yes. More lipstick? No. Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no - that's directing.
E: turns to Guido and lights a cigarette
N: Lilli hands Guido the lit cigarette.
C: GUIDO
D: That's right: that's directing. And it doesn't seem to make a blind bit of difference, finally, what the answer is...
C: LILLI
D: So please, Guido, yes or no, do you want any costumes in this film?
C: GUIDO
D: Yes. p. 8
C: LILLI
D: You see - simple! (handing him an espresso fetched by her assistant,
C: ROBERTA)
D: Might I know what period the movie's in?
N: Lilli glances at Dante who has edged closer to the table, he looks at the costumes.
C: GUIDO
D: Yes, yes. Soon.
E: downs the espresso
N: Lilli glares at Dante, ushering him away.
C: LILLI
D: You know I don't allow producers in here.
C: DANTE
D: Alright. Two minutes Guido.
N: Lilli is the only person who intimidates Dante. He leaves. Guido pulls out his own tie from his pocket. Lilli walks round and takes the tie off him. Guido sits up. Lilli puts the tie round his neck.
C: LILLI
D: He's gone. Have you written a word of the script?
C: GUIDO
D: No.
C: LILLI
D: Are you in a panic?
C: GUIDO
D: Yes.
N: She ties Guido's tie for him.
C: LILLI
D: Is Luisa going with you to the Press Conference?
C: GUIDO
D: No. Nobody. Dante. And his spy.
C: LILLI
D: You need to shave. You look terrible. p. 9
C: GUIDO
D: Why is there no fire escape in here? What if somebody needed to escape? I can't face these reporters. I have nothing to say.
E: looking around, desperate
C: LILLI
D: You'll be fine. You're a world class liar, darling, go out there and lie for Italy, lie for Italia.
S: EXT. ROME - DAY
N: Guido is driving his Roadster through the streets of Rome. An Italian pop song of the day is playing on the radio as he speeds around the Piazza del Poppolo. In front of him in the convoy is Dante with Fausto.
S: INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY
N: As Guido drives, he turns to see his MAMMA in the passenger seat. He's not remotely surprised. She appears the way he remembers her. Mamma is extraordinary.
C: GUIDO
D: What the hell's wrong with me? I can't sleep. I can't think. I can't write. I can't breathe. My heart is racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you flowers, I know. I'll come to the cemetery at the weekend. You should have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, I could visit you every week. Don't look at me like that.
C: MAMMA
D: Oh, Guido, Guido.
E: with kindly patience
N: He stops at a busy intersection.
S: EXT. STREETS OF ROME / INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY
N: This is the Rome of La Dolce Vita, the Rome of Vespas, skinny ties, cool sunglasses, impossibly cool young people. A magnificent fall day, and the cafes are stuffed with the beautiful and chic. p. 10
C: MAMMA
D: This is your Rome, Guido. The world sees Rome the way you invented it. Your films did that.
C: GUIDO
D: I miss you.
E: buoyed by her encouragement
C: MAMMA
D: I miss you, too.
N: Guido is in his own world. The policeman raps on the bonnet of the car. Guido startles and pulls off, alone in the car. Guido looks across as he drives. Mamma has gone.
S: EXT. HOTEL EXCELSIOR, VIA VENETO - DAY
N: The convoy comes to a quick stop in front of the Hotel Excelsior on the Via Veneto. As soon as Guido gets out of the car, the waiting paparazzi snap his picture. Beautiful women look at him. Guido moves quickly by them. Dante and the team hurry after him. Fausto tackles Dante. And they hurry after Guido.
S: INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY
N: A big suite. About fifty reporters, men and women, are in the room, and an array of microphones are on a coffee table next to a long couch. Excited chaos. A RADIO REPORTER narrates in the background.
C: RADIO REPORTER
D: And we're just waiting for the arrival of Contini...any moment now - Could this film put the Maestro back on top?
N: A few news cameras are filming. There's a buffet, and a bartender. And Guido comes into the room, shaking hands, patting shoulders, grabbing a glass of champagne. Dante and the team follow him in.
C: RADIO REPORTER
D: And here he is..! p. 11
E: CONT'D
C: DANTE
D: Silenzio, per favore...Thank you, thank you...
C: RADIO REPORTER
D: Dante, Guido Contini's long time producer, is about to speak...
C: DANTE
D: I want to say a few words from my heart. I am humbled and thrilled to be able to announce that I am producing Guido Contini's next film, Italia, which will star once again Contini's longtime inspiration, the international film star, Claudia Jenssen...
N: A stunning film poster is revealed -- Claudia Jenssen emerging from the Colosseum: CLAUDIA JENSSEN. UN FILM DI GUIDO CONTINI. ITALIA. Flashes. Excitement.
C: DANTE
D: ...we start shooting in ten days time in Cinecitta. That makes it one week from Monday. Thank you, Maestro, thank you very much. This is our ninth film together. Guido Contini.
E: CONT'D to Guido, handing over
C: GUIDO
D: Thanks for coming, everybody.
N: Pretending to leave, he heads towards the exit and kisses Dante on the cheek. He returns to the couch. All the reporters fire their questions at once. The questions come on top of each other, and Guido covers his despair with an inflated energy. He takes his sunglasses off and signals to DINARDO, a harsh-looking woman.
C: DINARDO
D: Maestro Contini. Maestro Contini.
C: GUIDO
D: Yes.
C: DINARDO
D: Grazie. Maestro Contini, your new film is called Italia... big title.
N: Another journalist, Leopardi, vile - sitting next to her, egging Dinardo on - almost sniggers with contempt. p. 12
C: GUIDO
D: Actually, it's my shortest title yet.
C: DINARDO
D: But hardly a modest one.
C: GUIDO
D: Films are not modest. They cost too much, they take too long, and they involve too many people. So they should have grand titles.
C: DINARDO
D: And might you tell the press what the film is about?
C: GUIDO
D: Why? I still don't know what my last film was about.
C: LEOPARDI
D: That was the problem. Nobody else did.
E: In a loud aside to Dinardo
C: GUIDO
D: Of course I can tell you what my film is about...I can tell you the story, I can tell you who I am going to cast, the music I want to use, I can tell you everything... but... I... won't. I'm afraid that if I say anything, the word might get out to the Press.
N: General laughter in the room. He wins a round, but is clearly feeling the strain... Dante recognizes, steps in.
C: DANTE
D: Our next film will be exactly as it sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a woman, Italy as a dream.
C: LEOPARDI
D: Is this true?
C: GUIDO
D: It sounds fantastic. I can't wait to see it.
N: He's still winning. Ignoring the question, he points to STEPHANIE, a gorgeous fashion reporter he recognizes from American Vogue. Flirtatious and charming, she wants him and he senses it. p. 13
C: STEPHANIE
D: Signor Contini.
C: GUIDO
D: Stephanie.
C: STEPHANIE
D: Grazie. Could you tell the fashionable women of America who your favorite designer is this year?
C: GUIDO
D: I'm less interested in the wrapping than what might be inside it.
C: REPORTER ONE
D: Signor Contini! You're a man of the world, yes? Educated in Britain, a home in Biarritz. With Italia is it fair to say that you've come home for good?
C: REPORTER TWO
D: What do you think of the New Wave in the French Cinema?
E: O.S. tries to interrupt
C: GUIDO
D: For good?
C: REPORTER FOUR
D: It's been a long time since you made a movie with your wife, do you plan on casting her in this new film?
N: Guido is spinning plates.
C: GUIDO
D: I told Luisa that when we got married I would never again make love to my leading lady.
C: REPORTER FOUR
D: But she hasn't worked at all since working with you.
N: Laughter. Everyone starts firing questions at Guido again. Another REPORTER asks a question.
C: REPORTER FIVE
D: But why are you being so tight-lipped about this film? It's a serious question. What's the big deal? p. 14
N: FANTASY:
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: We discover Guido, alone on the soundstage of his unfinished set. A retreat into surreality. He sits on the same couch from the hotel suite. He slouches, arms folded, legs crossed, with his hat pulled over his eyes.
C: GUIDO
D: I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE.
S: INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. DAY
C: GUIDO
D: You want me to be serious? In a Press Conference?
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

C: GUIDO
D: I WOULD LIKE TO BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE I KNOW THAT'S A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS.
S: INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. DAY
C: LEOPARDI
D: Signor Contini. Artists do their best work before they're famous. Now you're famous. Without wishing to be negative - but your last two films, they're not, they were...
C: GUIDO
D: Flops.
C: LEOPARDI
D: Your word. Flops. p. 15
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
C: GUIDO
D: AND IT'S A PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY WHEN MY BODY'S NEARING FIFTY AS MY MIND IS NEARING TEN.
S: INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. DAY
C: LEOPARDI
D: I'm just asking if you're nervous? You seem nervous...
N: This stops Guido. He doesn't answer. We see a bead of sweat running down the back of Guido's neck. Everyone waits.
C: GUIDO
D: Excuse me?
C: LEOPARDI
D: What I'm asking, Maestro, is have you run out of things to say?
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: As the number progresses, Guido gets up from his chair and begins to scale the enormous heights of his unfinished set, with great effort.
C: GUIDO
D: I CAN HARDLY STAY UP AND I CAN'T GET TO SLEEP, AND I DON'T WANT TO WAKE TOMORROW
C: MORNING,
D: AT THE BOTTOM OF SOME HEAP BUT WHY TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY? AFTER ALL, THERE'S NOTHING AT STAKE
C: HERE - ONLY ME
D: I WANT TO BE YOUNG. AND I WANT TO BE OLD. I WOULD LIKE TO BE WISE BEFORE MY TIME AND YET BE FOOLISH AND BRASH AND BOLD. I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN ON ITS KNEES AND SAY, "GUIDO,
C: WHATEVER YOU PLEASE,
D: IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE,
C: WE'LL ARRANGE IT."
D: THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT. p. 16
S: INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY
C: STEPHANIE
D: I was wondering if you think there's a limit to what you can show in a movie.
C: GUIDO
D: What would you like to see that I haven't already shown you?
N: She smiles, he smiles back, lighting his cigarette.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
C: GUIDO
D: I AM LUSTING FOR MORE, SHOULD I SETTLE FOR LESS? I ASK YOU, WHAT'S A GOOD THING FOR IF NOT FOR TAKING IT TO EXCESS? ONE LIMITATION I DEARLY REGRET: THERE'S ONLY ONE OF ME I'VE EVER MET.
S: INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY
N: Guido turns to the mantle. He grabs a bottle of whiskey, looks up into the large gilded mirror at his reflection. We see two Guidos.
C: GUIDO
D: I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANOTHER ME TO
E: V.O.
C: TRAVEL ALONG WITH MYSELF.
D: I WOULD EVEN LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SING A DUET WITH MYSELF.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
C: GUIDO
D: I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE TO BE THERE ,
E: SING ALONG WITH MYSELF IN A SONG WALKING DOWN A LANE NOW

C: GUIDO GUIDO GUIDO. ME ME!
D: I WANT TO BE PROUST... p. 17
E: GUIDO GUIDO ME
S: INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE/INT. EXCELSIOR HOTEL - DAY
N: Amidst the chaos, Guido notices a waiter with a tray of glasses entering the suite through a hidden door in the wall. As the waiter passes, Guido slyly opens the door and sneaks out.
C: GUIDO
D: ...OR THE MARQUIS DE SADE. I WOULD LIKE TO BE CHRIST, MOHAMMED,
E: V.O.
C: BUDDHA
D: BUT NOT HAVE TO BELIEVE IN GOD. AND YOU KNOW I MEAN IT WITH ALL OF MY
C: HEART -
D: IT'S THE END IF SOMETHING IMPORTANT DOESN'T START...
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: Guido continues climbing higher and higher.
C: GUIDO
D: ...I WANT TO BE YOUNG, BUT I HAVE TO BE OLD. WHAT I WANT IS A TALE OF SOUND AND
C: FURY
D: THAT SOME IDIOT WENT AND TOLD. I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN
C: ON ITS KNEES
D: AND SAY, "GUIDO, WHATEVER YOU PLEASE, IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S RIDICULOUS, WE'LL ARRANGE IT..."
S: INT. EXCELSIOR HOTEL - DAY
N: Guido slips through the hallway, down the grand lobby staircase, and escapes.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
C: GUIDO
D: SO ARRANGE IT!
N: As Guido reaches the pinnacle of his Everest-like set, Guido's WOMEN appear on the different levels.
C: WOMEN
D: ARRANGE IT!
C: GUIDO
D: THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT! p. 18
S: EXT. ROME - DAY
N: Guido speeds away from Rome in his Roadster.
S: EXT. ROME ROAD - DAY
N: Guido's car passes by the remnants of an ancient aqueduct, with women from his fantasy draped around him, spilling out of his car. THE WOMEN sing a musical flourish of praise to Guido.
C: WOMEN
D: CONTINI, CONTINI, CONTINI, CONTINI...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON
N: Now Guido and his women are in the countryside.
C: WOMEN
D: CONTINI, CONTINI, CONTINI, CONTINI...
E: V.O.
N: The car races over a hill, blurring the countryside, and we see the blue Mediterranean sea, and the pretty spa town of ANZIO.
S: EXT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY
C: WOMEN
D: GUIDO!
E: V.O.
N: The Alfa Spyder comes to a screeching stop in front of the gates of the entrance of an impressive looking Spa: GRAND HOTEL BELLAVISTA. The hotel has a slightly faded glamour, something that lifts it a little out of time. Guido's women are gone as the song ends. SUPERTITLE: Bellavista Spa Hotel, Anzio, Italy
S: INT. LOBBY, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY
N: Guido enters like a thief. He doesn't want to be recognised. He approaches the Front Desk, where an immaculate Desk Clerk, the urbane and wise DE ROSSI, waits to greet him.
C: GUIDO
D: I need a room.
C: DE ROSSI
D: Of course. p. 19
C: GUIDO
D: A suite.
C: DE ROSSI
D: Yes.
C: GUIDO
D: With a view of the sea. A balcony. Something with air.
C: DE ROSSI
D: All of our suites have air... let me just look for you.
C: GUIDO
D: I've come from Milano.
C: DE ROSSI
D: I understand.
C: GUIDO
D: On business. I'm a businessman. Busy busy busy.
C: DE ROSSI
D: Would Maestro Contini prefer to register under a pseudonym?
E: without looking up
C: GUIDO
D: Please.
E: doleful
C: DE ROSSI
D: Signor Milano?
E: suggesting a name
C: GUIDO
D: Why not.
C: DE ROSSI
D: Needless to say, I love your films. Guilty pleasure. Those early films.
E: continuing to work
C: GUIDO
D: Not the flops. I need to see a doctor. Do you know one who's discreet...? I'd like to see him today, in my room, now, if possible.
E: anxious, confidential
C: DE ROSSI
D: Consider it done. Please. p. 20
C: GUIDO
D: And I need to place a call. To my wife.
E: takes the key
N: Guido writes the number on a piece of paper on the desk.
C: DE ROSSI
D: You can take the call at the lobby phone over there.
S: INT. TELEPHONE KIOSK, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY
N: Guido heads into the elegant Art Deco booth, pulls the glass door shut. The phone rings. He picks up.
S: INT. CONTINI HOME, ROME / TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY
N: We intercut between the phone booth and LUISA in their apartment in Rome... Luisa knows every move of Guido's. She manages him very well, calm, dry and funny.
C: GUIDO
D: Luisa, tesoro...
C: LUISA
D: There you are.
C: GUIDO
D: Is everybody mad at me?
C: LUISA
D: Well, I'm mad at you. Where are you?
C: GUIDO
D: I had to escape from the Press Conference.
C: LUISA
D: I heard. Dramatic.
C: GUIDO
D: Don't tease me. I'm sick, Luisa.
C: LUISA
D: You're making a film. You make a film, you get sick. It's what happens.
C: GUIDO
D: No, but this time I'm really sick. I can't breathe. p. 21
C: LUISA
D: Are you by yourself?
C: GUIDO
D: Yes, of course I'm by myself.
C: LUISA
D: Then shall I come?
C: GUIDO
D: Yes, please come, that's why I'm calling, please come straight away. That would be wonderful.
C: LUISA
D: Okay.
C: GUIDO
D: Great. Marvellous.
C: LUISA
D: I don't know where you are.
C: GUIDO
D: I don't know, some spa. Horrible. I just kept driving.
C: LUISA
D: Well I can't come if I don't know where you are.
C: GUIDO
D: And, actually, it's hardly worth it. I'll be home in a day or two.
E: suddenly claustrophobic
C: LUISA
D: Yes, it's hardly worth it.
E: all too familiar 
C: GUIDO
D: But I do wish you were here.
C: LUISA
D: Get some rest, take the waters, sleep, then come back here and make a good movie.
C: GUIDO
D: I love you.
C: LUISA
D: Get better. p. 22
S: INT. LOBBY, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY
N: He hangs up, pensive. Goes straight back to De Rossi at the Front Desk, and scribbles down another number.
C: DE ROSSI
D: Your doctor is on his way.
C: GUIDO
D: This number - if a woman answers you put it through to my room, otherwise...
E: carefully
N: De Rossi understands.
C: DE ROSSI
D: It's a wrong number.
S: INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY
N: ...CLOSE-UP on Guido's eye, being held open by a DOCTOR. Guido is on the bed, shirt open. The Doctor examines Guido's eye while a heavy-set NURSE takes his blood pressure. The Doctor stands and turns to his case.
C: GUIDO
D: What?
C: NURSE
D: Dottore.
C: DOCTOR RONDI
D: Si?
N: He walks round to her. The Nurse whispers to the Doctor. They look at the blood pressure gauge. Guido is disturbed by their conspiracy.
C: GUIDO
D: What is she whispering? Is it my blood pressure? Is it serious? Am I dying?
C: DOCTOR
D: Check again.
E: to the Nurse, not answering Guido
N: The doctor, interrupting him, takes a tongue depressor from his kit. The doctor, sits on the bed beside Guido, and takes his cigarette out of his mouth. He stubs it out. p. 23
C: DOCTOR
D: Stress. Exhaustion.
E: CONT'D
N: THE PHONE RINGS. The doctor is in the way of the phone. Guido desperately makes an attempt to reach it and can't. He's trapped by the doctor and by the nurse holding his arm.
C: DOCTOR
D: Your liver, your heart, your kidneys, they're all very cross with you, Signore.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"/INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY
N: WE CUT TO A PAIR OF FULL BEAUTIFUL LIPS SINGING HIS NAME.
C: CARLA
D: GUIDO...
N: DOCTOR Open wide. Guido opens wide, gagging, as the phone continues ringing. Guido looks at the ringing phone, but the nurse has his arm in her grip as she takes his blood pressure for the second time. And the phone continues ringing.
C: DOCTOR
D: But you've come to the right place. There are a dozen mineral springs around the town...
E: CONT'D
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"/INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY
N: NOW WE CUT TO A SUGGESTIVE LOOK FROM A HEAVILY MADE UP EYE.
C: CARLA
D: GUIDO...
C: DOCTOR
D: ...the Roman emperors came here for the waters...
N: Guido lunges for the ringing phone, with the blood pressure cuff still on his arm, and picks it up. It is CARLA, at the perfect wrong time.
C: GUIDO
D: Pronto. p. 24
E: into the phone
C: DE ROSSI
D: Signor Contini, it's the Signora.
E: V.O.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"/INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY
N: WE SEE ISOLATED IMAGES OF A SEDUCTIVE BODY: A LONG LEG IN SHEER BLACK STOCKINGS, A SHAPELY ASS, MAGNIFICENT BREASTS.
C: CARLA
D: I WAS LAZING AROUND MY BEDROOM WHEN YOU CALLED AND AN IDEA OCCURRED TO ME I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING ABOUT, GUIDO...
C: GUIDO
D: It's a very an important call, Doctor. I'm sorry, I have to take it. Private call.
E: coming back quickly to life
C: DOCTOR
D: As you wish.
N: FANTASY:
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: An enormous swathe of pink satin rakes across the scaffolding of Guido's unfinished set. Emerging from the highest point is a pair of long legs sliding down the lush fabric. She wears stockings, heels and little else. Bathed in hot light, Carla reveals herself from inside the sumptuous folds of satin.
C: CARLA
D: WHO'S NOT WEARING ANY CLOTHES?
C: I'M NOT! MY DARLING,
D: WHO'S AFRAID TO KISS YOUR TOES?
C: I'M NOT!
D: YOUR MAMA DEAR IS BLOWING INTO YOUR
C: EAR,
D: SO YOU'LL GET IT LOUD AND CLEAR, I NEED YOU TO SQUEEZE ME HERE...
C: AND HERE...
D: AND HERE...
S: INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY
N: The Nurse, still taking his blood pressure and listening to his pulse, is concerned about Guido's vital signs. p. 25
C: NURSE
D: Doctor... His pulse... it's racing.
C: DOCTOR
D: Is something wrong?
E: to Guido
C: GUIDO
D: What? Yes, yes. It's about my film. It's from the Vatican. Go ahead, Monsignore! Yes, yes, of course, I'm listening.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: Carla slides from the lush fabric onto a mirrored platform. As she sings, she writhes and undulates in a seductive display of sexuality. This is Guido's ultimate fantasy.
C: CARLA COOTCHIE, COOTCHIE, COOTCHIE COO. I'VE GOT
D: A PLAN FOR WHAT I'M GONNA DO TO YOU,
C: SO HOT
D: YOU'RE GONNA STEAM, AND SCREAM, AND VIBRATE LIKE A STRING I'M PLUCKING- KISS YOUR FEVERED LITTLE BROW PINCH YOUR CHEEKS TILL YOU SAY "OW," AND I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SHOW YOU HOW, GUIDO.
S: INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY
N: Guido trying to hide the effects of this phone sex from the Doctor and Nurse.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: Carla grabs onto two satin-covered ropes, suspended from the ceiling. She wraps herself in them, swinging and gyrating.
C: CARLA
D: WHO WON'T CARE IF YOU COME TO ME TIRED
C: AND OVERWORKED? I WON'T! BAMBINO,
D: WHO KNOWS A THERAPY TO BEAT WHAT YOU
C: CAN GET FROM ME? I DON'T!
D: BUT THIS WILL HAVE TO BE ENOUGH FOR
C: NOW, GUIDO, CIAO.
D: p. 26
E: MORE
C: CARLA
D: I love you, Guido.
E: CONT'D spoken
N: Carla disappears in a cloud of hot steam that becomes the steam from an arriving train.
S: EXT. ANZIO, TRAIN STATION - DAY
N: And out of the steam... CARLA comes walking toward Guido, swinging her hips, with a PORTER behind her, pulling five bags on a wagon. Carla is dressed in her own style, which is not chic, but it's what Guido likes, a little too tight, a little flamboyant. She wears it with pride.
C: CARLA
D: Guido! Ciao!
C: GUIDO
D: Carla. Carla!
E: to himself, remembering how much work she is and now to her, covering his ambivalence
C: CARLA
D: I'm so happy to see you.
C: GUIDO
D: Carlissima.
N: She gives him a hug and a kiss, both too much for him in public.
C: CARLA
D: I missed you so much. Are you happy I'm here?
E: they move off
C: GUIDO
D: Of course.
C: CARLA
D: But very happy? Or just a little happy?
C: GUIDO
D: Very happy.
N: She sees something in his face that worries her.
C: CARLA
D: What's wrong? You look very tired, very tired. p. 27
C: GUIDO
D: Carla, all those bags for the weekend?
E: avoiding this, looks at her bags
C: CARLA
D: Yes, the Bellavista is a very fashionable place. You know I stayed there with my parents, during the war, it was full of Germans.
C: GUIDO
D: Carla... I have to tell you... they found out who I am at the hotel--
C: CARLA
D: No...
C: GUIDO
D: ... yes, horrible, but obviously we don't want to be followed by the press, so I found the most charming pensione for you, and it's right here. It's charming.
C: CARLA
D: Here at the station?
S: EXT. PENSIONE FERROVIA - DAY
N: A small pensione across the street from the station. Carla sizes it up, and it's really not at all what she was hoping for, but she doesn't say anything.
S: INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY
N: Later, Carla, in silhouette, from behind. Wrapped in a sheet, she is looking out the window of the dingy room. The light from the pensione's neon sign spills in. They whisper.
C: GUIDO
D: Close the curtains, it's too light in here.
E: O.S.
N: Carla closes the curtains. They continue to whisper.
C: GUIDO
D: Perfect. Now, go into the corridor---
E: CONT'D
C: CARLA
D: What? p. 28
C: GUIDO
D: Shhh! Yes, count to ten and come back in, and pretend you're in the wrong room, and I'm a complete stranger--
N: Carla sits on the bed facing Guido.
C: CARLA
D: I love your games!
N: She kisses him.
C: GUIDO
D: I'm here on business.
C: CARLA
D: Okay.
C: GUIDO
D: Go, go. Wait. Your face.
C: CARLA
D: What about it?
C: GUIDO
D: Get your makeup.
N: Guido switches on the light, puts on his glasses, and tilts the lamp shade up. He begins to pencil in a beauty mark and darken her eyes. He is meticulous about this, and precise, and takes his time to make it exactly as he wants it.
C: CARLA
D: I had a nightmare last night. We were in that little alley behind Piazza Navona, where I bought you that scarf, remember? The same one your wife bought you--
C: GUIDO
D: Don't move, Carla.
E: probably doesn't
C: CARLA
D: When you wear it, I never know if it's hers or mine.
C: GUIDO
D: Uh-huh.
E: not really listening
C: CARLA
D: So we were there, on the ground, naked, kissing, and we didn't care, and then my husband arrived and killed us both with a shovel! Poor Luigi! p. 29
E: MORE
C: CARLA
D: He would never do that! He's so sweet. He speaks Latin! He knows all the Roman Emperors.
E: CONT'D
C: GUIDO
D: Good for him.
E: still intent on his makeup job
C: CARLA
D: Perhaps there's a job for him in the movie--
C: GUIDO
D: Why not?
C: CARLA
D: You could work well together.
C: GUIDO
D: Beautiful. When you come in I want you to be my little savage.
C: CARLA
D: Yes.
C: GUIDO
D: Go, go.
E: gesturing towards the door
N: Guido takes off his glasses and puts them on the side table..
C: CARLA
D: You think I am one of your actresses?
C: GUIDO
D: Hurry, please, Carla.
N: Carla gets up and takes Guido's glasses with her. Guido turns out the light and settles into his pillow, for the game. Carla looks at herself in the mirror.
C: CARLA
D: Oh, Madonna!
C: GUIDO
D: I'll pretend to be asleep.
N: Carla turns back to the mirror, she puts on Guido's glasses and turns back to him.
C: CARLA
D: What if I really found the wrong room? Would you be jealous? p. 30
C: GUIDO
D: Could you do such a thing?
N: Carla teases him with a look that says, "Why not?"
C: CARLA
D: Hm! Who knows?
E: coyly
N: Carla goes into the hall and closes the door behind her. We HEAR the MATRON who runs the Pensione talking to her. While they talk, Guido removes a crucifix from the wall and puts it in the bedside drawer. Now Carla comes back into the room, giggling, signaling for Guido to keep quiet.
C: GUIDO
D: What happened?
C: CARLA
D: It was the woman from the hotel. She wanted to give me towels.
E: still giggling
C: GUIDO
D: Come here.
C: CARLA
D: Okay.
C: GUIDO
D: What?
C: CARLA
D: You are a stranger, I don't know you.
C: GUIDO
D: Carla, just come here. Be savage. Show me.
E: indicating her sheet
N: She crosses the room and climbs onto the bed and opens the sheet slowly, spreading her arms wide.
C: CARLA
D: Excuse me! I've got the wrong room.
C: GUIDO
D: Yes, you have. And I don't have the faintest idea who you are.
N: She throws herself on Guido, whose arms enfold her. p. 31
S: INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - LATER
N: Carla is asleep, her bare back a thing of post-coital beauty. Guido sits on the edge of the bed, quietly getting dressed, filled with confusion and guilt.
S: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Guido tip-toes out of Carla's room, shoes in his hand. He walks down the hallway, alone.
C: GUIDO
D: Page one, page one, page one... The figure emerges from the darkness like a goddess. She is Claudia, his muse...
E: V.O.
S: INT. HOTEL, GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY
N: IMAGES OF CLAUDIA in his fantasy. Kissing him. Walking away...
C: GUIDO
D: She takes the man's face and kisses him...
E: V.O.
N: Guido is surrounded by discarded bits of paper, an outline of Italia. An empty sheet of paper sits in his typewriter on his desk. He is not working on the outline. He is sketching a voluptuous woman...
C: GUIDO
D: ...And with that gesture, he's suddenly inspired to write something... profound.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: ...he draws in the nipples on the woman's breasts. Guido becomes discouraged. He tosses off his glasses and runs his hands through his hair in frustration.
C: GUIDO
D: Mother of God, give me a sign.
E: CONT'D
N: He's happily distracted by the sound of vehicles arriving outside his window. He opens a slat in the shutters, looks down as a motor calvacade draws up. At its heart is an impressive luxury car. p. 32
S: EXT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA, POV FROM BALCONY - DAY
N: Hotel staff swarm around the vehicles which discharge a procession of religious, including an ANCIENT CARDINAL in scarlet robes and the CARDINAL'S SECRETARY. Priests follow as the Cardinal heads inside the hotel. Guido is intrigued, hurries out of his hotel room.
S: INT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA LOBBY - DAY
N: As Guido hurries down the stairs, the Cardinal is being helped into the elevator. The CARDINAL'S SECRETARY is dealing with check-in formalities with De Rossi. Guido calls to him.
C: GUIDO
D: Excuse me, father...
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: Buongiorno.
E: turns
C: GUIDO
D: His Excellency, the Cardinal, is he -?
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: Signor Contini! I am a big fan.
E: recognising Guido starstruck
C: GUIDO
D: I would very much like to speak to the Cardinal. Do you think he might grant me -
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: Is Claudia Jenssen with you?
C: GUIDO
D: No.
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: Pity. His excellency is a big admirer of Signorina Jenssen.
C: GUIDO
D: I'm in need of some guidance, some pointers...
E: explaining
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: Do you think you could find a signed photograph of Signorina Jenssen? p. 33
C: GUIDO
D: For His Excellency?
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: Si.
C: GUIDO
D: I'm sure that would be possible...
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: Truly? What a pleasure. Arrivederci, Maestro.
N: He heads towards the elevator. Guido watches him go, then a voice calls out his name....GUIDO! Guido can't turn round. He knows that voice.
C: DANTE
D: Guidino!
N: Guido hurries towards the elevator. The elevator doors close. Guido is trapped.
C: GUIDO
D: I'm not going to ask how you found me.
C: DANTE
D: Please - it's my job. A producer needs to know where his director is at all times...even to know the pensione where his mistress is staying...
C: GUIDO
D: Oh God.
C: DANTE
D: I understand, Guido. Rome is absolutely unbearable. The pressure. It's no good.
C: GUIDO
D: Really? You understand?
N: He takes Guido by the arm and leads him to a stairwell.
S: INT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA - STAIRCASE - DAY
C: DANTE
D: Of course I understand. Absolutely.
C: GUIDO
D: You're not going to drag me back?
C: DANTE
D: No. You're a genius and genius must be served. p. 34
C: GUIDO
D: Thank you, my old friend. Where are we going?
E: Dante is guiding him
C: DANTE
D: You can't be in Rome. Okay.
E: heading towards the ballroom
S: INT. GRAND BALLROOM, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY
C: DANTE
D: Rome will come to you!
N: Dante opens the door of the Ballroom to reveal a full PRODUCTION OFFICE, ART DEPARTMENT, COSTUME DEPARTMENT, CASTING OFFICE. The models, costumes, headshots, everything all in place or being put into place. An absolute beehive of activity. Guido is staggered.
C: DANTE
D: It's a fantastic place for you to focus. Everyone is here to help the movie. Everyone is here because they love you, Guido.
E: CONT'D
N: He stands watching Guido with genuine admiration as he sets to work with his team. Guido moves through the room avoiding specific questions from everyone. As he does so, Dante makes his way over to Guido with a magnificent girl on his arm.
C: JACONELLI
D: Yes, with the flower and the glass and the arches of the Roman Empire...
E: explaining his designs
C: DANTE
D: Guido...you remember Donatella.
C: DONATELLA
D: Ciao.
C: GUIDO
D: Ciao.
E: he doesn't, she's new
C: DANTE
D: Donatella, you tested her.
C: DONATELLA
D: I was very nervous. He probably doesn't remember. I was quite nervous. p. 35
C: GUIDO
D: No, I remember you. You were, we all enjoyed you, so to speak.
E: distracted, taking it all in
C: PIERPAOLO
D: Maestro...
N: Pierpaolo, Guido's assistant, holds a telephone. Guido wants to know who it is.
C: PIERPAOLO
D: Claudia's agent...
E: CONT'D
N: Guido grimaces. Then takes the phone. He attacks the phone call with gusto.
C: GUIDO
D: Did she like the script? No no no no - impossibile - are you telling me she didn't get the script? Pierpaolo!
E: listens to a stream of invective gestures for Pierpaolo to light him a cigarette shouting at Pierpaolo
N: He takes the cigarette with a smile, and then without missing a beat starts barking at Pierpaolo.
C: GUIDO
D: Claudia didn't get the script! Send her another one. For Chrissake. Send her two!
E: CONT'D
C: PIERPAOLO
D: Yes, I'm sorry. Right now.
E: playing along
C: GUIDO
D: Cretino! Yes, yes, that's what I say, people just don't realise - she's an actress as well as a star - I know Dante's dying to talk to you. A dolpo. Ciao.
E: back to Lombardo, listens
N: He hands the phone to Dante, who's delighted to see Guido back on good directing mode.
C: DANTE
D: Lombardo... p. 36
N: As Dante takes over, Guido walks away, heads towards Lilli and her domain.
S: INT. LILLI'S TEMPORARY OFFICE, BALLROOM - DAY
C: GUIDO
D: Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!
N: Guido leaps over the balcony and lies down on a table. Performance mode off. Lilli nods to Roberta to leave. Roberta puts down her work and clears the room quietly, leaving them alone.
C: GUIDO
D: What are we doing here?
E: CONT'D
C: LILLI
D: I'm happy. I brought my swimsuit.
N: Lilli is working at a mannequin, hand-sewing some sequins on a costume. A red feathered boa is draped on the figure.
C: LILLI
D: It was Luisa's birthday yesterday.
E: CONT'D
C: GUIDO
D: What? No. Oh please God. No. I spoke with her yesterday. She didn't even mention it. Give me a cigarette.
N: Lilli points to the one in Guido's hand.
C: LILLI
D: What's that?
N: Guido sees the costume.
C: GUIDO
D: What's that?
C: LILLI
D: It's for Claudia.
C: GUIDO
D: For which scene?
C: LILLI
D: Well I don't know which scene until I`ve seen the script, but she always likes something like this, or you do.
C: GUIDO
D: Looks like the Folies Bergere. It's wrong. Italian women don't wear those things. p. 37
C: LILLI
D: Don't knock the Folies Bergere...
N: Lilli tosses the boa over her shoulder as she continues pinning the costume.
C: LILLI
D: ...it brings back happy memories. That's where I learned my art. All those sequins, all those feathers. And, you're wrong, you put Claudia in one of these for that nightclub scene in Natura Morta.
E: CONT'D Still working
C: GUIDO
D: Why did people love that film?
N: Guido picks up a straw hat. Puts it on his head playfully.
C: LILLI
D: Oh Guido, don't. That's death. Every time we have to start again.
C: GUIDO
D: I'm trying to find it.
C: LILLI
D: You won't find it with your head jammed halfway up your ass.
C: GUIDO
D: Ashtray.
N: She produces one.
C: GUIDO
D: Thanks. You were saying - my head is jammed up my ass.
E: CONT'D
C: LILLI
D: Halfway. I don't know. Why not dream up something entertaining, Guido? Something with music...with dancing... God knows, we could use a little joie de vivre around here...
N: Guido looks into the faded ballroom mirror behind her and sees... p. 38 FANTASY:
S: INT."SOUNDSTAGE"
N: ...Lilli, draped atop an upright piano, the red feathered boa hangs from her shoulders. She places the same straw hat on her head. The soundstage has been transformed into an impressionistic version of the Folies Bergere of the 1930's, with Lilli as its French Star. A spotlight finds Guido watching from the scaffolding of his unfinished set. The din of the theater audience fills the smoky atmosphere.
C: LILLI

D: A STRING, A CLARINET, A SAXOPHONE TAKE A LESSON FROM THIS OLD PARISIENNE AND THE FINEST ENTERTAINMENT SHE HAS KNOWN.
N: Behind a black scrim, ghostly images come to life. Apparitions that reveal themselves as exotic SHOWGIRLS barely covered in beads, sequins, and feathers. They descend the grand staircase.
C: LILLI FOLIES BERGERE-

D: Ah, Bon soir, bon soir, bon soir. Je suis la vedette des Folies Bergere. Vedette, it means 'star.'
E: CONT'D
N: Lilli singles out guests at the lip of the stage:
C: LILLI
D: Let me tell you. Last night I looked down at this table in the chairs you are sitting in now, and what did I see? A priest! And next to him?
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly, she sees Young Guido in the audience.
C: LILLI
D: Ahh, mon Dieu! Guido? Guido Contini? What are you doing here at the Folies Bergere? You naughty boy! You're only nine years old! But I'm glad you've come. Would you like to join me on stage? Yes. Come. Come, come, come.
E: CONT'D
N: And she brings him onto the stage. The audience applauds. She addresses him as though he is Older Guido.
C: LILLI
D: Feeling better? There's no room for hopelessness in here, is there, Guido? We must explain something to our young Guido. What do we want? Laughter! What do we want? Love! What do we want? Dreams! Let us not forget, Guido, mon cher -- That's our privilege - to entertain. p. 40
E: CONT'D to the audience

S: INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT
N: We seem to be looking at the SET ON STAGE 5. But suddenly a HUGE HEAD dips into the shot and it's Guido contemplating a model of the set. He places a figure on the top of the staircase. p. 41 He moves round to the front of the model and places another figure on the top of the scaffold tower. He knocks it over. Unconvinced, he sits down on the sofa. The coffee table is covered in head-shots. He finds the one of Claudia. Guido looks at it. He lies back to write and finds himself in CLAUDIA'S LAP. She hands him a lipstick, smiles and strokes his hair. He starts to sign - "TO HIS EXCELLENCY.... " then paints his lips and kisses the photo himself. Claudia laughs.
S: INT. ANCIENT BATHS - DAY
N: Grottos and tunnels are thick with steam. Guido follows the Cardinal's Secretary.
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: The Cardinal is right this way.
N: The Cardinal's Secretary leads Guido to a private area, where the Cardinal is already soaking in a large tub of hot water.
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: Your Eminence, Signor Contini is here.
E: CONT'D
N: The Cardinal's Secretary makes a gesture to Guido to get into the tub with the Cardinal. Guido gets in the water. The Cardinal looks hard at Guido and then makes his first pronouncement.
C: CARDINAL
D: I like Charlie Chaplin.
C: GUIDO
D: Me too.
C: CARDINAL
D: A genius. What can I do for you?
C: GUIDO
D: Do you believe in God?
N: The Cardinal's Secretary is shocked.
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: Signor Contini, please.
C: CARDINAL
D: No, no, it's an honest question. Yes,
C: I believe in God.
D: p. 42
C: GUIDO
D: So do I.
C: CARDINAL
D: Are you a Catholic?
C: GUIDO
D: Oh yes, very much so. Not as much as I would like to be, not as much as you would like me to be, I'm sure, but certainly yes, I'm trying.
C: CARDINAL
D: Try harder.
C: GUIDO
D: Yes, yes. I will, I will. Your Eminence, I am not happy. I'm searching for something. I feel a sense of misery, of despair and --
C: CARDINAL
D: I saw your films. Not the flops, the others, the good ones. But you think people need to see so much sex? It's not necessary. We can all imagine.
E: interrupting
C: GUIDO
D: Excuse me - my films are what I imagine.
E: laughing
C: CARDINAL
D: Then your imagination has no moral training.
C: GUIDO
D: How do you train the imagination?
E: nonplussed
C: CARDINAL
D: The imagination is God's garden; don't let the Devil play in it. Teach our Italian women to be wives, not whores, don't make us look at filth and debauchery. Make us proud to be Italian...
N: Guido's head disappears under the water. The sound of the Cardinal's voice trails away... p. 43 MEMORY:
S: EXT. BEACH - DAY
N: SUPERTITLE: Pesaro, Italy, 1926 Young Guido, dressed in his school uniform, runs fast across the rough dunes with five boys from the village. The boys head for a graffiti-covered defensive wall with barbed wire along the top, a leftover from the war. They reach into pockets and extract small change, hand it to Young Guido, already the ring leader. They crawl through a small opening in the wall and approach an abandoned bunker...
S: EXT. SARAGHINA'S BUNKER - DAY
N: ...Young Guido takes a step forward toward the bunker, as the other boys fearfully take a step back.
C: YOUNG GUIDO
D: Saraghina. Saraghina.
E: not loud enough louder
N: Now all the boys join in.
C: BOYS
D: Saraghina! Saraghina!
C: YOUNG GUIDO
D: Saraghina! Sa-ra-ghina!
E: loudest
N: A shadow moves inside the bunker. Now even Young Guido takes a step back, but the boys are taking three steps back. And then she comes out. SARAGHINA is a gritty, earthy woman, with a powerful, voluptuous energy. She has darkened eyes and a beauty mark: she is clearly the model for the whore makeup on Carla. She looks at the boys. She may be a crazy whore, but she's not an animal, she's just playing one for the boys, and they don't quite understand that she's having her own fun with them. She takes a deliberate step. Young Guido stands his ground. She takes another step and holds out her hand. p. 44 Young Guido opens his hand with the coins. She looks at the money. Is it enough? But she grabs his wrist, and holds it, and then takes the coins. She stuffs the money in her ample bosom and heads back to her bunker. She returns dragging an old broken chair, places it in front of the boys and sits, ready for the "show." Saraghina scoops up the soft white sand in her hands and pours it over her body... A dark vamp begins. FANTASY:
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: Curtains of falling sand fill the soundstage. Through the sand, we see Saraghina seated on the same chair from the beach. She speaks, surrounded by other WHORES in provocative positions on beaten-up chairs.
C: SARAGHINA
D: So, you little Italian devils, you want to know about love? Saraghina will tell you...and if you want to make a woman happy, you rely on what you were born with. Because it is in your blood.
S: EXT. BEACH - DAY
N: With a smile, she pulls her dress off her shoulders.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
C: SARAGHINA
E: sings
C: BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN.
D: TAKE A CHANCE, AND TRY TO
C: STEAL A FIERY KISS. BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN.
D: WHEN YOU HOLD ME, DON'T JUST HOLD ME BUT HOLD THIS!
N: She grabs her breasts. p. 45
S: EXT. BEACH - DAY
N: She undulates her body. The boys watch and cheer.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
C: SARAGHINA PLEASE BE GENTLE, SENTIMENTAL,
D: GO AHEAD AND TRY TO GIVE MY CHEEK A
C: PAT,
D: BUT BE DARING AND UNCARING. WHEN YOU PINCH ME, TRY TO PINCH ME WHERE THERE'S FAT.
S: EXT. BEACH - DAY
N: Saraghina gets up on the chair, lifts her skirt, and begins to move her hips.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
C: SARAGHINA WHORES
D: BE A SINGER, BE A LOVER BE A SINGER, BE A LOVER, PICK THE FLOWER NOW BEFORE BEFORE IT'S PAST, BE THE CHANCE IS PAST, BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN.
C: ITALIAN BE ITALIAN
D: LIVE TODAY AS IF IT MAY BECOME YOUR LAST!
S: EXT. BEACH - DAY
N: Saraghina drops to the ground and playfully writhes in the sand. The boys are transfixed. She gets up and heads towards the water. The boys follow, running.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: Saraghina and The Whores brandish tambourines. They begin a slow, rhythmic and sensual dance that builds into a wild and raucous tarantella. We furiously intercut between the musical fantasy and the memory of the boys romping on the beach with Saraghina, across the sand and through the water.
C: SARAGHINA WHORES
D: BE A SINGER, BE A LOVER, BE A SINGER, BE A LOVER, PICK THE FLOWER NOW BEFORE BEFORE IT'S PAST.
C: THE CHANCE IS PAST.
D: p. 46
C: SARAGHINA WHORES
D: BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN. LIVE TODAY AS IF IT MAY BECOME YOUR LAST!
N: The whores dance. The number ends.
S: EXT. BEACH - DAY
N: Two PRIESTS are running down the beach, cassocks flapping. The boys run. Young Guido tries to run away from the priests. They catch him and carry him away from the beach.
S: INT. ST. SEBASTIAN CHAPEL - DAY
N: Off-screen, a boys choir sings KYRIE. The priests drag Young Guido through the school's chapel, past a tortured Christ hanging above the ornate altar, into the Principal's office.
S: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Guido's mother is there with the PRINCIPAL (again, she appears the way he remembers her).
C: MAMMA
D: I am ashamed of you, Guido.
C: YOUNG GUIDO
D: But Mamma, what did I do.
C: PRINCIPAL
D: Bring him here. That savage is the devil. God will punish you for your sins, now and forever.
N: The Principal produces a cane and starts to whip the boy remorselessly. Mamma looks away. Young Guido cries out as they punish him...
S: INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY
N: ...and the cry is now in Guido's mouth, on top of Carla in the spasm of sex... He suddenly can't breathe... Carla is suddenly aware that he's not in ecstasy... He rolls over, recovers slowly. As always, immediately wanting to leave after the sex. p. 47
C: CARLA
D: What? What?
C: GUIDO
D: I can't breathe, I can't breathe.
C: CARLA
D: Guido, don't die on me! Can you imagine... poor Luigi! It would kill him.
C: GUIDO
D: If I die it would kill your husband?
E: finding her ridiculous
N: Guido shrugs the sheet off and sits up slowly. Carla kneels up and hugs him, kissing his back.
C: CARLA
D: No, that's not what I meant, Guidino. No. Where are you going?
C: GUIDO
D: I have to go to work. Carla, I can't breathe.
N: Guido stands up and picks up his shirt. He puts it on whilst they argue.
C: CARLA
D: Let me come with you.
C: GUIDO
D: It's impossible.
C: CARLA
D: Why?
C: GUIDO
D: Because it's impossible. Please.
C: CARLA
D: But why is it impossible? Look at your producer! He's married, he brings his girlfriend to work and nobody cares. Guido. Everybody knows about me. Why? Why won't you let me near you?
C: GUIDO
D: For the very same reason you don't want me to die on top of you. It's not fair to your husband. It's not fair to my wife. p. 48
C: CARLA
D: See, you're playing with me. You're twisting everything... Please let me come with you.
C: GUIDO
D: No.
N: Guido heads towards the door, still dressing.
C: CARLA
D: I'll be here waiting for you with my legs open.
N: Disgusted with himself, he leaves.
S: INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT
N: Glittering lights on the terrace. A view of the sea. A pop band and a dance floor. A slick Italian MALE SINGER performs QUANDO QUANDO QUANDO. People dance. The whole PRODUCTION TEAM is at a working dinner. Guido is at the end of the table, spilling ideas, struggling, struggling to make sense of Italia -
C: GUIDO
D: Let's say there were ten sequences, each one set in a different period, but played by the same cast, a man and a woman, a woman and a man... Something light and hectic - like Mozart would do it, like Figaro. Like the circus...
E: pours himself a glass of wine to Lilli
C: DANTE
D: Claudia is going to be amazing.
C: BENITO
D: It sounds like a masterpiece.
C: FAUSTO
D: Dante, you see, he hasn't written a word...
E: hissing at Dante
C: DANTE
D: The screenplay is first of all a map. That's a map. p. 49
E: defending his director
C: GUIDO
D: Let's try to dig for something else. Maybe a group of people digging, with shovels, in the desert.
C: LILLI
D: Guido.
N: She nudges him. He looks across the restaurant to see his wife at the entrance looking for him...
C: GUIDO
D: Luisa!
N: He jumps up from the table and hurries towards the dance floor, genuinely happy. ON THE DANCE FLOOR: - as Guido is protective of Luisa... holding her back from the dinner table.
C: GUIDO
D: I can't believe you came.
E: CONT'D
C: LUISA
D: The jungle drums said it was an emergency.
C: GUIDO
D: The jungle drums exaggerated just a tiny bit.
C: LUISA
D: Not entirely. You haven't been sleeping.
E: with concern
C: GUIDO
D: I was dying, until just now. Come.
N: He pulls her into the middle of the dance floor. They start to dance.
C: GUIDO
D: And don't think I forgot your birthday. When you get home, the house will be full of flowers...
E: CONT'D
C: LUISA
D: Am I already going home?
C: GUIDO
D: I hope not. Happy Birthday, my darling. p. 50
N: They move together, enjoying each other. She kisses him. They walk towards the table. AT THE TABLE:
C: DANTE
D: Here she is. At last. Magnificent. You know Donatella?
E: Seeing Luisa
C: LUISA
D: I do now.
N: She leans across to kiss Lilli. He sits Luisa down, goes to grab a bottle of champagne.
C: LUISA
D: Thank you for calling.
E: CONT'D to Lilli
C: LILLI
D: You're saving the movie. Give him a good idea, for God's sake.
E: confidentially
N: Luisa says hello to the rest of the gang, there are kisses, etc. as Guido returns and pops open the bottle of champagne.
C: GUIDO
D: Let's drink a toast to Luisa's birthday.
C: LUISA
D: It was Monday.
E: negating it
C: DANTE
D: Happy Birthday!
C: LUISA
D: Thank you.
E: not quite able to forgive him
C: GUIDO
D: Happy Birthday.
N: Just then, the Cardinal's Secretary appears. Heads towards the table.
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: Maestro. p. 51
C: GUIDO
D: Ah, Don Mario. Excuse me, darling, this is Don Mario. This is my wife, Luisa.
E: standing up to greet him, then turning to Luisa
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: A pleasure, Signora.
C: LUISA
D: Sit down, won't you, Don Mario?
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: Oh no.
C: LUISA
D: Please.
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: I was telling your husband how much I admire his movies. Publicly, you know the Church condemns them - we have to - but we all love them. Last year we did our own version of your Il Vicolo at the Christmas Party.
E: To Guido
C: LILLI
D: That I would pay to see.
C: GUIDO
D: Luisa was in that film.
C: LILLI
D: She was the best thing in the movie.
C: GUIDO
D: It's true. It was your first part.
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: Of course! - you're Luisa Acari! Oh my Lord!
C: LUISA
D: I was.
N: Music begins.
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: You can't stop being somebody.
C: LUISA
D: Can't you? p. 52
C: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
D: Well there's a good catholic wife for you, Guido, that's what they do - sacrifice. Still, Signora Contini, it must be a very exciting life for you...
N: Luisa looks to Guido. Close up on Guido. FANTASY:
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: The restaurant table as well as the production team are transplanted onto Guido's unfinished set. They are surrounded by camera equipment, standing lighting units, etc. Luisa rises from her chair, distancing herself from the scene. The other characters, with the exception of Guido, freeze in a dimly lit macabre tableau. Luisa contemplates her life with Guido.
C: LUISA MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES
D: TO MAKE THEM HE LIVES A KIND OF DREAM IN WHICH HIS ACTIONS AREN'T ALWAYS
C: WHAT THEY SEEM-
D: HE MAY BE ON TO SOME UNIQUE ROMANTIC

C: AND WHAT'S HIS HOME. SOME MEN SELL STOCKS SOME MEN PUNCH CLOCKS
D: SOME LEAP WHERE OTHERS FEAR TO TREAD. MY HUSBAND, AS AUTHOR AND DIRECTOR, MAKES UP STORIES IN HIS HEAD.
N: As the number progresses, the world around Luisa disappears into a black void, leaving only herself, with Guido in the shadows. Luisa climbs the staircase.
C: LUISA GUIDO CONTINI, LUISA CONTINI:
D: NUMBER ONE GENIUS AND NUMBER ONE FAN. p. 53

S: INT. INSERT STAGE - DAY
N: Luisa's screen test for Guido. A work print in scratched black and white. The music continues.
C: CLAPPER LOADER
D: Signorina Acari, per favore. Provino numero uno. Luisa Acari.
E: O.S.
N: The clapper board. TITLE: IL VICOLO (The Alley) Her name: LUISA ACARI. A small set. A couple of tables and chairs, as if it's an outdoor cafe in Piazza Navona. Luisa enters, younger, she's like Audrey Hepburn... Luisa sits on the chair.
C: GUIDO
D: Your name, it's Italian.
E: O.S.
C: LUISA
D: My father's Italian. My mother's French.
C: GUIDO
D: What have you done before?
E: O.S.
C: LUISA
D: Oh, I've waited...
E: eyes twinkling
C: GUIDO
D: Waited? For this?
E: O.S.
C: LUISA
D: Waited tables. And, of course, I studied theatre and mime in Paris. But, mostly waited tables. p. 54
E: they both laugh
N: Guido enters. He's fascinated by her. She's taken aback that he's in front of the camera and approaching her. He walks straight up to her and unties her hair. It's oddly intimate. He stands back to reappraise her.
C: GUIDO
D: Thank you.
C: LUISA
D: For what?
C: GUIDO
D: Thank you. For what I'm looking at. Keep running.
E: walking away
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: Luisa is now at the top of the staircase. She looks at Guido from a greater distance and descends the stairs.
C: LUISA
D: LONG AGO - SOMEONE ELSE AGO. HOW HE NEEDS ME SO, AND HE'LL BE THE LAST TO KNOW IT.
C: MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES.
D: TO MAKE THEM HE MAKES HIMSELF
C: OBSESSED.
D: HE WORKS FOR WEEKS ON END WITHOUT A BIT OF REST- NO OTHER WAY CAN HE ACHIEVE HIS LEVEL
C: BEST. SOME MEN READ BOOKS, SOME SHINE THEIR SHOES, SOME RETIRE EARLY,
D: SOME STAY UP TO DREAM AND MUSE. MY HUSBAND ONLY RARELY COMES TO BED - MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES INSTEAD. MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES...
S: INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: In reality, Luisa sees Carla enter the restaurant. They look at each other. Carla tries to change direction, or look as if she's come to the wrong place. ...Luisa gets up abruptly.
C: LUISA
D: Excuse me, I suddenly feel very tired.
N: She hurries away. Guido senses something terrible is happening. He gets up and goes after his wife. p. 55
S: EXT. STEPS, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT
N: Guido catches up to Luisa as she storms up the steps.
C: GUIDO
D: Luisa!
C: LUISA
D: I'm staggered by my own stupidity. I could vomit.
C: GUIDO
D: Luisa - will you please just tell me what happened?
C: LUISA
D: You open your mouth and a lie comes out.
C: GUIDO
D: What lie?
C: LUISA
D: Why am I surprised? - it's like breathing to you.
N: She walks away up the steps. Guido can only guess at what's happened. He heads back to the terrace restaurant...
S: INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Guido comes back inside. Carla is seated at a table. She sees him and calls for him.
C: CARLA
D: Guido.
N: Raging, he grabs her and frogmarches her out the door.
S: INT. LOBBY, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT
N: Guido pulls Carla through the lobby. She's humiliated.
C: CARLA
D: I was hungry. I'm tired of eating alone in that room.
E: trying to explain
C: GUIDO
D: There are plenty of restaurants. p. 56
C: CARLA
D: I wanted to see the hotel. I told you I came here with my parents when I was little. I didn't come to disturb you.
C: GUIDO
D: Well you certainly managed to.
C: CARLA
D: Why didn't you tell me Luisa was going to be here!
C: GUIDO
D: I didn't know she was here. She just turned up.
C: CARLA
D: Well, she could have warned you.
C: GUIDO
D: The only privilege my wife has these days is not having to warn me.
N: He walks over to the front desk, to the ubiquitous De Rossi.
C: GUIDO O.S
D: A taxi, please, for the Signora.
C: DE ROSSI O.S.
D: Right away.
N: Guido goes back to the suddenly vulnerable Carla.
C: GUIDO
D: Carla, you have to wait outside.
C: CARLA
D: Will you wait with me?
C: GUIDO
D: I'm in the middle of a working dinner with my colleagues.
C: CARLA
D: So why do I have to wait outside?
C: GUIDO
D: I'll find someone to escort you home.
E: shamed
N: He disappears. Carla walks towards the door, conscious of De Rossi. She's humiliated. De Rossi comes out from behind his desk, approaches her. p. 57
C: DE ROSSI
D: Signora, would you rather wait inside?
E: carefully
C: CARLA
D: I'm going to walk. Please tell my friend I had to leave.
N: She walks away.
S: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
N: Carla walks along the road in the dark, stumbling along.
S: INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT
N: Guido enters. The two single beds. Luisa is apparently asleep in hers. Guido sits on his bed. Glum.
C: GUIDO
D: Apparently she's staying in some grotesque pensione next to the station.
N: Luisa doesn't move.
C: GUIDO
D: Luisa, if I'd invited her here, she would be staying in the hotel, wouldn't she? Think about it. I didn't even know you were coming.
E: CONT'D
C: LUISA
D: Very plausible.
E: without opening her eyes
C: GUIDO
D: Because it's true.
N: Luisa turns on her bedside lamp and sits up in bed.
C: LUISA
D: You told me it was finished.
C: GUIDO
D: It is. Look, she was worried about me, she came to see if I was all right - which yes, is stupid but not, as far as I know, a crime, and hardly a mortal sin.
N: Luisa suddenly laughs, disconcertingly. p. 58
C: GUIDO
D: What? What are you laughing about?
E: CONT'D smiles, insecure
C: LUISA
D: Nothing. If you could see yourself. I couldn't live with it - the absurdity of being you, the effort of having to hide and lie and cheat. It's exhausting, no wonder you've got no script, you're too busy inventing your own life.
E: raising herself up further
C: GUIDO
D: It's finished. It's finished. If it wasn't before, it is now.
E: and he is exhausted
C: LUISA
D: Blah blah blah blah blah.
E: lying back on her bed
N: Luisa turns over, reaches to the bedside lamp and turns it off. Guido gets up and hurries from the room.
S: INT. BAR, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT
N: Guido enters the bar, goes up to the bartender.
C: GUIDO
D: Vodka.
N: A voice comes from behind him.
C: STEPHANIE
D: I'll have one of those. Due.
E: O.S.
N: Guido looks around, it's the Vogue Journalist from the Press Conference. Stephanie grins at him, infectious, full of flirt.
C: STEPHANIE
D: Hi, Guido Contini. Stephanie, from Vogue, remember me?
E: CONT'D
C: GUIDO
D: Yes, I remember very well, Stephanina from Vogue.
C: STEPHANIE
D: So, coincidence. You being here. And me being here. p. 59
C: GUIDO
D: Amazing. May I take a cigarette?
E: taking his glasses off
C: STEPHANIE
D: That was quite a performance. At the Press Conference. The Vanishing Act.
N: Guido takes a cigarette. The drinks appear. Guido produces some money.
C: STEPHANIE
D: No, please, my treat.
E: CONT'D
C: GUIDO
D: Please.
E: paying
C: STEPHANIE
D: Grazie.
C: GUIDO
D: Prego.
C: STEPHANIE
D: I've seen all your movies.
E: eyeing Guido
C: GUIDO
D: Really?
E: lights their cigarettes
C: STEPHANIE
D: Like a million times. They're the only movies that tell the truth about the modern world.
C: GUIDO
D: And what truth is that?
C: STEPHANIE
D: Death of religion... Sexual revolution...
E: thinks
C: GUIDO
D: I don't think religion is dead. And what exactly is the sexual revolution?
C: STEPHANIE
D: That we can talk about later.
N: Stephanie crosses her legs. Guido looks down and sees her grey patent leather boot moving in time to the beat.
C: A RHYTHM BEGINS.
D: p. 60
C: STEPHANIE
D: You have such style. I always think that. That's the other thing I love about your movies.

C: GUIDO
D: I hate that man.
C: STEPHANIE
D: No! Style is the new content! It's what my readers love. They want to dress like Claudia Jenssen. They want to undress like Claudia Jenssen. They want to ride on a Vespa down the Via Veneto. They want to live in an Italian movie.
N: FANTASY:

S: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Guido exits the elevator, weary and ripe with self- disgust, and walks down the hallway to Stephanie's door. Guido pushes open the door and drops her key in a bowl. He walks tentatively into the room and sits on her bed. The dressing room door is deliberately ajar. Guido catches a glimpse of Stephanie undressing in a mirror. p. 63

Champagne Popping. Flowing. Everyone is chanting Guido's name. Guido and Stephanie exit the runway, arm and arm... p. 64

D: Yes, he's in there. He's waiting for you. This way. p. 65
S: INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Guido goes in with the Matron to find her DAUGHTER pressing a cold compress onto Carla's head as she lies, feverish in the bed. DOCTOR RONDI is packing up his things.
C: CARLA
D: You came.
E: distant
C: GUIDO
D: I'm here.
E: taking her hand
N: Doctor Rondi is brisk. He nods to Guido that they go outside.
C: DOCTOR RONDI
D: Signor Contini.
N: As Guido makes to leave -
C: CARLA
D: Come back.
N: Guido reassures her with a gesture.
S: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Guido and Doctor Rondi come out. Guido is concerned. Doctor Rondi writes out a prescription as he talks.
C: DOCTOR RONDI
D: She took five or six pills, enough to make herself very sick. I understand she's your mistress. This is a sordid business. You movie people, I suppose you don't consider yourself bound by morality...
E: Guido can't answer
N: Guido doesn't fight. Rondi hands him the prescription, picks up his bag, turns and walks away, leaving Guido leaning against the wall... MEMORY:
S: EXT. BEACH - DAY
N: Young Guido, alone and dressed in his school uniform, runs fast across the rough dunes. p. 66
C: MAMMA
D: Guido? Dove corri? Where are you running to?
E: O.S.
S: INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: ... the door knob turns. Guido comes back into the room, indicates to the Matron and her daughter that they should leave.
C: GUIDO
D: Thank you. I'm going to stay with her now.
C: MATRON
D: If you need us for anything, just call, okay? Francesca, andiamo.
C: GUIDO
D: Grazie.
N: He sits on the side of the bed and puts his hand over hers.
C: GUIDO
D: Carla, I should call your husband.
E: CONT'D
C: CARLA
D: No, he'll take me home.
C: GUIDO
D: What have you done to yourself? I'm not worth dying for, Carla.
C: CARLA
D: Don't be angry with me. Everything I do, I just want you to love me.
N: This comes out with enormous tenderness, as if she suddenly understands herself.
C: CARLA
D: When you're not here with me, I'm still here. When you're in your life, making your movies, dancing with your wife - I'm still here.
E: CONT'D
N: Guido hears her. Knows what she's saying is true. She looks at him.
C: GUIDO
D: Ssshh. You should rest. We'll talk about everything in the morning...
N: He stands and pulls a sheet up over her. p. 67
C: CARLA
D: Don't leave me. Don't leave me.
E: Clutching at him
N: Guido lies down next to her, she turns to face him.
C: GUIDO
D: Rest, rest. Cara mia...
N: FANTASY:
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
C: MAMMA
D: ...Caro,caro mio.
E: O.S.
N: ...Young Guido is scaling the unfinished set, as Mamma circles him from below. Hundreds of candles fill the darkness. Mamma intercepts Young Guido as he jumps down from the spiral staircase and she swings him into her arms. She sings playfully.
C: MAMMA
D: GUARDA LA LUNA CHE BRILLA LASSU
E: CONT'D
C: HOW THE MOON GLOWS
D: AS IT SMILES OVER YOU
C: WHEN YOU'RE DREAMING BLISSFULLY!
D: DREAMING, FLYING FREE!
S: INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Guido attempts to comfort Carla.
C: CARLA
D: My husband thinks I'm clever, that's the strange thing, because I'm not, well you know that, I spend too much time in my little brain thinking about you, about where you are, what you are doing, what you dream of.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: Mamma guides Young Guido through an alle of candles.
C: MAMMA
D: OH, DREAM OF YOUR YOUTH WHEN I'M STILL BY YOUR SIDE
C: DREAM OF YOUR MANHOOD,
D: PRAY I'M THERE TO GUIDE YOU AND WHEN YOU GROW OLD p. 68
E: MORE
C: MAMMA
D: HOW MY LOVE STILL WILL SHINE
E: CONT'D
C: ALWAYS REMEMBER MY SON... YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MINE!
D: YES, MINE!
N: She gently spins Young Guido, and - as he completes the turn - he is replaced by Older Guido. Mamma now waltzes with her adult son.
C: MAMMA GUIDO
D: SAI CHE TI VOGLIO BENE,
E: CONT'D
C: FIGLIOLO MIO, GUIDO
D: DO YOU THINK THAT SO MANY
C: WILL LOVE YOU
D: AS I DO?
N: Mamma caresses Guido's face. Guido pulls away. Older Guido watches, as Mamma takes Young Guido up the grand staircase.
C: MAMMA GUARDA LA LUNA,
D: SHE HANGS IN THE SKY
E: CONT'D
C: BEAMING HER BLESSING
D: TO MAKE YOU AND I KNOW THAT
C: THIS ONE GOODNIGHT KISS
D: WILL KEEP ALL YOUR LIFE PERFECT LIKE THIS.
N: Mamma sits on the steps with Young Guido. He rests his head in her lap. Older Guido walks past them up the staircase.
C: GUIDO
D: Hold on to me, Mamma. Don't let me wake from this.
N: He disappears into darkness.
S: INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY
N: Guido wakes. It's morning. Carla looks very fragile as the first rays of sun touch the room. Him, too. He rubs his face, hears voices. He gets up, goes out to investigate.
S: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY
N: Carla's husband, LUIGI, is talking with Matron on the landing. p. 69 Guido straightens himself up, approaches, as Matron retreats to leave them alone. LUIGI is a nice, dignified man. He's very anxious. He and Guido can't really look at each other.
C: MATRON
D: Excuse me.
N: She leaves.
C: LUIGI
D: Is she okay?
C: GUIDO
D: Yes.
C: LUIGI
D: I'd like to take her home.
C: GUIDO
D: Of course. I'm sorry. She loves you, you know that, don't you.
E: hapless
C: LUIGI
D: She's my wife.
N: He walks into the room. Guido stands outside for a second, then turns to go.
S: INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY
N: The door is open as Guido enters. He's confused, worried that Luisa has gone, perhaps. But then he sees a figure moving about in the dressing room, emptying a closet.
C: GUIDO
D: Darling?
N: Dante appears, stuffing Guido's things into a suitcase.
C: DANTE
D: We're going back to Rome.
C: GUIDO
D: Where's Luisa?
E: anxious
C: DANTE
D: Luisa? She's gone. She's had it with you. And quite frankly, so have I. You drag a whole crew up here and then you just disappear. p. 70
E: different tone MORE
C: DANTE
D: I can't protect you anymore. And Claudia is in Rome. Makeup tests start today. Remember?
E: CONT'D
C: GUIDO
D: I can't.
E: sits
C: DANTE
D: You can't. You must. Don't sit down.
C: GUIDO
D: I need help.
C: DANTE
D: You've had help. You've seen the doctors, you've seen the priests, you've taken the cure.
E: still packing
C: GUIDO
D: I'm not cured.
C: DANTE
D: That's enough! The movie calls, your star has landed. Fausto - take his things please.
E: decisive, no arguments
N: Dante walks over to the door with the suitcase, passing Fausto. A Bellboy and a luggage cart stand in the hall.
C: DANTE
D: Guido! Andiamo!
E: CONT'D impatient, at the door
S: EXT. GATES OF CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Guido's Roadster approaches the gates. There are PAPARAZZI gathered for the arrival of Claudia, for the beginning of filming. They drive through, solemn faced, ignoring the press.
C: GUIDO
D: I need more time.
E: O.S.
C: DANTE
D: Forget the script. Claudia's here now. She'll inspire you to do what you do best, write with your camera. p. 71
E: O.S.
S: EXT. CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The whole energy of this return to Cinecitta is hectic, people wanting to work, equipment waiting to work, everybody and everything needing Guido's attention. Guido drives towards the stages. Guido feels the pressure that the whole studio is gearing up for a movie that doesn't exist. Guido is trying not to panic. He feels as if he's just arrived in prison camp. He drives fast and straight to Stage 4, and as they head towards the studio, they are immediately swamped. Pierpaolo has a hundred requests for Guido...
C: PIERPAOLO
D: Maestro, the screen tests are back from the lab. Will you watch them now?
C: DANTE
D: Tonight. We'll watch everything tonight and make some decisions.
C: PIERPAOLO
D: Design meeting? Production meeting?
C: DANTE
D: Tonight.
C: PIERPAOLO
D: Tonight.
N: Dante marches Guido towards the stage. Lilli joins them.
C: LILLI
D: Claudia says where are you? She's in fine form. Feisty.
C: GUIDO
D: Okay.
E: knows what that means
C: LILLI
D: She asked if she could read my script as she didn't have one. I said I didn't quite have mine.
N: Lilli peels off and joins her assistant Roberta at a rack of costumes. p. 72
S: INT. INSERT STAGE, CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON
N: A couple of huge cameras are being prepared, some lights are being flown up into the grid, the LOADER is preparing the Clapper Board. The Loader has created a slate: ITALIA, CLAUDIA JENSSEN, HAIR AND MAKEUP TESTS. The gang enters. Guido says a brisk hello to the crew, then leaves the set quickly. Finds the studio telephone behind the flats. He dials. Guido waits. Luisa picks up the phone.
C: LUISA
D: Pronto.
C: GUIDO
D: Luisa, it's me. Please don't hang up. I want you to be with me in the screening room tonight. I want to talk to you about the casting, about the script. Everything...
E: she doesn't respond
S: INT. INSERT STAGE/CONTINI HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
N: INTERCUT, LUISA at home, listening, inscrutable.
C: GUIDO
D: Otherwise I won't be able to start, I won't know what I'm thinking...
N: Luisa listens. Pierpaolo appears again, always the same, needs him to start.
C: PIERPAOLO
D: Maestro.
N: Guido nods, waves him away.
C: GUIDO
D: Are you there? Luisa?
C: LUISA
D: Go on.
C: GUIDO
D: I'm not asking you to let me come home, I just want you to come to the screen test tonight. Not for me, but for the movie. You always have, you always do.
N: Luisa puts down the phone. p. 73 Guido is in a mess.
S: INT. INSERT STAGE - EARLY EVENING
N: Guido walks forward and sits by the camera, as suddenly there's a commotion at the studio door, and Lilli and some of her assistants come through, silhouettes only, followed by a tall figure, who demands the space around her. As the others walk towards a holding area with costumes, and wigs and all manner of items, the woman, who is CLAUDIA, of course, simply walks into the light, her home, and stands there waiting for Guido. She looks stunning and glamorous. The epitome of a Sixties movie star. Guido gets up and approaches Claudia. Pierpaolo acts as First Assistant Director.
C: PIERPAOLO
D: Silence please. Se gira. And we are rolling.
N: Guido gets behind the camera and films Claudia's test.
C: GUIDO
D: Could you turn to the right please, Claudia.
C: CLAUDIA
D: Yes, I can turn to my right.
C: GUIDO
D: And can you turn to the left.
C: CLAUDIA
D: Yes, I can turn to my left.
C: GUIDO
D: Now just one slow turn for us.
C: CLAUDIA
D: Okay, one slow turn.
E: she turns around
C: GUIDO
D: Bellissima. Brava. Cut.
C: PIERPAOLO
D: We've got it. Next costume please.
N: Makeup artists and costume assistants immediately surround her, loosening her hair. Dante is thrilled. Fausto is also mesmerised. She's a star, that's the long and short of it. p. 74 And she's warming up for a fight with her director. Another litany of jibes, half-joking, but dangerous.
C: CLAUDIA
D: Has anybody got a script? Script missing, handsome reward.... Lost, one script, title Italia. Can't make a film without it...
N: Lilli comes forward, puts a chinchilla fur coat on Claudia, adjusts her hair.
C: CLAUDIA
D: So interesting to do hair and makeup for a part when you don't know what the part is.
E: CONT'D
N: Guido adores her, her spirit, her feistiness.
C: CLAUDIA
D: No! I'm going back to my hotel now.
E: CONT'D shrugs off the coat
C: PIERPAOLO
D: But please, just a couple more costumes, Claudia.
E: anxious
C: CLAUDIA
D: I'm going back to my hotel now, my darling, and when I there is a script, I'll read it and then we'll take it from there. I love the costumes, Lilli. They are beautiful. Ciao Bello.
E: to Guido calls over to Lilli back to the guys, sweetly
C: GUIDO
D: That's fair.
C: DANTE
D: Claudia!
C: GUIDO
D: That's fair.
E: to Dante
C: DANTE
D: Fair?
C: GUIDO
D: I'll be back. p. 75
N: Guido races after Claudia, taking the chinchilla coat from Lilli with him. Opportunity for escape.
C: DANTE
D: You've got dailies, Guido.
E: calling to Guido
C: GUIDO
D: I'll be right back.
C: DANTE
D: You've got meetings.
E: shouting
S: EXT. CINECITTA - NIGHT
N: Guido drives Claudia towards the gates, which swing open. The paparazzi are in waiting and swarm the car, flashbulbs popping, men clambering onto the car for a picture of the Star driving away with her Director. Lots of shouting and pleas, lots of remonstration from Guido. They drive away, and are immediately followed by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and Vespas and little cars.
S: INT. CAR, ROME OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT
N: Guido's Roadster roars away, the papparazzi posse following. Guido glances at Claudia, loves having her in the car, she's such a class act. He's always inspired. He's driving fast but distracted by her.
C: GUIDO
D: You look ravishing.
C: CLAUDIA
D: You're not seeing me, you're seeing Lilli's wigs and makeup, I'm somewhere hidden underneath.
N: Guido's a good driver and weaves in and out of the traffic. So do the posse, but as the road opens up, they can't keep up with him and he manages to overtake a car, they speed after him.
S: EXT. MEDIEVAL LANES, TRASTEVERE - NIGHT
N: Guido stops the car by some narrow streets in the Trastevere, just south of the Vatican. They watch the photographers hurtle past in search of them. They sit for a second. p. 76
C: GUIDO
D: It's good to see you.
C: CLAUDIA
D: I'm assuming that's code for there's no script.
N: Guido is exasperated.
C: GUIDO
D: Why is everybody so suddenly obsessed with the script?
N: Claudia listens. She's always seduced by the way he speaks, his passion. They fall in love with each other in every movie, that's the way of it. Guido lights a cigarette.
C: GUIDO
D: Talk to the people who love you in our films, they're not interested in my script! They're interested in the way you turn your head, the way the camera looks past you to the moon... the way you smile a little as you cry, the way you really do blush for the camera - how?! - who even knows, but whatever else it is, it's not my script.
E: CONT'D enough examples, sighs
N: Guido has no confidence in what he's saying anymore. They get out of the car and begin to walk away. It's almost deserted here.
C: CLAUDIA
D: So Lilli says I'm playing a million different parts -
C: GUIDO
D: Not a million - you're the muses, the incredible women who made Italy what it is today, a country run by men - who are themselves run by women, whether they know it or not.
C: CLAUDIA
D: So I'm the women behind the great men?
E: teasing him
C: GUIDO
D: The great women... p. 77
E: trying hard to tell the truth MORE
C: GUIDO
D: In a way - yes - you have this man in the story and he's, he wants to take hold of everything, to devour everything, he can't let anything go, or, he doesn't want to, and he changes direction every day, because he's lost, he's dying, he's bleeding to death...
E: CONT'D
C: CLAUDIA
D: And these muses - they fall in love with the man?
E: deflating
C: GUIDO
D: Exactly! They fall in love with him.
C: CLAUDIA
D: I'd rather be the man.
E: decisive
C: GUIDO
D: What?
C: CLAUDIA
D: I'd rather be the man.
N: She grabs his hat, puts it on her head. Saunters down the road. He follows. FANTASY:
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
C: CLAUDIA
D: IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, ONE TIME I NEEDED YOU, IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY,
C: YOU WERE MY FRIEND.
D: MAYBE IT LASTED A DAY, MAYBE IT LASTED AN HOUR, BUT SOMEHOW IT WILL NEVER END.
S: EXT. MEDIEVAL LANES, TRASTEVERE - NIGHT
C: CLAUDIA
D: These women who come off their pedestals for a kiss - they're just fantasies.
C: GUIDO
D: No, you misunderstand... p. 78
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
C: CLAUDIA
D: IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU, IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY,
C: I WANT TO CRY.
D: SOMETHING INSIDE ME GOES WEAK,
C: SOMETHING INSIDE ME SURRENDERS,
D: AND YOU'RE THE REASON WHY,
C: YOU'RE THE REASON WHY.
D: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO TO ME. YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE. YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME
C: LOOKING AT YOU.
D: IT SCARES ME SO THAT I CAN HARDLY SPEAK.
S: EXT. MEDIEVAL LANES, TRASTEVERE - NIGHT
C: GUIDO
D: She's his inspiration.
C: CLAUDIA
D: I can't keep playing that part.
C: GUIDO
D: I fall in love with you every time.
C: CLAUDIA
D: When there's a camera between us.
C: GUIDO
D: No.
C: CLAUDIA
D: It's not a real person, Guido. And this man you describe - he doesn't know how to love.
E: pointed
C: CLAUDIA
D: IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, I OWE WHAT I AM TO YOU.
E: O.S. CONT'D
S: EXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT
N: Claudia heads towards a little Piazza with an ancient fountain in the centre of the square. The Piazza is empty except for a few cars parked where the entrances have been blocked off. Claudia steps up onto the fountain. p. 79
C: GUIDO
D: There was a time once, we were on location, some terrible hotel - and you were in the room directly above me and I could hear you walking about...
N: Guido sits down at the edge of the fountain.
C: GUIDO
D: ...and, all through the night, I wanted to rush up the stairs and hammer on your door until you opened.
E: CONT'D
C: CLAUDIA
D: And why didn't you?
C: GUIDO
D: I don't know. I don't know.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
C: CLAUDIA
D: SPECIAL TO ME IN MY LIFE, SINCE THE FIRST DAY THAT I MET YOU. HOW COULD I EVER FORGET YOU, ONCE YOU HAD TOUCHED MY SOUL. IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, YOU'VE MADE ME WHOLE.
S: EXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT
N: Claudia leaves behind the hat on the fountain and moves closer to Guido. The music continues.
C: CLAUDIA
D: Maybe you should have knocked, maybe you should have knocked me right off the pedestal. I can't do this anymore.
N: She takes off her wig and diamond earrings.
C: CLAUDIA
D: This is me. And you have a wife who loves you.
E: CONT'D
N: She hands him the wig and the earrings. She kisses him.
C: CLAUDIA
D: I'll miss you. Wrong girl.
E: CONT'D
N: The music ends. Claudia turns and walks away. p. 80
S: INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT
N: A screen, the leader of a film reel, numbers counting down, the synch pop on 3, and Claudia appears on the screen, looking extraordinary from the hair and makeup test. People start to comment, all enthusiastically. Guido gets a cigarette off Pierpaolo and lights up.
C: DANTE
D: Great work, Lilli... Wonderful costume...
E: to Lilli
C: LILLI
D: Thank you.
C: DANTE
D: ...and the hair, makeup, fantastic.
N: Guido watches, sitting alone, he turns around as he sees someone come in the door, but it's Gianluca, not Luisa.
C: BENITO
D: She has a beautiful profile.
C: DANTE
D: Two great profiles.
C: FAUSTO
D: She's a goddess.
C: DANTE
D: And the back isn't too bad.
C: FAUSTO
D: She came directly from Venus. Beautiful.
C: DANTE
D: Fantastic. Guido? Really nice. Who's next?
C: BENITO
D: Actresses.
C: DANTE
D: Okay. Let's see the actresses.
N: The reel finishes. The lights come up, to excited chatter, he looks at Lilli a row or two behind him, she shrugs sympathetically. The room goes dark, the next reel begins. Guido turns back to look at the screen. p. 81 During the reel, Dante is very decisive... shouts out, as the women appear. They come on, one after the other, say their names. Guido gives them things to do. Pick up the phone and argue with your lover. No, make him laugh. Make him want you. Walk towards the camera as if you were frightened. As if you were angry. ON ELEANORA - very angry on the phone:
C: BENITO
D: If we like her, we have to call her agent right away. Everybody wants her right now.
C: DANTE
D: Well they can keep her.
C: BENITO
D: She's a very funny actress.
C: DANTE
D: She's peculiar. You don't like her Guido?
N: Next actress: ILARIA. Someone comes in the door. Guido turns and sees it's Luisa, sitting next to Lilli. She's come. He turns back to the screen. Another actress appears. It's Donatella. Very nervous. She says her name. Guido instructs her. She tries the phone, the walks. She's not a natural. Luisa finds the gentle humor in this situation. She looks at Guido. A little smile. He feels it like sunshine. He turns back to the screen.
C: DANTE
D: She's nice.
E: CONT'D
C: FAUSTO
D: She's very natural.
C: DANTE
D: Even better. She's a bit nervous here. What do you say, Guido? Donatella's nice?
N: Another girl: ALESSIA. Very striking. Keeps looking out past the camera, getting sotto voce instructions from Guido. Her hair is in a chignon. She begins her improv, but Guido interrupts her, suddenly appears in front of the camera. Approaches her, and undoes the chignon, freeing her hair. She's beautiful and innocent. Guido says something to her, a whisper. But what he says and how he says it, the smile it provokes, goes like a dagger to Luisa. p. 82
C: DANTE
D: Who's this? I thought we were looking for a blonde.
E: CONT'D
C: FAUSTO
D: She's too tall.
C: DANTE
D: Very tall.
C: BENITO
D: She's very beautiful.
C: DANTE
D: It's not the point. Guido wants the blonde.
C: FAUSTO
D: She's not bad, but -
C: DANTE
D: Shh.
C: FAUSTO
D: She's beautiful.
C: DANTE
D: She's too beautiful. For my tastes.
N: As the reel finishes... and the lights come up.
C: DANTE
D: I don't know what Guido thinks. I think we are happy with Donatella. Donatella's better, isn't she?
E: CONT'D
C: GUIDO
D: Sure.
C: DANTE
D: Great. Anyway, fantastic day, but we have to go home. We have a very, very busy day tomorrow. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Okay, well done.
E: delighted, jumps up
N: The screening room empties, a lot of mutual congratulations on good work, especially to Lilli, and a hug or a handshake from almost everybody for Luisa. Lilli kisses her, leaves. Just the two of them now, husband and wife, several rows apart in the empty screening room.
C: GUIDO
D: It meant so much to us all. That you came. p. 83
E: MORE
C: GUIDO
D: What did you think? Did you like anybody or -? Luisa?
E: CONT'D nothing from Luisa nothing
N: FANTASY:
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: THE BEAT OF A STRIPPER'S DRUM. A gloved hand emerges from behind a beaded curtain, beckoning. The curtain opens, revealing the silhouette of a figure bathed in red light. Guido sits in an audience of raucous men who have filled all the seats around him. They start to whistle as if they were at some sleazy club. Guido squirms, trapped. The figure steps forward. It's Luisa, tricked out like a seedy nightclub stripper.
C: LUISA YOU WANT MY LOVE? TAKE IT ALL
D: YOU WANT TO WATCH IT ALL COME OFF?
C: TAKE IT ALL COME ON NOW SHOW ME HOW
D: YOU TAKE IT ALL...
S: INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT
C: LUISA
D: Thank you.
C: GUIDO
D: What for?
E: encouraged
C: LUISA
D: Thank you for reminding me I'm not special. You don't even see what you do, do you? Even the moments I think are ours, it's just you working to get what you want.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: Luisa strips. p. 84
C: LUISA YOU WANT MY GLOVE? ARE YOU ENTHRALLED?
D: YOU WANT TO SEE IT SLIP AWAY
C: AND WATCH IT FALL? OH WE KNOW IT'S YOUR SHOW
D: SO TAKE IT ALL
S: INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT
C: GUIDO
D: What are you talking about?
E: dawning on him
N: He stands up, leans on the chair back.
C: GUIDO
D: The screen test? You have to understand, it's nothing, this is what I do, I direct. That's my job.
E: CONT'D
N: Guido stands up straight.
C: LUISA
D: And this is our life. You think to create is to forgive yourself in public. Fine. But don't think I can forgive you in private, because I can't ever.
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: As the strip becomes more raw, Luisa defiantly exposes her body and her contempt for Guido. Guido watches, humiliated.
C: LUISA SO GO AHEAD
D: TAKE IT ALL
C: YOU WANT MY SOUL?
D: TAKE IT ALL!
C: IT'S TIME TO LEAVE. IF I'M TO LIVE.
D: BECAUSE I HAVE NO MORE, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO GIVE...
N: Instrumental. Luisa charges into the audience: she is mauled and assaulted by the men. p. 85
C: LUISA I WATCH YOU RISE! I WATCH YOU FALL! WHILE I AM STANDING
D: WITH MY BACK AGAINST THE WALL
E: CONT'D
C: NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
D: TO FINALLY LEARN
C: YOU HAD THE WORLD YOU HAD YOUR FLING
D: YOU WANTED MORE THAN EVERYTHING
C: YOU GOT YOUR WISH YOU GOT YOUR PRIZE

C: BUT DON'T YOU SEE THAT IN THE END THERE WILL BE
D: NOTHING!
S: INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT
C: LUISA
D: You're just an appetite, and if you stopped being greedy you'd die. You take everything, and I'm empty.
N: Luisa gets up from her chair, heads to the exit door.
C: LUISA
D: You know, I'm glad I came. I can see now... it's hopeless...
E: CONT'D
N: Luisa leaves. Guido is left alone. The room goes dark as the screen tests, on a loop, start up again. Guido walks into the flickering light of the projector...
C: GUIDO
D: What have I done? What have I done, Luisa?
S: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
N: ...He sits silhouetted by the harsh white beams.
C: GUIDO
D: I CAN'T MAKE THIS MOVIE, THERE'S NO WAY THAT I'LL BEGIN IT. I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE THE CAMERAS ROLL.
C: PROBLEM IS THE SUBJECT,
D: THERE'S NO PLEASANT WAY TO TREAT IT. p. 86
E: MORE
C: GUIDO
D: THE PROBLEM IS THE AUTHOR'S LOST
E: CONT'D

C: SIDESHOW.
D: TELL THE CAST AND CREW THAT THEY CAN ALL GO.
N: Guido stands and walks towards the image on the screen. He violently rips the screen to the ground.
C: GUIDO FIND ANOTHER GENIUS,
D: I CAN'T BE ONE OR BECOME ONE. I CAN'T EVEN TELL HOW I'D BEGIN. HELP LUISA, HELP ME, HELP ME MAMMA,
E: CONT'D
C: HELP ME SOMEONE.
D: HERE'S A PLACE WHERE I HAVE NEVER
C: BEEN. GUIDO OUT IN SPACE WITH NO DIRECTION,
D: GUIDO AT A LOSS FOR WHAT TO SAY, GUIDO WITH NO INTERVENING ACTORS, GUIDO AT THE MERCY OF DETRACTORS, GUIDO HERE, WITH NO ONE ELSE BUT...
C: NOTHING HOLDS TOGETHER
D: NOTHING MAKES A BIT OF SENSE NOW IMPOSSIBLE TO GRASP OR UNDERSTAND HOW CAN I GO ON TO WATCH THE WHOLE OF
C: MY EXISTENCE
D: END UP BEING NOTHING THAT I PLANNED HAVE I LOST MYSELF AND ALL I WISHED
C: FOR
D: HAS MY LIFE BECOME A MINDLESS GAME GUIDO, I CAN'T STAND THE NAME OF GUIDO
C: GUIDO, FOR GODSAKE, WHO IS THIS GUIDO?
D: GUIDO HERE, WITH NO ONE ELSE BUT GUIDO...
N: Guido collapses to his knees.
C: GUIDO
D: I destroyed everything, Mamma...
E: CONT'D honest
N: Suddenly, his mother appears.
C: GUIDO
D: ...I destroyed everything, I just... you make one wrong turn and then because of that, after it all the turns are wrong. And you are so far from where you wanted to be...and you're lost and then you're lost. p. 87
E: CONT'D
C: MAMMA
D: No one can help you find your way. It's up to you, Guido. Up to you. Nobody else.
E: a beat
N: In Guido's face, a soulful recognition that what she's said is true.
S: INT. CINECITTA, STAGE 5 - DAY
N: A HUGE CRASH... ...A large piece of Guido's set comes crashing down. Dante and Guido walk through the empty soundstage, leaving behind the set which is being dismantled by a group of construction workers.
C: GUIDO
D: Old friends, I have to come clean with you.
E: O.S.
S: INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY
N: REALITY. Guido faces his production team. This is hard for him.
C: GUIDO
D: There is no movie. I can't pretend anymore. We have to stop. I'm sorry.
E: nothing more to say
N: There is silence in the room.
S: EXT. CINECITTA, STAGE 5 - DAY
N: The metal soundstage door opens as Guido and Dante walk through and into the sunlight. Guido is defeated. He stops at his car and turns to Dante. Guido gets in his car. Guido drives away. Dante watches him go.
S: EXT. BEACH - ANGUILLARA - AFTERNOON
N: A cold wind blows. A lonely figure (GUIDO) walks along a deserted beach. SUPERTITLE: Anguillara, Italy, 2 years later p. 88
S: EXT. BEACH CAFE, ANGUILLARA - AFTERNOON
N: It's the end of the season. Only a few customers left in the cafe, as the waiters close up for the day, pulling down umbrellas, stacking tables. Guido's changed, bearded, hair longer and unkempt. Haggard. He looks out to sea, alone, as the waves crash to and fro. A newspaper sits open in front of him. Scribbles and heavy markings circle an ad for a theater production in Rome. Guido gets up at this moment, starts to leave, hesitates, takes the paper, folds it under his arm, and exits the restaurant. He heads up the steps towards the promenade and we catch a glimpse of the profound regret in his eyes -
S: EXT. ROME, THEATER - NIGHT
N: Guido waits, nervous, in a doorway across the street from a theatre that's presenting the Pirandello play, DIANA E LA TUDA, starring LUISA ACARI. Luisa exits the theatre with the company of actors, all of them plaited together in post-performance bonhomie. Guido watches from a distance. Luisa takes the arm of a handsome male, as they cross and head down the street.
S: EXT. ANGUILLARA STREETS - DAY
N: Guido and Lilli walk along the waterfront. People pass by occasionally. They talk -
C: LILLI
D: I'm glad she's acting again. I made her costumes for the play. She's funny.
C: GUIDO
D: She seemed so happy. I didn't want to interfere... Is she with anybody?
C: LILLI
D: Guido, she's my friend. I'm not her mother. I don't know. I expect so. Nobody likes to be alone. Promise me you're going to let me cut your hair and get rid of that awful beard. p. 89
C: GUIDO
D: I like to get about without everybody pointing at me.
C: LILLI
D: And where are you getting about?
C: GUIDO
D: Nowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be able to walk.
C: LILLI
D: Are you seeing anybody?
C: GUIDO
D: No, no. Nobody.
C: LILLI
D: Well, it sounds exciting. Walking around and not seeing anyone, growing a beard. I might come up here and join you.
E: teasing
C: GUIDO
D: Don't tease me, Lilli. My heart is -
C: LILLI
D: - I know.
C: GUIDO
D: I just miss her. I should have IDIOT tattooed on my forehead.
C: LILLI
D: Luisa certainly thinks so.
C: GUIDO
D: Does she? Did she really say that?
E: grasping at this
C: LILLI
D: Stop! I'm not going to act as a postman between you both. Come back to Rome. Make a movie. Go to work.
N: He sits. Lilli joins him.
C: GUIDO
D: No. Never. I've spent this time trying to learn something, Lilli, to not be the person who forgets about everybody else, the person who never grew up. p. 90
C: LILLI
D: You're such a dope, aren't you? Making movies wasn't your problem. You were your problem. Don't stop being a child. You'll never make another movie! Nobody wants that... especially Luisa.
N: She indicates the people who pass.
C: LILLI
D: Guido - there probably isn't a single person passing by who hasn't been touched in some way by one of your movies. That's your gift. That's what you've been given. Use it. Just use it with some grace. For Chrissake.
E: CONT'D
C: GUIDO
D: The only movie I could make now would be... I don't know... would be about a man trying to win back his wife.
E: doubtful
C: LILLI
D: Sounds perfect. The costumes might not be so bad too.
E: after a beat
N: FLASH: Lights from a makeup mirror. A glimpse of a female eye applying false eyelashes. FLASH: A man of the collar applies pancake makeup, while a cigarette dangles from his lips. Young Guido, 9, appears and whispers into Guido's ear.
C: YOUNG GUIDO
D: We're ready to begin!
S: INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS
N: A surreal backstage, the cast of Guido's life, whores, models, schoolboys, priests, etc. A show about to begin. The music of "Be Italian/Folies Bergere" plays and builds throughout. People run past with props, lights, etc. Showgirls are
C: hurrying. A beautiful confusion.
D: p. 91
S: EXT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY
N: Guido pulls up in his car outside the soundstage. He stops the engine, and sits for a moment in silence. Summoning his courage, he gets out of the car. He is greeted by Pierpaolo. He seems to need and acknowledge his support. Pierpaolo is tender.
C: GUIDO
D: I can't remember how you do this.
C: PIERPAOLO
D: You'll remember.
S: INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS
N: The camera moves through the backstage mayhem. Mamma is in her dressing room preparing. Saraghina is sharing a dressing room with a Priest. He is helping with her corset. Carla and Luigi. Carla fixes her husband's hair. Claudia and Stephanie smoke and talk. Lilli adjusts her own, and other men's wardrobe.
S: INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY
N: Guido is in his element again, locked in passionate discussion with an ACTOR and an ACTRESS. In his hand, an actual script. The set surrounding them is modest; a tiny bedroom with a single window and rumpled sheets. The vast film Italia has clearly given way to something smaller, and perhaps truer: the tale of a man and a woman.
C: GUIDO
D: I don't want to say too much. The first way that we kill our film is by talking about it. But this scene is about reconciliation. And within the scene I would like you to try and find your way to begin that journey back towards each other.
S: INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS
N: Young Guido rushes by the dressing rooms.
C: YOUNG GUIDO
D: Presto! Presto! Take your places! Andiamo! Andiamo!
N: The dressing rooms begin to empty. p. 92
S: INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY
N: From high above on the soundstage catwalk, Young Guido watches Older Guido at work.
C: GUIDO
D: Maybe it's the most important building block that we have to begin again... We start from the beginning each time and I feel today as if I'm starting from the beginning. We'll just keep asking each other questions, and don't look to me for the answers, okay?
E: Continuing to speak to his actors
N: On cue, Young Guido opens the door behind him and ushers in THE CAST OF GUIDO'S LIFE. They enter with a sense of anticipation and excitement and arrange themselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loom behind Guido. They are all dressed in angelic white. But Guido is oblivious, focused instead on the task that lies ahead. He talks to his cameraman. Puts down his script. He takes off his jacket and hangs his glasses off his sweater, stands contemplating the set in front of him.
C: PIERPAOLO
D: Maestro, should I call final checks?
C: GUIDO
D: Yes.
C: PIERPAOLO
D: Makeup, please! Final checks!
N: A LONG WIDE PAN reveals a tableau vivant looming behind Guido like a glorious choir, his every muse, his every inspiration. They watch him as he begins to work. A part of him now and forever. Guido sits on the crane. The soundstage door opens, and we see a small figure slip quietly onto the set. Tentatively, she steps through the shadows. It's Luisa. From a discreet distance, she watches her husband return to his gift. Pierpaolo calls for silence.
C: PIERPAOLO
D: Alora. Silencio per favore. Silence please.
E: CONT'D to camera
C: Gyriamo. E alora motore!
D: p. 93
N: CLOSE UP ON THE CLAPBOARD. WORKING TITLE: NINE. DIR: G. CONTINI. As the clapboard strikes.
C: CLAPPER LOADER
D: Slate.
N: At the last moment, Young Guido runs fast, down the maze of steps, across the soundstage and jumps onto the crane with Guido as it begins to rise. Luisa watches. As the last note plays, the crane soars higher, carrying Guido up and up.
C: GUIDO
D: ACTION.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
