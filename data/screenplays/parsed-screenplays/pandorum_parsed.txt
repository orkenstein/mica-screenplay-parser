M: DEEP SPACE
N: A darkness like no other, a silence that is unsettling. Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across the void of outer space. Our own motion is only realized as an enormous object slowly moves towards us, taking shape. A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size, a tubular freighter easily ten times larger then any aircraft carrier. At first glance it appears lifeless and adrift, but slowly the small glow of cockpit windows come into view as we move closer. Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN.
C: BOWER
D: Where were you... when Eden was lost? Like every other kid on my block, I was in the middle of a dream, envious of those who were chosen to be part of mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of the unknown and trying to imagine what only the lucky few would encounter. We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and...
E: V.0.
T: DISSOLVE THRU:
S: INT. COCKPIT (EDEN) - CONT.
N: Inside the flight deck it's ghostly vacant, rows of empty flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently blinking. With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over the seat backs... it appears the control deck has been suddenly evacuated. Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship.
C: BOWER.
D: As the entire world watched in wonder, there were only a few, skeptical of the journey's success.
E: V.0.
N: (BEAT) Only a few... who would be right. The further we move into the ship... signs of violence appear, smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the bright white paneling and several broken computer screens. The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer... an argument between men, panicked rage over-lapping. (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: CAMERA slowly moves past a corner to see the middle-of a violent confrontation. One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic. Another OFFICER is on the floor, mortally wounded, his body still twitching with his head bashed in. The INSANE OFFICER, a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal, typing in commands with a casual and emotionless nature. Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose as he continues to type commands into the flight computer... heightening the trapped OFFICER'S muffled,. screams.
N: TRAPPED OFFICER (IN FRENCH) STOP IT! STOP FOR GOD'S SAKES! PLEASE!
C: GOD NO!
D: The INSANE OFFICER hits the final command key and warning buzzers ignite with flashing lights. He closes his eyes, taking a breath of relief.
N: TRAPPED OFFCIER (IN FRENCH) STOP IT! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL DO TO- YOU'RE NOT- STOP! YOU'RE GOING TO FUCKING KILL US ALL! The trapped OFFICER begins pounding on the glass with a crazed panic as the INSANE OFFICER calmly goes to his own sleep-pod and climbs inside, sealing the hatch. TRAPPED OFFCIER (CONT-D) (IN FRENCH) PLEASE GOD! NO! NO GOD DAMMIT! Control panels flash and hydraulics ignite. Like a row of tumbling dominos, each of the sleep-chamber pods shift positions with a SHUSH of hydraulics and then... they are launched with a ROAR of micro-jets.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SHIP "EDEN" - CONT.
N: We're suddenly back into the unsettling silence as... like a bee hive that's exploded, thousands of coffin-sized sleep pods are ejected from the ship in unison. They are sent tumbling into open space in every direction as the ship slowly continues its unaffected course. (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: The trapped OFFICER is seen SCREAMING in silence inside his own pod.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. OUTER SPACE
N: We slowly float towards an astroid field. As we grow closer it's the sea of sleep pods slowly floating through space.
C: BOWER
D: Where was I... when I heard we'd lost Eden? Just like every other kid on my block... I was dreaming... of being one who would be chosen to follow. As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods, it's obvious that time has passed, a single skeleton inside each of the pods, hands in a clawing position towards the glass. We PUSH IN towards one pod, moving towards the SKULL, still locked in a SCREAMING position, wide mouthed and...
E: P.O.
T: CUT TO:
C: M. HYPER-SLEEP CHAMBER
D: A RUMBLE passes... EYELIDS TWITCH... A GASP. Inside a coffin-size chamber, a dim glow of light seeps through a small glass porthole. A MAN is asleep, a mask attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms. CORPORAL BOWER, military physique, chiseled features. His chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins. Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life, muscles flinching, breath quickening. He squirms with discomfort, ripping away the mask. He gasps, trying to SCREAM.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - CONT.
N: His scream is muffled under three inches of glass. The hatch door is hit with a THUD and white gases erupt from the edges. THUD, THUD... THUD! The door bursts open and BOWER scampers out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the floor, naked and gasping. His pores ignite, dripping sweat. He tries to get to his feet, but his legs wobble underneath him, collapsing. He yells at the floor. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: BOWER
D: Burns are red! Bruises... blue- His voice echoes into the dark, alone in a cavernous room as he pauses, struggling for orientation. He gets to his feet, muscles twitching. His short-cropped hair is... pure white.
C: BOWER Hey...? HEY!!? Someone?
D: A constant low RUMBLE is present, joined by the occasional MOAN and CREAK of a large ship. A SHUDDER travels through the room with a random FLICKER of LIGHTS to reveal... A massive steel compartment, tangled with technology. It's cold and institutional. High-tech computer terminals slope out of the floor. The FLICKER passes, taking us into black. We hear him: fumbling through the room, switches are thrown with no result and compartments are pulled opened and... SNAP! A glow stick comes to life. He squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion. A drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his sleep pod. He grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from his arm and he sucks on the tube, pulling as much liquid into his mouth as possible. After a few heavy gulps, he suddenly heaves towards the floor. He painfully forces himself to drink, gasping. He looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own. He leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one, the name plate reading; 2nd Lt. Cooper. It's EMPTY. The third pod's name plate reads; LT. PAYTON. Deep inside there is the figure of a man, asleep under a mask.
E: CONT'D
C: BOWER
D: Payton? Lieutenant... Payton? He turns back to his own pod, seeing the name plate that reads; CORPORAL BOWER. Even this name doesn't seem familiar.
E: CONT'D
C: BOWER
D: Bower? Bower...? The loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver travels through his body while he staggers towards a nearby computer terminal. He taps the keys on a computer terminal. Nothing. He frowns, leaning closer.
E: CONT'D
N: (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: As he taps the keyboard, powder blooms out from under his fingers. He wipes the surface of the panel to see a thick layer of dust. Under the smear is... Elysium - Flight Systems - Operation Terminal #87153-D. He pulls focus to see... his FINGERS are trembling uncontrollably, an odd vibration of nerves. He slowly makes a fist with concern.
E: 2
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: BOWER walks along a row of storage lockers reading each name plate. He stops at the locker labelled; Corp. Bower. He pauses, mumbling the name once again with no recognition.
C: BOWER
D: Bower. He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized belongings, uniform and gear, none of it seeming familiar. He uses a towel to wipe off the layer of sweat and oily substance coating his body, pausing to see an identification tattoo on his forearm that reads: FLT>>005015. He pulls on a black flight suit, emblems and military markings of rank on the chest. He pulls on shoes and a tool belt with a high powered pen-lamp. On the inside of the locker is a emergency manual card with block figures displaying breathing and stretching exercises, labelled; Hyper-Sleep Disorientation Recovery Procedures.
C: BOWER
D: .in the event of mild memory loss... resulting from extended- He freezes on... A PHOTO tucked inside the door. EVALON, a beautiful young woman smiling towards camera. He stares at the-photo, his frown deepening with confusion. He checks the back for a name, but nothing. He tucks the photo into a pocket and exits.
E: CONT'D reading to himself
T: DISSOLVE THRU BLACK:
S: INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - LATER
N: BOWER waves his hand over a sensor... no power. He steps in front of a heavy set of steel doors, flipping several switches and... nothing.
T: CUT TO:
N: BOWER breaks open a storage bin, pulling out beverage packets and a cup, taking a seat at the control desk. With Evalon's photograph leaned against the console, he becomes lost in a gaze as he gulps down nutrient pills and stirs an instant coffee as we...
C: PUSH IN
D: There is a conflict in his eyes, memories trying to return.
T: FLASH CUT
N: An image FLASHES past, EVALON smiling as BOWER kneels next to her, gripping her hands. BOWER'S gaze remains hollow, frown deepening as he sips the cup and... winces with disgust.
C: BOWER
D: Faa-uck! Distant THUMPS. He pans the pen-lamp across the ceiling and toward the sounds... PAYTON'S sleep chamber. THUMP, THUMP, THUMP: Muffled and desperate. CRACK! Bower jumps back as someone kicks their way out from inside, the hatch bursting open. Out climbs... PAYTON, a man in his forties, but the rugged physique of a man half his age, lean and agile. His military-style hair cut is also pure white. Gasping for breath, he hits the floor as BOWER tries to help him. PAYTON jerks with shock.
C: BOWER
D: Whoa! Hey... easy! Lt. Payton? You're- Sir... whoa! PAYTON chokes and gasps, then glances up, giving Bower a once over with a frown and a sobering tone.
E: CONT'D
C: PAYTON
D: Who are you?
C: BOWER
D: Bower. Corporal... Bower, sir. I'm the-
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED : PAYTON (NOT FAMILIAR) Bower?

D: Corporal?
C: BOWER
D: Yes, sir. This is disorientation from-
C: PAYTON
D: corporal... Bower.
C: BOWER
D: Yes. That's right, I'm-
C: PAYTON
D: Wanna get that fucking light out of my eyes, pal?
C: BOWER
D: Sorry... sir. PAYTON rubs his face with a frown.
C: PAYTON
D: Where... are we?
C: BOWER
D: We're aboard the Elysium. From what I've
N: GATHERED- PAYTON (NOT FAMILIAR) Elysium...? Where are we?
C: BOWER
D: I don't... really know. There's no power in the com and I can't even-
C: PAYTON
D: Where's the... rest of the crew? It's our shift? Our rotation-
C: BOWER
D: I believe so.
N: (CONTINUED) B. CONTINUED: (2)
C: PAYTON
D: Aren't they suppose to be here... to wake us?
C: BOWER
D: Sir... I don't know where anyone is. PAYTON takes breaths, trying to regain his senses, glancing around at their darkened surroundings.
C: PAYTON
D: Hit the lights, will ya?
C: BOWER
D: Ah... we're having some power problems-
C: PAYTON
D: Who woke you up?
C: BOWER
D: Umm, not sure. It had to have been the flight computer. There's no one here... .except us.
E: off his look
C: PAYTON
D: Cold in here. BOWER grabs him a towel and water container, turning back to see PAYTON doesn't waste any time, stretching his limbs.
C: BOWER
D: There's no power coming off the main grid. Can't fire any of the... Dynos. Can't even open the doors. PAYTON glances to the other empty sleep-chamber with a frown.
E: searching for word
C: BOWER
D: Our 2nd Lieutenant? I don't know where he is. It was empty when I woke up. None of the systems are on-line. Mainframe is down, so I don't know how or why it engaged independently-
E: CONT'D off his look
C: PAYTON
D: Bower .
C: BOWER
D: Yeah?
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3)
C: PAYTON
D: Until I have two coffees you're just gonna have to repeat all this shit, so let's just idle here for a bit.
C: BOWER
D: Sorry. I just- Just glad to see you awake. i was... a little concerned. I didn't know what to do if- PAYTON gets to his feet, stumbling. BOWER catches him under the arm as they stagger into the wall.
C: BOWER
D: Easy... Lieutenant. Easy.
E: CONT`D
C: PAYTON
D: Coffee?
C: BOWER
D: I'm on it.
C: PAYTON
D: Good man. BOWER helps him to the locker room as LIGHTS FLICKER past.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: PAYTON staggers along the row of storage lockers as BOWER helps guide him with the flashlight beam. PAYTON pauses with a frown as he glances across the name-plates, none of them seeming familiar. BOWER gestures toward the locker, the name- plate reads: LT. PAYTON.
C: BOWER
D: This is you, sir.
C: PAYTON
D: How do you know that?
C: BOWER
D: 1 It's... the name on your sleep pod, sir. PAYTON opens the door to see his belongings inside, a photo of WIFE inside the door. He stares at it with utter confusion. BOWER takes this in, looking to the memory recovery card inside the locker.
E: MARIANNE
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: BOWER
D: it says that the memory loss is only suppose to be a momentary loss that's-
E: CONT'D
C: PAYTON
D: Very reassuring. I guess when you gamma the brain into extended REM, sometimes it can take a while to get it back. PAYTON pulls on his flight uniform and squeezes his feet into his shoes. BOWER notices the identification tattoo on his forearm, partially obscured from view; FLT>>00... . Unlike his own, PAYTON'S tattoo is faded with age.
E: obscured by grime, hair and angle
C: BOWER
D: I've been awake for at least an hour and I still can't remember my... anything.
C: PAYTON
D: Listen, the last time I crawled out of a hyper bunk, it took me... quite a while to get it all back. BOWER holds his frown as PAYTON squeezes his finger into a wedding ring.
C: BOWER
D: What was... your last flight, sir?
N: PAYTON (BEAT) Don't recall. The Kuiper Belt odyssey? Don't worry, it'll come back, eventually. PAYTON kisses the photo of his wife.
C: PAYTON
D: I've gone through this before. I just can't remember why I would agree to do it again. PAYTON goes to close his locker and BOWER motions with a serious tone.
E: CONT'D
C: BOWER
D: Sir? I know this is going to sound strange, but do you even know where we're going? I can remember the training, but... not the mission. Know the procedures, not the... destination.
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2)
C: PAYTON
D: I figured you'd tell me.
C: BOWER
D: Didn't even know the ship's name until I saw it-on the console. For all I know this was another damn training exercise-
C: PAYTON
D: Trust me, it's not. if this is a simulation... PAYTON notices both of their reflections off the mirrored panel inside the locker... revealing their WHITE HAIR.
C: PAYTON
D: Someone is taking the joke a little far. He shuts the locker and they exit, the flashlight's beam panning away, taking us into darkness.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT/CONTROL DESK - LATER
N: BOWER and PAYTON are standing at the control console, the screens flickering with distortion. BOWER hands him a coffee and PAYTON takes a sip... with a wince of disgust.
C: BOWER
D: None of the activators are working.
C: PAYTON
D: Figures. We can ride two hundred thousand tons of space freighter across the galaxy without a dent in the hood, but can't get one good cup of coffee. PAYTON flips a few switches with no result of power.
C: BOWER
D: Without the mainframe, we can't connect. I don't know how we'll ever be able to- PAYTON is in his element at the control desk, flipping open an emergency auxiliary-power panel. He snaps open a handle and he forcefully gives it several rotations with a MOAN of whirling magnetos. The hand-crank allows a dim glow of electricity to the light panels.
C: BOWER
D: Oh, I- didn't even think of that.
E: CONT'D
N: (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: PAYTON gives him a look with a grin and flips a switch.
C: PAYTON
D: Payton on the con. Respond? This is Lt. Payton of flight Team...? Shit-
C: BOWER
D: Five.
C: PAYTON
D: Five? How do you know that? BOWER pulls up his sleeve, exposing his tattoo ID. PAYTON nods, "good thinking."
C: PAYTON
D: Lt. Payton of Flight Team Five. Does anyone copy? Anyone... respond? Anyone awake up there? Dead static.
E: CONT-D
C: BOWER
D: Team Four suppose to be here for the shift rotation. Where could they be?
C: PAYTON
D: Fucking teamsters. Maybe they couldn't get to us. BOWER eyes the third empty sleep-chamber.
C: BOWER
D: Where could he have gone? PAYTON gazes off blankly. A RUMBLE of FLICKERING LIGHTS pass and the computer screens slowly fade, going black.
C: PAYTON
D: The power systems must be free-floating off blown circuits or something. The over-ride grid won't even lock in.
C: BOWER
D: Whatta ya think?
C: PAYTON
D: I think we need to find a deck of cards and call the union. Distant THUMPS are heard overhead and they freeze... watching the ceiling with uncertainty.
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2)
C: BOWER
D: Somebody... is up there.
C: PAYTON
D: Hmm. Ventilation... maybe. Systems keep re-booting after each surge. That could be anything. THUMPS fade as the ship eerily MOANS and CREAKS.
C: PAYTON
D: I say we get out of here. I'd rather be up and out then stuck in the trunk. The room is blocked by the two heavy steel doors on either end, security doors ten feet wide. PAYTON leads the way towards one end, gesturing towards the doors.
E: CONT'D
C: PAYTON
D: We're not far from the bridge but without the circuits locked in... I don't know how we could ever get this thing open. As they approach, their flashlight beams pan across the door to see jagged chips and scratches all along the edges. Tools are scattered on the floor, the control panel ripped open.
E: CONT'D
C: BOWER
D: Jesus. Somebody was trying to get out.
C: PAYTON
D: Ironic. I think it was built to protect us.
C: BOWER
D: Well, he got out... some how. A RUMBLE approaches... another SHUDDER that FLICKERS the lights. They watch the ceiling as BOWER counts in his head as it fades.
E: gesturing to the third pod
C: BOWER
D: Cycle is broken.
E: CONT'D
N: I
C: PAYTON
D: What?
C: BOWER
D: It's not circuitry. Reactor timing is off-set in the core. Seems sporadic, but it's not. Each revolution decreasing before starting over from the beginning.
N: (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3)
C: BOWER
D: It's trying to reconnect, but it won't until it's reset.
E: CONT'D
C: PAYTON
D: How the hell do you know that?
C: BOWER
D: I dunno. I can't remember my own- but I know everything there is to know about that damn reactor.
C: PAYTON
D: The training stuck.
C: BOWER And I know that...
D: Another SHUDDER approaches.
C: BOWER
D: That's twelve revolutions, before recycling. And this one will only last- As they watch the ceiling, their flashlight beams stop on a small ventilation shaft that's been ripped open. They exchange a look and...
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Their lights spill inside an endless steel shaft only a foot and a half in diameter, leading into darkness.
C: PAYTON
D: Now if we only had a monkey and a rope. PAYTON climbs down as BOWER rotates his jaw with eagerness.
C: BOWER
D: Our 2nd Lieutenant must have gone this way. Don't you think?
C: PAYTON
D: Must have.
C: BOWER
D: It's the only way out.
C: PAYTON
D: I think we're better off... waiting here-
C: BOWER
D: For what? If the mainframe is off-line-
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED :
C: PAYTON
D: We're not going to be able to get to the bridge or even be able to open that door from the other side-
C: BOWER
D: But we can at least find out what's
N: HAPPENED-
C: PAYTON
D: Do you remember just how big this ship is, kid? We don't know where that will come out, if at all-
C: BOWER
D: But, we can at least try to-
N: PAYTON (SOBERLY) I can't do that.
C: BOWER
D: Can't do... Sir?
C: PAYTON
D: Listen, I have to take a handful of Doxitol just to get in the hyper-bunk.
C: BOWER
D: You're... claustrophobic?
C: PAYTON
D: I can take a lot, that's not one of 'em.
N: BOWER (BOLDLY) I can take it. PAYTON (SIGH) Real boy scout, is that it? You get lost in there and you're a footnote in the FLIGHT REPORT-
C: BOWER
D: You can guide me... over two-way. PAYTON eyes him over with reluctance.
C: BOWER
D: You know there's something wrong. How long can we wait in here before we have to try something?
E: CONT'D
N: (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2)
C: BOWER
D: How long did he wait? Silent stare as a SHUDDER passes, flickering the lights.
E: CONT'D gesturing to 2nd Lt pod
C: BOWER
D: What if no one else is awake and there's no one at the wheel?
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: They dig through compartments, collecting tools. BOWER puts on a boom-mic, clips the radio on his belt and tests the transmitter. PAYTON goes through a drawer of office supplies, handing him an ENVELOPE OPENER.
C: PAYTON
D: Just in case... .there's mail you need to open quickly. BOWER tucks it into a zipper pocket and his photograph falls out. PAYTON watches as he tucks it back in and zips up.
E: off his look
C: PAYTON
D: Wife...?
E: CONT'D
C: BOWER
D: Yeah... I think so.
C: PAYTON
D: Must be newlyweds. How can you forget something like that?
C: BOWER
D: What do-you remember? Anything yet?
C: PAYTON
D: Some pieces.
N: (EYES NARROWING) Still a little fuzzy but you're the cocky little shit who wanted the window seat?
C: BOWER
D: And you're the cranky old bastard who made me take the aisle.
C: PAYTON
D: Give it some more time, pal.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER
N: BOWER squeezes inside, pushing himself forward several feet as PAYTON peeks inside behind him. With one last look, BOWER holds the pen-lamp in his teeth and begins to crawl, pushing himself forward on his stomach, only several inches at a time in a rhythmic motion. Grunt, slide, breath. Grunt, slide, breath. PAYTON'S flashlight slowly fades from sight.
T: DISSOLVE THRU BLACK:
S: INT. VENTILATION SHAFT - LATER
N: Slowly the sound approaches... Grunt, slide, breath. Grunt, slide breath. BOWER'S pen-lamp slowly emerges and he pauses to catch his breath. With anxiety shown across his sweat coated face, he squints down the endless shaft. BOWER (GASPING) Dammit. PAYTON'S voice crackles over the radio.
C: PAYTON
D: How we doing?
E: ON RADIO
C: BOWER
D: Nothing yet. Christ, not a single vent opening or- Nothing. How about on your end?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT.
N: PAYTON is seated at the control desk, the light panel fading. He hand-cranks the auxiliary handle and then continues tapping the keys as they flicker with distortion.
C: PAYTON
D: Power surges keep coming across in longer increments, just like you said.
N: (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:

D: I'm gonna keep trying to get inside and run a dyno. Or at least try to get a pizza delivered.
E: CONT'D

C: BOWER
D: Hey? BOWER quickly pushes himself forward reaching an intersection in the shaft.
C: BOWER
D: Got an intersection here.
E: CONT'D
C: PAYTON
D: What are the choices? The light pans to endless shafts in each direction. He SNAPS a glow stick to life, letting it drop down the vertical shaft... silently into nothing.
E: ON RADIO
C: BOWER
D: A whole lot of the same... nothing.
C: PAYTON
D: If you're gonna take a turn let's keep track. That way you can get back if there's no way out.
E: ON RADIO
C: BOWER
D: Don't say that. BOWER lowers his head, breathing heavily.
C: PAYTON
D: If you haven't seen anything yet... maybe you should head back now. BOWER sets his jaw and suddenly spots a SPIDER, gently dropping down from a string of web. It lands and quickly scurries away.
E: ON RADIO
C: BOWER
D: I'll be damned. BOWER collects himself, a tightened jaw of determination.
E: under his breath
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: BOWER
D: I'm taking a left. Make a note.
E: CONT'D
C: PAYTON
D: Left it is. BOWER turns the corner to follow the spider's path, the glow of the lamp slowly fading.
E: ON RADIO
T: DISSOLVE THRU:
S: INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK
N: A wall of monitors FLICKER, only offering a quick glance of surveillance cameras on the ship, images too quick and distorted to recognize but resembling empty corridors and vast cargo compartments.
C: I
D: PAYTON looks to the name plate that reads Elysium and a small emblem above it, a global shape with a spiral design.
C: PUSH IN
D: As he stares at the emblem, it seems memories are returning, a frown hardening on his face. Distant THUMPS snap him from his trance and he pans his flashlight towards the wall.
C: THUMP... SCRAPE... THUMP.
D: He nervously pans his light slowly up the wall and across the ceiling. A shiver of uneasiness goes through him as he sits, trapped within the room alone. He tries to divert his fears, turning to the control screen, giving the hand-crank a whirl.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. VENTILATION SHAFT - LATER
N: Pitch black. Grunt, slide, breath. Grunt, struggle, breath. BOWER pauses, digging for his lamp. He's soaked with sweat, eyes nearing desperation. Pipes are cutting through the shaft on both sides, making his crawl space even smaller and much more difficult. BOWER (GASPING) Payton? Nothing but STATIC. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: BOWER
D: Payton!? Do you copy!? HEY!? Finally...
E: CONT'D
C: PAYTON
D: I'm here. You alright? BOWER rubs the sweat from his eyes, anxiety increasing with his heavy breathing.
E: ON RADIO filled with static
C: BOWER
D: I dunno. I dunno if I can- I can't tell if I'm going in circles or- There's nothing to- Can't breath-
C: PAYTON
D: Easy, pal. Breath easy. Listen to me- BOWER squirms, pushing outward against the walls of the shaft with an increasing panic.
C: BOWER
D: I just want... to stand up for God's sakes! Can't breath-
C: PAYTON
D: Calm down. Listen, you gave it a shot. Let's get you back here.
E: ON RADIO

C: BOWER No, no... N00000!
D: He slides head first into a vertical drop, the shaft tightening like a funnel, crushing his lungs and SLAM! He crashes into a steel grate where his flashlight lays. It's a nightmarish head stand, his neck twisted with all his weight on top of himself, squirming with no where to squirm.

A SHUDDER that sends a domino effect of metallic CLANKS towards him from below. Small shafts of light break through as small vents open in the side walls. His fingers dig the envelope opener from his pocket as the RUMBLE fades, CLANKING the vents shut just as... He stabs the envelope opener into an open vent. Metal bends. He begins to BANG his elbow against the vent, over and over. BANG! BANG! BANG! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:

He walks to the edge of the next corridor and pauses with a frown. Glancing down the side corridor, fifty yards away, something is off. Within the symmetrical framing of steel, there is a rounded shape that is out of place. Be cautiously steps closer as the object takes the shape of... a MAN, standing at the edge of a doorway, head slightly cocked, peeking out.

D: Something is just beyond the wall, trying to get in. PAYTON back pedals, searching for any form of a weapon. He SNAPS the handle off a storage bin, wielding it like a baseball bat as he slowly back pedals to the control desk.

D: As he moves across the massive room, the neatly lined rows gradually become more dishevelled, chairs knocked over and unknown liquid dripping from the tables. Garbage litters the floor, a dim glow of light emerging from the galley. He crawls along the edge of the counter and peeks inside the galley, horribly ran-sacked. In the midst of the wreckage, a darkened FIGURE is seen scavenging through the cupboards, angrily tossing empty containers aside. The FIGURE pauses, sensing a presence and glances back as... BOWER ducks. He contemplates, pulling out the envelope opener and slowly peeks back out and... POW! He's HIT in the face, blood spraying, slamming onto his back. The pen-lamp and envelope opener spin across the floor. BOWER tries to get up and he's grabbed by the hair, a blade pressed against his neck.

D: Don't you move MOTHER FUCKER! She quickly pats him down, stealing tools. All he can see is her bare feet, blackened from oil. He frowns to see her toe- nails painted with bright pink polish. NADIA, a torn jump suit, snarled hair hiding her face, skin smeared with oil. A beautiful woman underneath an apocalyptic smear of grunge. Her hair is pure white, high- lighted with smears of oil.

D: Bower? You there-? BOWER lunges and they go into a violent spin, crashing over a table. Dishes clatter, gasps and grunts... only glimpses of the fight through the flicker of light. CRACK! BOWER'S hit, sent flying and he looks up to see her silhouette approaching, edged weapon in her hand.
E: ON RADIO

D: Stop! Stop it! Listen to me! Hold it! she attacks and he frantically throws dishes and chairs to fend her off. She throws the blade, the blunt end deflecting off his forearm.
C: BOWER
D: You crazy fucking bitch- He wields the only weapon he can find... his shoe. And her attack abruptly halts, slowly back pedalling with fright. BOWER is confused, realizing her eyes are looking past him. A BLUISH GLOW seeps in from the doorway, approaching from the corridor. He looks back to see NADIA is running for the kitchen... gone.

C: SHIT-
D: He ducks below the tables as a FIGURE slowly enters the room, carrying a long steel spear-like device with a splinter of blinding BLUE FIRE on the tip, fueled with a chemical sprayer like a welder's torch. His obstructed view reveals the FIGURE as a tribal warrior, scantily clad, elongated muscular frames, pale skin coated in hydraulic fluid. Bald head with clumps of tangled hair. It moves smoothly and silently, jabbing the tip of the flaming device into each corner and crevasse, as if flushing out anything hidden.
C: BOWER
D: What the hell is- The FIGURE quickly spins his direction and SNAPS a lever on the spear-device, killing the blue flame and taking us instantly into darkness. BOWER holds his breath with fright, back pedalling on his knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark. He takes an uneasy breath to realize... there is more then one. Slowly moving out of the shadows, four more HUNTERS slowly emerge, like a unified pack on the prowl. They carry an assortment of crudely made weapons, spears and blades of sharpened metal. The apparent leader of the pack is HEFLIN, the largest and strongest of the group and he directs the pack with an assortment of odd vocal sounds, deep HISSES from the throat

He spots an antique pistol. He breaks the glass, grabbing the gun, but it crumbles under his grip, falling to pieces. He sighs, but pauses to see... because the furniture is angled, his light spots a hiding spot underneath the desk. He pulls out a silver flask, bone dry. He reaches further, pulling out an unusually shaped weapon, much like a sawed-off shotgun with rounded edges. He snaps open the hand-crank I lever and gives a forceful whirl.

C: PAYTON
D: They did that for obvious reasons, not because of Eden. BOWER pauses... within reach of the window only to realize it was an illusion. A glass compartment door left slightly ajar was reflecting a circular light panel, smeared with oil to give the illusion of craters. His shoulders drop in defeat.

D: BOWER hits him in the gut, knocking the air from his lungs. SHEPARD crumbles, wheezing for air, going silent.
N: BOWER (ANGERED WHISPER) I'm not gonna hurt ya! Just shut the hell up! I'm gonna get you out of this thing. But, you have to be quiet, understand? SHEPARD'S gaze is hollow and disturbed, deeply traumatized. BOWER pulls on the wire that's rigged to the hydraulics of a nearby doorway, SHEPARD moans.

E: chuckle of disgust
C: BOWER
D: I don't know anything.

C: BOWER
D: What are you doing?
C: SHEPARD
D: Get the scent off.
C: BOWER
D: What ! ? SHEPARD rubs oil across his neck and then goes to check the corner, wrapping a strap around his fist to secure a screwdriver into his hand.
C: SHEPARD
D: I can't help you. I'm sorry.

D: BOWER shoves him against the wall with force. Their struggle i freezes as distant THUDS are heard down the corridor. They both look to see... the GLOW of BLUE TORCFE'S growing. SHEPARD begins to tremble, backing away. BOWER sets his jaw, stepping out into the corridor and slowly cranks the power- lever... with a WHINE of magnetos, raising the weapon.
N: SHEPARD (CONT'D) (TERRIFIED WHISPER) That's not going to help you. SHEPARD runs as BOWER hesitates, holding the gun towards the GLOW that grows brighter, HISSES and CACKLES approaching.

S: INT. FILTRATION COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: BOWER has a difficult time trying to keep up as SHEPARD weaves through a compartment filled with filtration units and a maze of piping. BOWER spots a clear path but BUMPS into glass. He realizes the compartment is separated by thick glass dividers. He changes directions and sees SHEPARD crawling through a vent. He tries to follow as... a BLUE TORCH moves past the doorway, bare feet running across steel. A collection of HISS and
C: CACKLES grow louder.
D: BOWER crawls under piping to hide. He notices the activation lights on his weapon fading... and he quietly tries to give the energy lever a few turns... but the WHINE seems too loud. He spots SHEPARD twenty feet away, hidden behind a console. I They exchange a look and SHEPARD angrily waves him away.
N: SHEPARD (MOUTHING) Don't follow me! I can't help you- SHANK! A wire noose SNAPS tight around SHEPARD'S neck. Much like a pole and wire rig used to wrangle alligators, the wire is released from the rig and SHEPARD bursts into a wild frenzy, trying to run while on a thirty foot long leash. The wire loops and tangles around the piping as... HUNTERS move in from every direction, blades whirling. SHEPARD'S SCREAM intensifies as the HUNTERS huddle over him. BOWER viciously cranks the energy lever on the weapon and climbs out of his hiding place as... SCREAMS intensify within the brutal attack as the HUNTERS begin to feed. SEEPARD'S neck is twisted far enough to SNAP! BOWER
C: FUCKING BASTARDS-
D: I BOWER raises the gun towards the back of the lead hunter, only fifteen feet away. He pulls the trigger and rusted metal SCREECHES! Jammed.
N: (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: He panics, grabbing the gun with both hands, checking for a safety switch and... KA-WHAP! The weapon discharges a tremendous BLAST of energy off to the side. -The weapon is designed to destroy biological and organic material, but for safety precautions, it's unable to penetrate man-made materials like lead, glass or steel. It's unable to puncture the ship's hull. The energy blast is an electrical discharge that CRACKS like lightening and echoes like thunder. The blast HITS the side of the wall with a deafening RIPPLE of aftershocks, shattering anything fragile and knocking over anything not fastened down within a thirty foot radius. This little thing packs a punch. The HUNTERS turn towards BOWER, the lead hunter turning to reveal itself as... } HEFLIN, a muscular-frame larger then the rest, skin glistening with a layer of hydraulic fluid along with tribal I scars and distorted war paint. His eyes hidden under shadow. He slowly lifts his shoulders while lowering his head, much like the fluid motions of a reptilian predator. BOWER frantically cranks the energy lever and raises it toward HEFLIN, completely unaffected by the threat. He squeezes the trigger and... KA-WHAP! The gunshot is THUNDEROUS, HITTING the unseen glass divider between them. The safety glass absorbs the blast, sending a SHUDDER through the hull. HEFLIN barely flinches, stepping closer with a HISS. Off his command, the HUNTERS take chase, swarming in every direction, searching for a route around the glass divider. BOWER runs for his life.

Hitting the booby-trap at full speed causes the wire to rip out of the door frame and... BOWER tumbles as the wire loops around his leg and he FALLS off the edge of a loading shaft, into an open elevator shaft that drops into darkness. The wire tightens and he's swung by the foot back into an open corridor, two floors below, like a demented base-jumper. He SLAMS into the ceiling and spins wildly over the open shaft as his transmitter falls all the way to the bottom exploding on IMPACT.

The flashlight is "on", illuminating the area. He pushes off the wall and reaches for it... fingers touching, but unable to grab it. The GLOW of torches grows in the loading shaft and BOWER pushes off, reaching for the flashlight. Unable to retrieve it, instead he pushes it... into the open loading shaft.

C: SCREECH!
D: The cable is violently tugged from above, jerking BOWER upward, pulling him away from the wall. He spins wildly trying to grab back onto the wall as...
C: SCREECH!

C: BOWER
D: Please... don't- Please, listen- The FIGURE slashes BOWER'S sleeve, rips away the fabric and looks at his identification tattoo. BOWER quits squirming as the FIGURE leans closer into the light with a curious frown. TANAKA, a Japanese man in ripped and modified clothing. Unlike the awkward gauntness of the HUNTERS, he has a full- framed, hard-edged physique and soft brown eyes.

He climbs up the wall and wedges the panel cover over the shaft opening, jamming it closed with a screwdriver. He backs away, gripping the weapon, ready for anything. He tries to control his breathing as he sits... watches... and waits.

A rec room with several rows of pool tables, video games and a ran-sacked bar. The floor is heavily littered with broken glass and BOWER wipes his finger across a wet surface on the bar, tasting it with an eye brow raised. I BOWER (TO HIMSELF) Open bar. Gotta be... E-deck?

C: AAAAARRRRGF! !
D: A quick struggle ensues and just as BOWER is about to be sliced open... CRACK! The ATTACKER is HIT and sent flying. TANAKA has come to his rescue, twirling a pipe across his palms. The ATTACKER rolls to her feet to reveal... NADIA. She snatches a pool ball off the table and throws it directly into TANAKA'S chest.
N: TANAKA
C: UUUGH!

D: They're not- They can't be from this ship. They don't seem... human. Do you think something got on board or maybe
C: I something...
D: He turns to follow her and pauses to see... The BIO-VAULT. A large lab storage compartment that has been "lived-in" for a long time. A bed has been created from assorted chair cushions and there is a collection of scavenged items. NADIA adds to the items, dumping the belongings of her bag onto the floor. BOWER is in awe as he approaches an entire wall of glass test tubes, a maze of micro-biological containers, glimmering with condensation.
C: BOWER
D: What is... all this?
E: CONT-D
C: NADIA
D: Ecological Development, Embryonic Charter. Livestock and wildlife re- population. The rows of glass tubes are labelled, ranging from mountain goats to octopi, everything a new world would need.

C: BOWER
D: You've been living in here? You're... protecting it?
C: NADIR
D: It' seems to be the only living thing left on this ship worth protecting. Regardless of the situation, we still have a mission. We've only lost about thirty percent of the specimens, mostly reptilian class. Never was big into snakes anyway. BOWER doesn't share the attempt at humor, wandering towards a darkened digital screen on the wall, displaying a charted graph of the new planet, TANIS.

D: Tanis.
E: under his breath
C: NADIA
D: You couldn't remember?
E: off his look
C: BOWER
D: No, I- I didn't remember just how far away it is... until now. This was a hundred and twenty-three year flight. NADIA begins to gather a few items shoving them into a bag. TANAKKA leans closer to the glass display with fascination, tapping the tubes to see movement inside.
C: BOWER
D: How could I have forgotten that?
E: CONT'D
C: NADIA
D: It comes only in pieces. Even after a few months. I know everything about this vault and its systems... but I still can't remember where I grew up. Or my brother's name. Only pieces... And the training comes back first. For good

C: NADIA
D: This ship was built to outlast our children's children... and any engineer could tell ya the warranty is running out. I think we've been asleep longer then you may think. BOWER tosses the orange brick. to TANAKA and he sniffs it with a grin, breaking off a piece. NADIA finishes gathering tools and she slings the bag over her shoulder, "ready to go".

S: INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - LATER
N: PAYTON is asleep, seated on the floor, back to the wall. He is awoken by...
C: RATTLE... THUMP, THUMP!
D: He instantly grips the pipe and turns on the flashlight. The "SOUNDS" are closer then ever before as something is heard crawling towards the panel in the ventilation shaft.
C: ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP
D: A vent panel lightly RATTLES, the metal begins to bend.
C: PAYTON
D: You want in? Come and get it you fu- The screwdriver SNAPS and the panel hits the floor. PAYTON raises the pipe, preparing to fight and... A desperate gasp is heard from inside the shaft.
C: GALLO
D: Help... me! PAYTON pauses, angling the light inside to see... GALLO, a young flight officer, boyish innocence, short-cropped hair, heavily coated in sweat, desperation in his eyes. His hair is dark brown, the only person without pure white hair.
E: O.S.
C: PAYTON
D: Who the hell... are you!? GALLO is tightly wedged inside the shaft, squirming to crawl out, trembling with fear and exhaustion.
C: GALLO
D: Help me- I'm part- of the flight crew!
C: I'm- Please- HELP ME!
D: PAYTON oddly hesitates... before lowering the weapon. He digs into the shaft grabbing GALLO'S hand, pulling him out. GALLO collapses onto the floor, crumbling into a fetal position, naked. His hands are locked in claw-like grips, trembling uncontrollably. His gasps are rapid and unsteady.
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: PAYTON
D: Easy... Easy. You're all right. PAYTON runs to grab a towel and water. As he turns back he notices GALLO'S hip and legs are sprayed with dried blood. PAYTON kneels over him and GALLO spasms from his touch.
N: GALLO PAAARRRGH !
C: PAYTON
D: EASY! I'm here to help you! PAYTON lifts the bottle to his lips, but the water runs down his face, GALLO is frozen in shock.
C: PAYTON
D: Com'on. Try to drink a little. Here. GALLO is unresponsive, wide eyes locked in a trance.
E: CONT'D
C: PAYTON
D: What's your name? Huh? Can you hear me?
E: CONT'D
N: GALLO (MUMBLING) Gallo.

D: What's that? Gallo...? PAYTON frowns, mumbling the name with a hint of recognition.
C: PAYTON
D: Corporal... Gallo?
E: CONT'D
N: GALLO (TREMBLING) Yes, sir.
C: PAYTON
D: Where did you come from, Gallo?
C: GALLO
D: The... bridge. Saying the words seems to send him into a terrified trance.
C: PAYTON
D: The bridge!? Where are we? What's happened? Can you tell me-
N: (CONTINUED)

D: The more PAYTON inquires, the more GALLO begins to unravel, emotionally. His eyes widen with terror, breath quickening.

C: PAYTON
D: Corporal?
E: CONT'D
N: GASP, GASP, GASP...
C: PAYTON
D: Tell me... what happened? GALLO is hyper-ventilating, eyes wide with terror. A droplet of blood slowly builds in his nostril, refusing to drip. A low whine is heard in his throat as... LIGHTS FLICKER past.

N: A hatch is broken open and BOWER'S flashlight beam peers into a ventilation shaft. Twenty feet inside the shaft the walls are collapsed, blocking passage. NADIA sighs with dread.
C: NADIA
D: We can't get through this way.
C: BOWER
D: I'd prefer to stay on foot.

N: (CONTINUED) I
C: CONTINUED:
D: She leads the way along the wall and into a compartment of unimaginable size, fifty foot high steel walls that channel through the room. The walls are lined with hundreds of sleep chambers, stacked ten high on either side. They round a corner into the main atrium to see dishevelled equipment and smashed control consoles, scarred from battle. Old blood stains are worn deeply into the floor.
C: BOWER
D: Jesus... As they venture deeper inside they see numerous sleep- chambers, open hatches and empty. The further they move along the wall, more and more empty pods, too many to count.
C: BOWER
D: My God. They're... empty. They're all- Where the hell is everyone?
E: CONT'D

D: Wait a second. My wife-

D: Keep moving.

D: No, wait. My wife could be in here. BOWER'S focus completely shifts, turning towards the pods, reading name plates.
C: NADIA
D: What does she do? What's her specialty?
C: BOWER
D: She's not part of the crew, but spouses were brought with. I remember there were-
C: NADIA
D: Then she's not in here. This is development settlers. Engineers. NADIA quickly continues as BOWER tries to keep up.
C: BOWER
D: Do you know where the family members are-
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) NADIA (GROWL) Quiet! They look to see TANAKA has fallen behind, crouched and peering off towards the dark. He's poised like a dog on the prowl that's caught a bad scent. They crouch and crawl to the adjacent corner.
C: BOWER
D: I don't see what he's looking at, do you?
C: NADIA
D: We have to keep moving. We don't want to stay out in the open for too long. Especially in here.
N: BOWER (TO TANAKA) Hey...? Let's go! Distant THUMPS are heard somewhere in the room and they tighten up with their weapons, eyes scanning. TANAKA refuses to look away, poised like a hunter.
C: NADIA
D: We can't stay herel NADIA heads across the main floor and BOWER tries to wave him on, but TANAKA is locked onto something, refusing to waver.
C: BOWER

C: BOWER
D: How the hell should I know-
C: NADIA
D: He's hunting! Bagging the next notch on his belt. You wait for him! Good luck. I NADIA quickly heads deeper into the room and down a darkened and narrowing tunnel. BOWER hesitates with frustration. Having to choose, he turns and chases after NADIA. I They crawl through a maze of machinery and NADIA'S pace is difficult for BOWER to keep up.
C: BOWER
D: Wait! I'm coming- There's a CRUNCH under his foot. He lowers his light, picking up a small white object. He brings it closer to the light to realize it's... A HUMAN FINGER BONE.
C: BOWER
D: Jesus! NADIA turns toward him to see...
E: CONT'D
C: REVERSE ANGLE
D: Behind BOWER is a massive stack of human skeletons and carcasses. They've just crawled into a pit of human remains. They both back away with horror only to see a mountain of carcasses on both sides. The only route is upward and they begin to crawl up the slope on their bellies, over dead remains.
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) BOWER (CONT'D) (HORRIFIED) My God! Wait- Where are we going!? NADIA suddenly grabs him, a quick jerk to silence him. A SHADOW passes with a CACKLING HISS. They freeze, laying on top of the remains, the bones CRINKLING underneath them. The HISS grows stronger... and they look up to see a silhouetted HUNTER crouched over like a gargoyle on a rafter, leering in their direction. NADIA (WHISPER) Don't move. They try to remain motionless, but the slope of the remains i CRINKLES underneath them and the hill of remains begins to slide. The HISS grows stronger. They hold their position until... a SHUDDER approaches with FLICKERING LIGHTS. The power surge is enough to ignite a small landslide underneath them. BOWER
C: SHIT-
D: NADIA grabs his arm as bones snap and they slide helplessly to the bottom within a landslide of bones and flesh. The finally slide to a stop at the bottom of the slope and BOWER quickly raises his weapon towards the rafters to see... the HUNTER is gone.
N: NADIA (WHISPER) Where... did it go-? He pans the light and... ROAR! The HUNTER lunges at them from five feet away. BOWER is STRUCK with enough force to send him flying, CRASHING into a pile of bones. NADIA spins around with a bladed pipe in her hands... but the HUNTER is already gone. She spins back and... THWAP! She's HIT from behind and sent with break-neck force into the floor. The HUNTER pounces onto her back and a claw-like hand grabs her hair... teeth opening towards her neck and... POW! BOWER charges into the HUNTER, tackling it and they spin into a brutal and distorted fight, seen under the FLICKERING LIGHT. Even though the HUNTER is a smaller one,of the pack, smaller then BOWER, its speed and strength is in- human. It grabs BOWER by the head with a GROWL and... (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: THWACK! TANAKA lunges out of the shadows, delivering a blow with his bladed pipe into the HUNTER'S face. It's a hit that would normally kill anything, nearly taking its head off. The HUNTER stumbles, staggers and... HIIIISSSSSST! It HITS TANAKA, sending him airborne, nearly knocking him out. Under the FLICKERING LIGHT, BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA all attack the lone HUNTER, taking all three of them to bring it to the floor. They viciously pound it with pipes and blades until it finally stops flinching beneath them. Its pale white skin seeps a thick black colored blood. The three of them back away, gasping and coated in its blood.
E: 3
N: BOWER (GASPING) Jesus... Christ- Jesus- Its face is smashed beyond recognition, but its facial features are horrifically distorted, no sign of eyes under the shredded tissue.
C: BOWER
D: What the... what the hell is it!? The HUNTER flinches and our gang back pedals with fright. NADIA continues back pedalling, looking towards the rafters to see... HEFLIN silhouetted, leering towards them.
E: CONT'D
N: NADIA
C: ANOTHER ONE-
D: BOWER quickly finds his weapon on the floor and HEFLIN slowly begins to TAP his spear against the wall, echoing a continual clank through the hull.
C: BOWER
D: What is he... doing? BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA quickly realize the effect as shadows begin to move.., the room is filling with HUNTERS, alerted by the tapping of metal.
C: NADIA
D: Run.
C: BOWER
D: They're... everywhere-
C: NADIA
D: Run!
N: (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: A low gargled HISS is heard from HEFLIN'S throat. NADIA is already gone. BOWER and TANAKA chase after her as the walls come to life, HUNTERS swarming onto their path like a pack of wild dogs. Before diving through the barricade, BOWER looks back to see HEFLIN and his pack have paused... to eat the fallen HUNTER.

S: INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR - CONT.
N: It's a panicked and mad dash through the dark as they crawl through the barricade and run back into the main corridor of sleep chambers. HUNTERS can be heard closing on their trail. They round a corner and NADIA jumps inside an empty sleep- chamber, frantically trying to pull the hatch closed. TANAKA follows suite, jumping inside another chamber and BOWER scrambles, in search of an open door as footsteps are heard quickly approaching. In a frenzied panic, BOWER dives into the chamber with NADIA, tugging the hatch closed. FOLLOW THRU:
S: INT. SLEEP CHAMBER - CONT.
N: BOWER and NADIA are cheek to cheek in the cramped space, both gasping for breath and dripping sweat with terror. Through the porthole... silhouetted HUNTERS move past with weapons in hand, search and destroy style. One HUNTER steps up only a few feet from their porthole and they freeze, holding their breath. Slowly the HUNTERS continue past, the shadows slowly fading from sight.
C: BOWER
D: What the hell happened to them!? What the hell are those things!?

C: TANAKA
D: Japanese - No subtitles.
C: BOWER
D: I second that. Let's get the fuck out of here. Which way did we come from?
C: NADIA
D: You want to go back?
C: BOWER
D: No, I mean... let's just go!
C: NADIA
D: We should go back. Find a different path. I don't think we can get through to the reactor bay from-
C: BOWER
D: You said there was no other path.
C: NADIA
D: I'm ready to explore other options-
C: BOWER
D: Which way did they go-?
C: NADIA
D: You really want to discuss it here!? A RUMBLE is heard approaching and they all crouch in unison. It's a power surge that sends FLICKERING LIGHTS across the massive corridor and a BLINKING LIGHT is activated on a nearby sleep-chamber. And then... BANG! The hatch door is KICKED from the inside, white gas erupting from the seam. Our gang quickly crawls toward the shadows, crouching behind equipment to watch as... Another KICK bursts open the hatch and a BIG PASSENGER crawls out, slamming onto the floor with a shiver of agony, gasping for breath, muscles twitching.
N: BIG PASSENGER AA.AAAA.RGH ! (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: The BIG PASSENGER tries to get to his feet, gasping and heaving, mumbling in Russian. BOWER tries to stand but NADIA pulls him back.
C: NADIA
D: What are you doing-!?
C: BOWER
D: They'll hear him- They'll- We've got to
C: HELP HIM-
D: Footsteps thunder across the floor and... WHACK! The BIG PASSENGER is STRUCK by a single blow from HEFLIN. The HUNTERS have returned in full force and they come out of the shadows from every direction, bladed weapons spinning. BOWER pulls away from NADIA'S grip and prepares to intervene, but TANAKA suddenly grabs him, holding him back with force. With the BIG PASSENGER wounded and moaning on the floor, the HUNTERS gather in a circle in ceremonial fashion, praying thanks for the feast the ship has presented. They watch helplessly as the BIG PASSENGER is then brutally attacked and eaten alive. WEASEL leads other HUNTERS under the flickering light in a demented and twisted celebratory dance, a frenzy of pure evil. This attack is heard more then it is seen, under flickering lights, obscured view and most of the camera angles on Bower and the groups reactions. Frozen in horror, BOWER is tugged by TANAKA, following NADIA to the corner where she's lifted a grate in the floor. They climb into a shaft under the floor and into the dark as... The SCREAMS and HISSES echo through the hull.

C: GALLO
D: What are you doing? What is that?
C: PAYTON
D: It's just a sedative. Help you relax- GALLO lifts his fists with a threatening posture.
C: GALLO
D: Then you take it... and relax. PAYTON backs off, setting the syringe aside.
C: PAYTON
D: Take it easy. We're on the same team here. Alright?

N: A FLICKER of LIGHT passes to reveal... BOWER crouched inside a three-foot high, narrow passageway, a crawl space beneath a steel grated floor. He follows the tunnel into a large silo lined with octagonal filters. TANAKA and NADIA are both looking for a way out, jabbing pipes into the grate overhead, unable to budge it.
C: BOWER
D: Didn't we come through here already?
C: NADIA
D: We gotta find a way out.
C: BOWER
D: Out? Why did we come iii-?

C: CONTINUED:
D: They pause to hear... CLASSICAL MUSIC echoing from below.
C: BOWER
D: What the hell is that? They climb down the shaft, jumping from filter to filter. At one level they follow the sound into a shaft opening and towards the soft, warm GLOW of YELLOW LIGHT. They reach an open hatch, peering inside to see... Inside an empty storage tank, a comfortable living space has been created; numerous chairs surround a make-shift dinner table made from storage crates with hand-made candles and various food containers. The tank appears empty.
C: BOWER
D: What is this!? BOWER and TANAKA begin to climb through and NADIA hesitates with uncertainty. They crawl through the hatch...
E: CONT'D
N: FOLLOW THRU:
S: INT. TANK - CONT.
N: They climb into the empty tank, lined with valves and filtration screens. The music is playing from crackling speakers hidden in the darkened circular catwalk overhead. TANAKA goes straight for the food and as soon as NADIA steps through the hatch... a wire SNAPS! Levers clank and a mouse- trap has triggered... SLAMMING the hatch closed. Trapped! They instantly turn back to the door, yanking and tugging in a panic. BOWER pans his light towards the catwalk only to see a FIGURE (LELAND) scampering through the shadows. Another lever is turned and... F00000SH! A stream of vapor shoots out of several vents along the wall. The colorless gas hits them and they instantly gag, choking for air. With the slanted walls of the tank, there seems to be no escape, but TANAKA runs up the wall, diving and grabbing onto a pipe, climbing upward toward the catwalk. The shadowed FIGURE (LELAND) quickly hobbles to the railing.
C: LELAND
D: No, no, no. Back in der' big boy!
N: (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: LELAND uses a spear to jab TANAKA'S hand. He loses his grip and tumbles back to the bottom of the tank. BOWER pulls NADIR out of the way of the hatch.
C: BOWER Get back! BACK!
D: BOWER whirls the magneto lever on the weapon and he raises the barrel towards the hatch, nearly point blank. KA-CRAAAACK! The energy blast from the weapon hits the hatch like a lightening bolt sending a tremendous JOLT through the entire tank. A spark IGNITES the chemical gas and there's a BURST of flammable gas that rolls upward into the catwalks. LELAND is knocked off his feet and he GASPS with shock.
C: LELAND
D: Whoa... WHOA! What the hell was that!? LELAND is exposed from his hiding place, waving the smoke from his face, bewildered. He's an older man who's lost all vanity over survival. A thin-framed, spidery little man with assorted clothing and a clutter of tools on his belt.
C: LELAND
D: What did you do!? BOWER whirls the lever on the weapon and points it at him.
E: CONT'D
C: BOWER
D: Shut off the gas!
C: LELAND
D: Where did you get that? BOWER angles the barrel towards a vent blowing out the chemical gas and LELAND jumps with fright.
N: LELAND (CONT'D) NO-NO! HO-HO! BOWER
C: SHUT IT OFF!
D: LELAND scampers across the catwalk and quickly lifts levers and twists nozzles, shutting off the flow of chemical gas. His frown transforms to a grin, raising an eye brow as he stares into the barrel of BOWER'S weapon.

D: Com'in, com'in! Make yerselves at home. Just throw the coats on the bed and don't pet the rat, it's not mine. Just watching it for a friend. LELAND is excited to have guests as he runs along the catwalks, lighting candles and sealing valves. They watch him with leery suspicion, weapons still in hand.

D: You... live here?
C: LELAND
D: Sublet. Got a roomier flat in the bow for the off season, but from here, ya just can't beat the commute. He grins, expecting a laugh, but doesn't get one. LELAND eyes BOWER over, admiring the uniform.

D: Oh, no-no. No-can-do. I'm real touchy to the dust bug and who knows where yawl have been. No offense. There's something funky going around. But don't let that spoil the party. Here... LELAND lowers down a bin filled with assorted food items, using a wire to drop it to them. TANAKA sniffs it with suspicion.

N: NADIA (DEVASTATED) Oh... my... God... The CHILD suddenly crouches in a fighting stance with a i gargled HISS from its throat, the light catching its eyes to reveal WHITE RETINAS deeply hidden under a thin membrane of I skin.

Clinging onto the pipes and railings of the catwalks, the odd-colored algae grows more and more dense... a dim glow slowly coming into view from below. With a gap in the catwalk, BOWER leaps across, nearly losing his grip. He looks down to see an odd pattern of white shapes near the bottom. Squinting into the darkness, he's unable to make out what he's looking at and he manages to crawl down further, reaching a gangplank that crosses to the towering reactor. He motions for NADIA and TANAKA to stay put and begins crawling across... towards a darkened control panel.
N: LELAND is nervously watching from above, leaning further over the railing and... a pen-lamp slips free from his belt. The pen-lamp CLANKS off one of the catwalks and tumbles past BOWER... dropping to the bottom... hitting the floor and illuminating the strange white objects covering the floor as... DOZENS of HUNTERS, all sleeping. Their pale white bodies are intertwined and over-lapped resembling an orgy of the living dead. BOWER
C: CHRIST ALMIGHTY-
D: The fall of the pen-lamp causes one HUNTER to instantly spring to its feet, lifting its nose towards the air like a guard dog checking the scent. BOWER remains frozen, gripping the gangplank that hangs twenty feet above the field of sleeping HUNTERS. I Slowly the HUNTER returns to sleep, slithering its way back into the folds of flesh and BOWER continues his crawl across... reaching the control panel. Upon seeing the sleeping HUNTERS, LELAND fearfully backs away, exiting the room. NADIA and TANAKA grip the ladders, watching BOWER, holding their breath in fright.
N: (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: BOWER grabs a vine, but it breaks away and he dangles over the side, losing his grip. NADIA jumps across the gap and climbs down, extending her weapon for him to grab. Together they cling to the side of the reactor and BOWER taps the control panel switches and... nothing. His eyes widen with horror, quickly searching for a solution. He slowly pumps a primer switch and... the light panel flickers gently under centuries of dust and vegetation...

N: I
C: GALLO
D: Trust you? How can I trust someone who isn't even honest with himself. Tell me? PAYTON refuses to acknowledge him, continuing to monitor the control panel. He discreetly slides his hand closer to the pipe weapon as he senses GALLO'S presence behind him.
C: PAYTON
D: Gallo... you have to listen to me... Carefully. You don't haveto- GALLO steps closer behind him, his shadowed outline showing an imposing posture, his voice is forced and unsteady.
C: GALLO
D: Don't do that. TRAP... TRAP... THAP. Blood drops hit the floor heavily.

D: Don't... do what? PAYTON slides his hand further across the console, reaching for the pipe weapon, eyes on the screen.

D: Don't talk to me like some child that needs reassurance. Think I don't know the risks? Think I don't know this ship?
C: PAYTON
D: Take it easy- GALLO'S presence is felt behind him, his voice seeming to grow raspier and uneven with breath, anger simmering.
C: GALLO
D: I know this ship and what she's capable of better then anyone. I know her... and I know what she can and can't do.

D: .to stand-down... Corporal.
N: GALLO
C: NOT MINE!
D: PAYTON shoves himself out of his chair, reaching for the pipe weapon to find nothing! He spins to see GALLO holding the pipe and the pistol-gripped syringe, glaring down at him. The heavy streams of blood are oozing from his nose and ears, insanity shown in his hollow gaze.
C: GALLO
D: Who's being irrational here, Lieutenant? Tell me? Who's being delusional!? Hmm? PAYTON raises his hands, calmly submitting.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. REACTOR CONTROL TERMINAL - CONT.
N: BOWER and NADIA cling to the side of the reactor, quietly flipping switches and entering codes as... the sea of HUNTERS sleep below them. BOWER unfolds the auxiliary power lever, each movement creating a CREAK of rusted metal. He grips the handle and slowly begins to turn the magneto crank. The CREAKS of rusted metal and the low WHINE of magnetos grows louder. HUNTERS begin to stir in their sleep as NADIA watches them with fright.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL, DESK

D: This won't work...
C: GALLO
D: Shut-up. GALLO jabs the syringe gun towards the back of PAYTON'S head while putting one foot inside the pod.

C: SHUT-UP!
D: PAYTON continues entering the launch code as GALLO steps inside with his other foot.

D: PAYTON hits a key and LIGHTS BLINK. GALLO looks away for a second and PAYTON suddenly grabs the hatch lever... SLAMMING it closed. He cranks the latch, locking GALLO inside.
N: GALLO (CONT-D)
C: WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?
D: PAYTON wedges a pipe through the handle as GALLO violently kicks the hatch.
C: PAYTON
D: For your own good-

C: PAYTON
D: You're not well, Corporal. You just need the proper treatment-

D: This isn't your fault-
N: GALLO I'LL FUCKING CARVE YOU UP- HEAR ME!? I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FUCKING-
C: PAYTON
D: Your mind... has turned against itself. GALLO EXPLODES with RAGE... POUNDING on the hatch with a jack- hammer of fists, bones shattering in his own hands. PAYTON ignores his screams, going back to the console and typing I into the keyboard.

S: INT. REACTOR CONTROL TERMINAL
N: BOWER cranks the hand lever faster and faster, the MOAN of magnetos growing louder and louder. He gives one last spin and hits the primer switch. A split-second of nothing and then the panels brightly come to life. The digital panel reads: >> ROTATION SEQUENCE >> CODE INITIATE TO PROCEED >> BOWER takes a sigh of relief and glances to see NADIA is frozen with fright. He follows their eye-line to see the entire floor of HUNTERS are awake, heads turned towards them. HEFLIN steps closer in their direction with a HISS. BOWER gasps and the entire pack of HUNTERS moves toward them and... suddenly, TANAKA bangs his bladed weapon against the railing with a heavy CLANK! The HUNTERS instantly turn toward his direction and TANAKA throws his weapon, HITTING one of the HUNTERS directly in the head. TANAKA jumps to the neighboring catwalk and breaks through a hatch, coated with vines and vegetation. HEFLIN screeches a command and the HUNTERS ignite in a chain-reaction, grabbing their weapons and taking chase like a swarm of attack dogs. They climb the wall with inhuman speed and rush out the hatch, following TANAKA.
C: NADIA
D: Hurry! Go! BOWER turns back to the panel, flipping more switches and continuing the process as the reactor begins to HUM as...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LOADING PLATFORM
N: TANAKA is running at full sprint, bounding over dishevelled equipment and weaving through debris as the pack of enraged HUNTERS emerge from every direction to follow his path. One HUNTER gains quickly at a sprinter's pace and TANAKA runs directly for the open hatchway. (The hatchway they detoured earlier.) He dives through as the sprinting HUNTER is almost upon him. A booby-trap is sprung, hydraulic pistons SNAP a razor-wire that "clotheslines" the HUNTER, nearly ripping him in half as TANAKA hits the floor, rolls to his feet and keeps running. HEFLIN and the HUNTERS slash the tangled snare with their weapons, trying to break through.
T: CUT TO:

C: NADIA
D: Bower...?
C: BOWER
D: I'm going as fast as I can-
N: NADIA (TERRIFIED) BOWER- BOWER
C: WAIT-
D: He hits the final key as NADIA grabs his shoulder. He turns to see... WEASEL and numerous HUNTERS have them surrounded, waiting to pounce. With nowhere to go, they are done for as WEASEL CACKLES a command, the HUNTERS moving in, just as... SHIIIISSSSH! High pressure steam erupts from the reactor's pressure relief valves. The HUNTERS back pedal in fear as the ventilation system ignites... fresh oxygen hits the blue torches... BURSTING into BRILLIANT ORANGE FIREBALLS.. The HUNTER'S scatter in a panic as the BRIGHT FLAMES are blinding and a tremendous SHUDDER travels through the ship like an earthquake...

D: Let me out. I can... help. PAYTON ignores him, typing rapidly into the keyboard.
C: GALLO
D: I'll help you! Please- I can help! PAYTON runs over to the security door and hits a switch on the sensor. The door doesn't react.

C: CONTINUED:
D: WEASEL has incredibly quick reflexes as he springs back to his feet just as BOWER charges into him, slamming into a wall of burning algae. The fire quickly spreads across WEASEL'S skin, igniting the oil that's been rubbed across his body. With WEASEL SCREECHING wildly and engulfed in flame, BOWER viciously continues pummeling him, throwing a rage of blows until the body stops twitching. The flames begin to catch on BOWER'S arms and NADIA pulls him back. They look to see most of the HUNTERS fleeing the room, but others have grabbed weapons. BOWER grabs her arm, pulling her towards the hatch.

S: INT. CORRIDOR ATRIUM - CONT.
N: STEAM ERUPTS from pipes and LIGHTS BLINDLY FLICKER as HUNTERS scatter and run off in separate directions. Slowly, TANAKA emerges from a hiding place, dropping down from the rafters overhead. With a grin he turns to head back the other direction to see...
C: HEFLIN waiting for him.
D: They stare one another down, both raising their bladed weapons as LIGHTS shatter and implode around them from their own intensity. HEFLIN lunges with a HISS and blades CLASH!

C: HUNTERS.
D: What was once a dark and haunting chamber of metal, is now a disco tech from hell as lights FLASH across the corridor in what appears to be a massive riot, PASSENGERS and HUNTERS fighting.
C: ANGLE ON/CRANE UP
D: BOWER and NADIA run across the top of the sleep chamber wall, thirty feet above the havoc that's ensuing below. A LIGHT BULBS BURST as...
T: MATCH CUT TO:

N: (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: TANAKA tries to grab a hold of him, but HEFLIN digs in with his teeth, biting into his stomach. TANAKA screams, hitting HEFLIN'S head with everything he's got, but he won't let go. TANAKA lifts HEFLIN'S feet and ROARS as he charges himself directly into the wall, neck bones SNAPPING! HEFLIN goes limp, dropping to the floor dead as TANAKA gasps... looking down to see the damage has been done, blood flowing heavily. He takes a breath, turns to exit FREEZING to see... the CHILD HUNTER standing alone, sensing the death of HEFLIN with almost an expression of sorrow. TANAKA lowers his weapon and... THWACK! The CHILD stabs TANAKA in the chest with a small bladed weapon. TANAKA gasps with shock, collapsing to his knees, eyes wide before going to the floor. The CHILD begins to feed.

C: GALLO
D: Corporal... PAYTON slams him against the wall, making him older.
N: PAYTON (RAGE SIMMERING)
C: STOP IT!
D: PAYTON slams him again, a FLASH that reveals GALLO has aged almost matching PAYTON, their voices sounding the same...

D: I'll FUCKING CARVE YOU UP! Within the struggle, hands grab at weapons, a wrist is twisted... lining up both of their identification tattoos to

D: PAYTON is ALONE. He's just injected the syringe into his own wrist. He's the only person in the room. Heavy blood streams are running from his nose and ears. Y77e will now refer to PAYTON by his real name, GALLO. LELAND and GALLO exchange a look... GALLO seeming to snap out of his trance. LELAND approaches, wheezing for air.
E: 2
C: LELAND
D: We made it! We- I'm with your boy. I was the one helping with- GALLO suddenly SLASHES his throat! LELAND reels back in shock, throttling his own neck in horror, blood gushing. GALLO casually turns back to the console, continuing to type as LELAND tries to cry out, his voice gargled with blood as he staggers, collapsing to the floor. GALLO hits a key and LIGHTS IGNITE, the last door finally engaging. GALLO sigh with relief as the doors slide open revealing a corridor of stairs leading to the bridge. A warm and gentle smile widens on his face.
C: I PAYTON
D: Captain on the bridge. He heads toward the bridge, while flipping another switch that ignites the opposite doors just as...
C: ANGLE ON
D: BOWER and NADIA angrily burst through the hatch in the floor, jamming it behind them and run up the corridor. They see the doors sliding shut.
C: BOWER
D: That's it! GO! Go for it! With HUNTERS hot on their trail... they run full sprint towards the sliding doors. HUNTERS lunge out of side corridors with SCREECHING HISSES as BOWER and NADIA dive through the sliding doors... One HUNTER is crushed by the doors., split nearly in half with a heavy THUD of steel and a MOAN of hydraulics. The HUNTER spasms wildly, kicking and clawing as BOWER and NADIA back pedal into the room. HUNTERS gather at the gap, stabbing weapons between the doors, trying to crawl through with SCREECHES and HISSES of rage.
N: (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: BOWER and NADIA back further away, turning to see the room. The original room that BOWER woke up in now looks quite different with all the systems engaged, BLINDING LIGHT coming from the monitors and computer terminals. They move through the room, passing the empty sleep chambers and the control console, seeing the entire pathway of dripped blood across the floor.
E: 3
C: NADIA
D: Where's... your lieutenant?
C: BOWER
D: He's not my lieutenant. She frowns off his look and turns to see... LELAND on the floor in a pool of blood, throat slashed, dead. BOWER pulls the gun and heads into the open doorway leading towards the bridge as NADIA follows behind.
N: FOLLOW THRU:
S: INT. COMMAND BRIDGE - CONT.
N: A tunneled stairwell widens out into the main flight bridge. A stunning sight, a split-level glass control deck, rows of blinking control panels and flight chairs. It appears undisturbed, a thin layer of silt floats out from under their footsteps. BOWER leads the way, panning the weapon throughout the room with no sign of GALLO. On the far wall; cockpit windows coated with a black fungus that obscures the view, but hints to the illusion of outer space, a haze of cosmic dust without stars. NADIA (IN AWE) What's happened... to us? Where are we? BOWER goes to the nearest control console, tapping the keyboard. The computer instantly responds, data scrolling across the screen.
C: BOWER
D: Flight log. It'll tell us how long we've I been out... and how far we've gone. BOWER types in a command and the computer begins to scroll through the flight computer's time-code. Starting with the launch date and time the numbers begin to roll faster and faster. BLIP... BLIP... BLIP.
N: (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: NADIA walks towards the windows and suddenly jumps back with fright to realize one of the flight control chairs has a FIGURE sitting in it. GALLO, motionless and gazing toward the windows. Off her gasp, BOWER grabs his gun and approaches as the computer time-code continues to roll even faster with no sign of slowing... months becoming years. BOWER approaches from behind GALLO... his identification tatto now clearly visible... FLT>>004>>012>>. He cranks the lever on the gun with a WHINE of magnetos and the laser sights flare brightly onto GALLO'S back.
C: BOWER
D: Seems my little memory lapse has finally worn off... "Lieutenant". BOWER slowly approaches, moving closer to his profile, the stream of blood from GALLO'S ear shown running down his neck.
E: CONT'D

C: BOWER
D: Who the hell are you? GALLO keeps his gaze towards the windows, emotionless.

E: CONT'D
C: GALLO
D: I was younger then you when I first came on board. Funny, I can't even remember what it was like... before this flight began. It's all I know.
C: BOWER
D: You were the one... who first received the final transmission. Who refused to go back to sleep. You stayed awake... for all those years. What were you doing... what crimes were you hiding from when you took Payton's bunk? The time-code display rolls faster, years rolling into decades... BLIP, BLIP, BLIP.
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) GALLO (IMPRESSED) How the hell would you know all that?
C: BOWER
D: Is it true? What have you done to us? Where are we now? GALLO lazily nods towards the windows.
C: GALLO
D: Go ahead. Take a peek. You tell me. BOWER hesitates, looking toward the darkened windows. He stays with the weapon on GALLO as NADIA wanders toward the front control console, towards the glass. With the lights fading on the weapon, BOWER gives the lever a quick whirl, motioning the barrel closer.
N: GALLO (CONT ' D ) What are. you gonna do, Bower? There's no one left to hand out merit badges. No one left at all.
C: BOWER
D: And that makes it okay? To play God?
C: GALLO
D: You think God survived? He's gone... with the rest. There's no one left to judge you, Bower. NADIA approaches the glass, squinting towards the heavily smudged glass. She frowns, trying to wipe away the layer of sludge.
C: BOWER
D: Judgement will come for you. You think you could cover it? Your victims survived. Evolved. That's your creation out there. Your crime. BOWER jabs the gun into his back with force.
C: BOWER
D: And you thought you'd be able to hide it? Who would ever suspect that? Who would
E: CONT'D
C: ever remember? I remember.

C: GALLO
D: No world left. No law. No order. Only us. You the law now? You gonna be the one that brings order to what's left? Wanna take a shot at it? I did my best with what I was given. Wanna be King for a day? Give it a whirl, Corporal. I'd like to see how you fare. With the laser sights fading on the weapon, BOWER quickly cranks the power lever, keeping the gun raised- A slow grin spreads across GALLO'S face as he finally looks to him, revealing the thick streams of blood that have dripped from his nose, coating his chin and neck.
C: GALLO
D: Try to imagine it. Imagine... yourself for five minutes without morality. I'll bet you'd surprise even yourself, kid-
E: CONT`D

N: BOWER
C: HEAR ME ASSHOLE?!
D: NADIA suddenly GASPS... flinching away from the cockpit windows, having just seen what's outside. Her expression is ghostly as she back pedals.

D: What do you see!?
E: CONT'D
N: I
C: GALLO
D: You ready for the new world, corporal? BOWER keeps the gun on him as he goes to the windows. NADIA has a ghostly expression, unable to speak. BOWER leans toward the glass, squinting into the darkness and... SWISH! An object moves past the outside of the glass. He leans closer, squinting to see... a school of ALIEN FISH dart past. The shin is underwater. BOWER staggers in shock, back pedalling as GALLO continues to chuckle.
N: BOWER (DISBELIEF) We've... we've already crashed. We've already... we're... The time-code display rolls centuries past, more then a thousand years accounted for as it finally slows to a stop. BLIP... BLIP... BLIP.

D: I guess this thing does land itself. Just doesn't float too well. BOWER lunges towards him and GALLO is ready for this one, quickly countering his move and SLAMMING BOWER into the console. He unleashes a vicious BLOW into BOWER'S throat. BOWER collapses, choking for air and GALLO kicks the gun away. He kneels over BOWER, slowly pulling out a blade.
C: G_ALLO
D: And you thought you could be King!? He slides the blade under BOWER'S neck and... there's a WHIRL of magnetos. He looks up to see NADIA cranking the lever on the energy gun. She tries to turn the gun towards him and...
E: CONT'D
C: I
D: GALLO lunges toward her just as she's able to FIRE! The BLA..ST of energy goes into the console with a CRACK of 1 THUNDER, knocking everyone off their feet. Shattered glass and metal HIT the cockpit window like a spray of shrapnel...

GALLO is hit directly and thrown across the room as NADIA and BOWER are engulfed by the blast of black water, sent tumbling.

S: INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT.
N: The tremendous ROAR of rushing water rolls them down the stairwell and into the sleep chamber compartment in a raging torrent, a tidal wave slams into the wall. BOWER grabs onto NADIA and they claw themselves along the wall as computer terminals SPARK and LIGHTS go black. He pulls her to a sleep-chamber and he jumps inside the open hatch, pulling her with.

C: GET IN!
D: He pulls her inside and turns to the control panel. He hits the keypad to read: >>> DETACHMENT INITIATED >>> BOWER struggles to close the hatch as water rushes in, SLAMMING it shut on top of them. GALLO struggles to keep his head above water as the fast moving current SLAMS him into the edge of the doorway. His I fingers claw at the manual lever for the door, tugging and tugging with no effect as the water rises above his head.

They are sent spinning into a wild tumble as bubbles and gas erupt across the outer surface. BOWER and NADIA slam into one another as the chamber turns end over end. Its roll seems to slow for a brief moment and BOWER squints toward the porthole to see...
N: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:
C: POV
D: They are pulling away from the side of the ship. The exterior hull of the massive space ship slides past at a high rate of speed with a swirl of ocean water and bubbles. BAM! The pod SLAMS into something as SPARKS fly and seals are ruptured as WATER sprays in with a blinding BLAST. The chamber is sent into another violent roll as NADIA and BOWER tumble head over feet, as if caught within a washing machine. The chamber finally steadies as water washes across the control panel, one last burst of sparks knocks out the lights, taking them into BLACK. Only their gasps are heard as they squirm towards the upper corner... only a foot of air remaining. He grabs the mask connected to tubes in the side and pulls the straps over her head.
C: NADIA
D: I What are you doing!?
C: BOWER
D: 1 Put it on!
C: NADIA
D: No! I can't- Not like this! I'm not going to wake up and drowned-
N: BOWER
C: PUT IT ON!
D: He pulls it over her face as the water rises with only several inches of air inside the chamber. BOWER gasps desperately into the corner. NADIA gasps the air through the mask, making her eye-lids droop, slowly going unconscious. BOWER gasps one last breath and the water rises over his head. BOWER watches her body go limp and squirms for air as... a warm GLOW of WHITE LIGHT grows brighter through the porthole. As sunlight dances through the porthole, he kicks at the hatch and...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY
N: BOWER kicks open the hatch, gasping for breath. A gentle breeze ripples across the water with a sunlight flickering across the surface of an ocean. He pulls NADIA out of the chamber, ripping the mask off her face. Her eye-lids slowly begin to flicker back to consciousness.
C: BOWER
D: Hey...? Hey? She chokes on the air and struggles to orientate herself, looking up to see him gazing down at her, coated with bright sunlight.
N: NADIA (GASPING) Where are we? What happened? BOWER (GRIN) It's all right. It's safe to wake up this time.
C: I
D: With eyes of disbelief, they turn to see...
C: WIDE ANGLE
D: They sit on the edge of the sleep chamber as it lightly bobs within the ocean waves. They're just off shore from a stretch of mountainous tropical islands with waves crashing against the beaches. The unusual shape of the islands and their geography are nothing like we've ever seen on Earth. Several moons dot the sky and the sun is rising with a brilliant glow on the horizon.
T: FADE TO BLACK:
S: INT. COMMAND DECK
N: Pitch black. A low CHURNING is heard, a motor that is pumping as the water lowers, allowing us to see across the dishevelled command platform, the walls dripping with water. The water is being drained through the grates in the floor as unseen bilge pumps are heard loudly WHIRLING. The pump motors whine down and shut off as...
C: CONTROL CONSOLE
D: A hand flips off the switch for the ventilation ducts. It's
N: GALLO... (CONTINUED)
C: CONTINUED:
D: standing at the console, having changed clothes and recovered from the ordeal. He examines the empty tank where BOWER'S sleep chamber once sat. He eyes the other sleep-chambers, deeply contemplating. He goes back to the control console, scanning across the numerous surveillance monitors that reveal... PASSENGERS and HUNTERS engaged in a variety of activities all across the ship. Some are seen fighting, some searching for food, some searching for a way out, some alone weeping. A kingdom, for the taking. He pulls out a coffee packet and slowly begins mixing himself a cup, deeply contemplating as he looks across the screens. He glances over to see... YOUNG GALLO, the younger version of himself, who is seated nearby, watching with a grin. The blood is gone from his face, appearing clean-cut, clean uniform.
C: YOUNG GALLO
D: Well, if you're gonna be captain... what are we gonna do now? Off his look...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - LATER
N: SHUSH... THUD. Doors open to another sleep chamber compartment, completely undisturbed. Four undisturbed sleep- chambers are lined against the wall. GALLO enters, now wearing the CAPTAIN'S uniform, he straightens his collar and kneels next to one of the pods, typing into the panel. A grin appears as he removes the wedding ring (PAYTON'S ring) he'd forgotten he's still wearing.
C: GALLO
D: What is a King... without his Queen. He hits the control panel switch and...
S: INT. SLEEP CHAMBER
N: A FEMALE CREW MEMBER, a beautiful young woman, deep in hyper-- slumber suddenly twitches... her EYES opening wide with a GASP as she stares into CAMERA.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
N: THE END
