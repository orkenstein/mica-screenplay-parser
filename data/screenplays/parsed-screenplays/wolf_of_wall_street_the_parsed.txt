N: Gadgets, computers, oxblood leather furniture. With the DIN of the brokerage firm bleeding in, Jordan uses a credit card to cut a line of coke on his desk. As he peels a crisp $100 DOLLAR BILL off a wad, rolls it up:
C: JORDAN
D: Enough of this shit'll make you invincible, able to conquer the world and eviscerate your enemies.
N: He SNARFS up the line, gestures to the cocaine.
C: JORDAN
D: I'm not talking about this. I'm talking about this. (Jordan unfurls the
E: CONT'D
C: $100 with a SNAP)
D: Money is the oxygen of capitalism and I wanna breathe more than any other human being alive.
N: He crumbles it into a ball and tosses it into a corner, where it comes to rest with two dozen others. Over his back as we TRACK HIM out of his office toward what sounds like the ROAR of a mob--
C: JORDAN
D: Money doesn't just buy you a better life -- better food, better cars, better pussy -- it also makes you a better person. You can give generously to the church of your choice or the political party. You can save the fucking spotted owl with money. 6. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13

N: Arms akimbo, Jordan stands above the bullpen, a huge open space with tightly packed rows of maple colored desks.
C: JORDAN
D: But most of all, in any country in the world, money can buy you love. Fuck the Beatles.
E: V.O.
N: His 300 BROKERS, mostly young men with their jackets off, scream wildly. They worship him.

E: PRE-LAP
S: 20 INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY (MAY `87) 20
N: Computers, telephones everywhere. At their desks, 45 shirt-sleeved BROKERS read their Wall St. Journals, readying for war. Like an eager puppy, Jordan follows broker JERRY FOGEL, 30, thick-lipped and bow-tied...
C: JERRY FOGEL
D: You got a problem with that? Jordan?
E: reads name tag
C: JORDAN
D: Nope. No problem at all. 7. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: JERRY FOGEL
D: Your job is `connector', which means you'll be dialing the phone over 500 times a day, trying to `connect' me with business owners. And till you pass your Series 7, that's all you'll be doing. Sit.
N: Jordan takes a seat at the desk next to Fogel's.
C: JERRY FOGEL
D: Just so you know, last year I made over 300k and the other guy you'll be working for made a million.
E: CONT'D
C: JORDAN
D: A million dollars? I could only imagine what a douchebag that guy must be.
E: V.O.
N: A manicured hand lands on Jordan's shoulder. It's MARK HANNA, 30s, charismatic, movie-star handsome.
C: MARK HANNA
D: Jordan? Mark Hanna. Good, you've met Jerry. One of the smartest guys in the office. Who's ever sucked a dog's cock out of loneliness.
E: re: Fogel
N: Fogel's smile turns to a frown. He hands Jordan a stack of 3x5 index cards.
C: JERRY FOGEL
D: Smile and dial. And don't pick your fucking head up till one.
C: MARK HANNA
D: Don't mind Jerry, his father raped him as a child. Besides, I'm senior broker here, he's a worthless piker. I heard you pitched stock at your job interview.
C: JORDAN
D: Had to do something to stand out.
C: MARK HANNA
D: I fuckin' love that! Let's grab lunch later. Windows good with you?
C: JORDAN
D: Great. Yeah. 8. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
N: Hanna gives him a wink, looks at the clock on the giant electronic stock ticker encircling the room -- 9:30 a.m.
C: MARK HANNA
D: Let's fuck!!
N: RING!!! Absolute pandemonium at the BELL signalling the opening of the stock market. Feet fly off desks; Brokers and their Connectors dial phones like mad. The CAMERA PUSHES IN on JORDAN, mesmerized as he takes in the ROAR.
C: BROKER #1
D: Miniscribe's a fuckin' steal! Thirty eight bucks a share!
E: to Broker #2
C: MARK HANNA
D: Your broker in West Virginia? What are you buying, a coal mine? It's the 80s, the game is high- tech.
E: into headset
C: BROKER #2
D: Fuckface! I got 50,000 July 50s!
E: to Broker #3
C: JORDAN
D: You want to know what money sounds like? Visit a trading floor on Wall Street. Fuck this, shit that. Cock, cunt, asshole. I couldn't believe how these guys talked to each other--
E: V.O.
N: Fogel notices Jordan sitting there frozen. He covers his mouthpiece, kicks the desk violently.
C: JERRY FOGEL
D: Dial the cocksucking phone!
N: Jordan snaps out of it, starts dialing.
C: JORDAN
D: I was hooked within seconds.
E: V.O.
N: Mark Hanna slams down his phone in victory, scrawls out a "buy" ticket. He places the ticket into a glass cylinder which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube.
C: JORDAN
D: It was like mainlining adrenaline.
E: V.O.
N: The tube is WHOOSHED into the ceiling and we're suddenly-- The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
S: 21 INT. WINDOWS ON THE WORLD - DAY (MAY `87) 21
N: CLOSE ON a COKE SPOON whose contents disappear up a nostril. PULL BACK TO REVEAL... The lunchtime power spot with panoramic views of the city. At a corner table, a paranoid Jordan looks around as Hanna does another bump of coke. None of the other DINERS seem to notice or care.
C: MARK HANNA
D: Got enough for one more? Tootski?
E: offering the spoon
C: JORDAN
D: No. Thanks though.
N: Hanna slips the vial into his pocket as HECTOR, the tuxedoed Maitre'D, approaches.
C: HECTOR
D: Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon?
N: Hanna surreptitiously palms Hector a $100; Jordan notices.
C: MARK HANNA
D: Here's the game plan, Hector. Bring us two Absolut Martinis straight up. Precisely seven and a half minutes after you deliver those you'll bring two more, then two more every five minutes until one of us passes out.
C: HECTOR
D: An excellent strategy, sir.
C: JORDAN
D: Actually, I'm good with 7-Up.
N: Jordan might as well have farted at the table.
C: MARK HANNA
D: First day on Wall Street, Hector. Give him time. No thanks, I'm not eating.
E: Hector offers menus
N: Hector heads off.
C: JORDAN
D: You can get high during the day and still function? 10. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: MARK HANNA
D: High is the only way to do this fucking job. Guy who coined the term "three-martini lunch" was a woman. Cocaine and hookers, my friend, the keys to success.
N: Jordan smiles, not sure if Hanna is kidding.
C: JORDAN
D: I gotta say, I'm really excited about being part of your team. I wanna do all I can for our clients and --
C: MARK HANNA
D: "Here at L.F. Rothschild, our clients aren't just important, they're family." Just as long as we get our taste first. Remember something, Jordan, your top priority in this job: make us money. If the clients get rich along the way, bully for them. Got a girlfriend?
E: reciting an ad
C: JORDAN
D: Wife. She cuts hair.
N: Mark swallows a comment about that. Gets to business.
C: MARK HANNA
D: OK, first rule of Wall Street. Nobody -- and I don't care if you're Warren Buffet or Jimmy Buffet -- nobody knows if a stock's going up, down or fucking sideways, least of all stock brokers. But we have to pretend we know. Make sure you stay relaxed. Nobody wants to buy something from someone who sounds like they haven't gotten laid in a month. Take breaks when you feel stressed, jerk off if you can. You like jerking off, right?
C: JORDAN
D: Well... sure.
C: MARK HANNA
D: Good, jerking off is key. And I highly recommend cocaine, which will make you dial faster, which is good for me. Churn `em and burn `em, baby. 11. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
N: A BUSBOY stops by with a fresh napkin for Mark who thanks him. Then, discreetly as possible, Mark removes a fresh vial of cocaine tucked within and takes a quick snort. Jordan realizes: that's why he palmed the maitre d' $100.
C: JORDAN
D: For the next six months I learned the ways of Wall Street.
E: V.O.
S: 22 INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT (OCT `87) 22
N: As STRIPPERS grind in b.g, Jordan parties with Mark Hanna and dozens of BROKERS and TRAINEES. Jordan sips a martini and studies Mark Hanna, hitting on a STRIPPER.
C: JORDAN
D: That fall I passed my Series 7. Finally it was here.
E: V.O.
S: 23 INT. ROTHSCHILD BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY (OCT `87) 23
N: Briefcase in hand, Jordan boards the elevator with a dozen other BROKERS.
C: JORDAN
D: My first day as a stockbroker, a future Master of the Universe.
E: V.O.
N: And as the doors close, on screen WE SEE: OCTOBER 19th, 1987
S: 24 INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY (OCT `87) 24
N: Total chaos. Jordan dials the phone as all around him Brokers panic, screaming into headsets.
C: JORDAN
D: They called it Black Monday. By four p.m. the market was down 508 points, the biggest one-day drop since the crash of `29.
E: V.O.
N: 4 p.m. The closing bell RINGS; the entire place goes silent. Brokers look at each other, stunned.
C: MARK HANNA
D: Holy. Fucking. Shit.
N: And as the Brokers start commiserating with each other... The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: JORDAN
D: L.F. Rothschild, a company that had been in business since 1883, closed its doors within a month.
E: V.O.
S: 25 INT. JORDAN & TERESA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY (DEC `87) 25
N: Jordan sits at the table perusing the Times classifieds. Teresa approaches with two coffees. Sits next to him.
C: TERESA
D: So I'll take an extra shift, don't worry about it.
C: JORDAN
D: You work too much as it is.
C: TERESA
D: We could pawn my engagement ring.
C: JORDAN
D: We're not pawning anything. I'm gonna be a millionaire, Teresa.
C: TERESA
D: You know that doesn't matter, right?
N: He smiles, kisses her. Together, they peruse the ads.
C: JORDAN
D: "Nobody Beats the Wiz". I could be a stock boy.
E: points to an ad
C: TERESA
D: You're a stock broker.
C: JORDAN
D: No one's hiring brokers right now, sweetie.
N: They go back to the ads. After a few beats, she points--
C: TERESA
D: This place is.
S: 26 EXT. STRIP MALL - PARKING LOT - LONG ISLAND - DAY (DEC `87) 26
N: In a suit, Jordan emerges from an `85 Datsun. He looks around confused, heads toward an unmarked storefront. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
S: 27 INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - DAY (DEC `87) 27
N: The antithesis of L.F. Rothschild, with cheap furniture and a dozen misfit "BROKERS" giving loud, obnoxious sales pitches. Jordan enters, a modern man among cave people. DWAYNE, slovenly, 35, with a walrus mustache, looks up.
C: JORDAN
D: I'm looking for Investor's Center?
C: DWAYNE
D: That's us, hey. Dwayne.
C: JORDAN
D: Jordan Belfort, I called earlier. I was a broker with Rothschild.
E: as they shake hands
N: Dwayne motions Jordan to a seat. Nearby, a Broker in ratty Keds, TOBY WELCH, is screaming into his phone.
C: TOBY WELCH
D: I'm tellin' you, this stock is goin' up!... Cause I know,
C: okay?!... I have inside
D: information!
N: Jordan looks at him, appalled at what he's hearing.
C: JORDAN
D: Where are your quotrons?
C: DWAYNE
D: No quotrons, we sell off the pink sheets -- penny stocks.
N: Dwayne slides Jordan a large thin book; its pages are literally pink. He explains as Jordan flips the pages:
C: DWAYNE
D: Company don't have enough capital to be listed on NASDAQ, their shares trade here. Like these guys, Aerotyne? They make radar detectors out of a garage in Dubuque.
E: CONT'D points to the book
C: JORDAN
D: Six cents a share? Who buys this crap?
C: DWAYNE
D: Schmucks mostly. Mailmen, plumbers, people thinking they can get rich quick. They answer our ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler. 14. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: JORDAN
D: The spread on these is huge.
C: DWAYNE
D: So's your commission, that's the point. Blue chips stocks you get what, one percent? Pink sheets are fifty.
C: JORDAN
D: Wait a second. You're telling me if I sell two thousand dollars worth of stock, my commission is a thousand bucks?
C: DWAYNE
D: Technically, yeah, but not even the biggest schmuck buys two thousand dollars of this shit.
S: 28 INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - (LATER THAT) DAY (DEC '87) 28
N: As others Brokers bark into phones, Jordan sits, phone cradled in his shoulder, making notes. A few beats, then:
C: JORDAN
D: Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan Belfort with Investor's Center in New York City. You recently responded to one of our ads...
E: into phone
N: A few of the other Brokers glance over, eavesdropping.
C: JORDAN
D: The reason I'm calling is that an extremely exciting investment opportunity crossed my desk today. Typically our firm recommends no more than five stocks per year: this is one of them...
E: CONT'D
N: A few more Brokers look over...
C: JORDAN
D: Aerotyne International is a cutting edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on a new generation of radar equipment...
E: CONT'D
N: LATER. Now all the Brokers listen in rapt attention. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: JORDAN
D: -- so if Aerotyne's shares rise to only a dollar -- and our research indicates they could go much, much higher -- your profit on a mere three thousand dollar investment would be upwards of fifty thousand... That's right, you could pay off your mortgage.
E: CONT'D
N: Seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing:
C: JORDAN
D: Four thousand dollars, will that be check or money order?... Thank you, sir.
E: CONT'D
N: Jordan hangs up, scrawls out a "buy" ticket.
C: JORDAN
D: Just like that I made two grand. The other guys looked at me like I'd just discovered fire.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Toby Welch and the other cave-Brokers stare at him.
C: TOBY WELCH
D: How'd you fuckin' do that?
S: 29 INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - (ANOTHER) DAY (FEB `88) 29
N: Jordan sits at his desk in mid-pitch, totally focused.
C: JORDAN
D: It's a rock-solid company, sir, it's the next Microsoft... Six thousand. Terrific.
N: As Jordan continues talking, wrapping up the sale...
C: JORDAN
D: Though I knew I was selling garbage, within twelve weeks I was making a fortune.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: And as he starts scrawling out a buy ticket...
C: JORDAN
D: And as a wise man once told me, my only responsibility was to put meat on the table.
E: V.O.
N: CLOSE ON a 1988 Jaguar, parked outside a diner... The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
S: 30 INT. KACANDES DINER - BAYSIDE - DAY (JUN `88) 30
N: Wearing a suit, Jordan sits in a booth reading the Wall Street Journal as a WAITRESS serves the food. DONNIE AZOFF, preppy-looking, 25, with horn-rims and bright white teeth approaches from the takeout counter.

C: JORDAN
D: Yeah.
C: DONNIE
D: Nice ride. Donnie Azoff.

D: Get the fuck out. You made seventy grand in one month.
C: JORDAN
D: Seventy two actually.
N: Donnie studies him, isn't sure if he's full of shit.
C: DONNIE
D: Tell you what. You show me a pay stub with $72,000 on it, I'm quitting my job right now and coming to work with you.
N: As Jordan retrieves his briefcase to find a paystub -- * 30A SCENE 30A OMITTED *30A 30B As Jordan hands Donnie his paystub and sure enough, it's *30B north of seventy-two k. * The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: DONNIE *
D: Holy shit.
E: CONT'D
N: Jordan watches as Donnie crosses to a pay phone and dials.
C: JORDAN
D: And he did quit his job, which I thought was a little weird. I mean I had just met this fucking guy.
E: V.O.
N: A few beats, then into phone:
C: DONNIE
D: Yo Paulie, it's Donnie... Yeah, listen, I quit.
N: Jordan studies Donnie as he continues his conversation...
C: JORDAN
D: There were other things about him too, like his phosphorescent white teeth and the fact that he wore horn rims with clear lenses to look more Waspy. He also married his first cousin --

C: DONNIE
D: No problem, if we have a kid who's a retard, we'll just leave it on the steps of some institution.

N: Jordan and Donnie get high. Donnie holds a flame under a crack pipe. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: JORDAN
D: The weird thing was when he'd do crack, his face would contort into this bizarre, frozen mask like the Phantom of the Opera.
E: V.O.
N: Donnie does a hit of crack; his jaw twitches, then his facial muscles contort, locking up like a stroke victim. After a few beats, he hands the pipe to Jordan.
C: DONNIE
D: You now, take a hit!
N: Jordan takes a deep hit and holds it. A beat, then:
C: JORDAN
D: Omigod, I fuckin' love you!!

D: I knew I had to make him my partner.
E: V.O.
S: 34 INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - DAY (SEP `88) 34

C: TERESA
D: Omigod. Jordan.

D: You like it?

N: Jordan helps her try it on. She smiles, but he detects a wave of... something.
C: JORDAN
D: They're small, I know, but the stones are really high quality.
C: TERESA
D: No, no. I love it.
C: JORDAN
D: Then what?
N: They sit in silence. Finally:
C: TERESA
D: I don't know, it's just -- these stocks, these crappy companies.

D: In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate. 21. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13

D: Why can't you be legitimate now?
C: JORDAN
D: It's not illegal, Teresa, technically. I mean they're real stocks, they're just...

D: Never gonna make anybody money. Wouldn't you feel better selling this junk to rich people, who can afford to lose the money at least?
E: a few beats; then

N: (MAR `90) The camera PUSHES IN on Jordan as he stands before a large dry erase board.
C: JORDAN
D: But what if they didn't sound like jerk-offs? What if I took this bunch of nincompoops and molded them in my own image? I reinvented the company, gave it a new image, a new name. Something patrician, blue-blooded, something that reeked of tradition and anti- semitism.
E: V.O.
N: And as his Brokers settle in to folding chairs--
C: JORDAN
D: Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton Oakmont. The clients we've gone after in the past -- they're done. We will now target exclusively the wealthiest one percent of Americans. The methods we've used -- over. Loud, obnoxious sales hype is worthless with these people. 23. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: JORDAN
D: In military terms it's like carpet- bombing -- noisy, menacing and only marginally effective. As Stratton brokers you will be laser- guided smart-bombs aimed at high- priority targets. You will establish an initial relationship with your clients selling only blue chip stocks -- then and only then will you attempt to sell the pink sheets, where the real money is. Now the key to every sale is this:
E: CONT'D
N: Jordan writes the word "URGENCY" on the board.
C: JORDAN
D: No one buys stock unless he thinks it's going up and going up now. You must convince your client to buy before the takeover happens, before the lawsuit is settled, before the patent is granted. If he says I'll think about it and call you back, it's over, you're dead! No one calls back! So you have to create urgency --
E: CONT'D
S: 48 INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY 48
N: Another day. With Stratton Oakmont signage visible in the b.g., Jordan is on speakerphone with a potential CLIENT, the other Brokers listening in.
C: JORDAN
D: --and once Kodak settles the lawsuit, institutions will be permitted to buy their shares in large blocks again. And when that happens, which is any day now, what do you think will happen to the price of Kodak stock?
C: CLIENT
D: It'll go up?
E: O.S.
C: JORDAN
D: Exactly. Which is why you should pick up 5000 shares today, a $200,000 investment.

D: Then you wait. Whoever speaks first loses. At this point, where are we in the sale? Chester?
C: CHESTER MING
D: About to close?
C: JORDAN
D: No, you sweet and sour douchebag! We're at the beginning of the beginning! This is where the sale starts. You as a salesman are almost hoping he says no so you can finally do your fucking job!
S: 52 INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY 52

N: Jordan stands before the Brokers.
C: JORDAN
D: He doesn't know, he needs to think, he's gotta ask his wife! The fact is it doesn't matter what the fuck he says! If he's already agreed that the stock's going up, then the only real objection he has at this point is he doesn't trust you! And he shouldn't trust you, you're a fucking salesman! So what do you say? 25. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
S: 54 INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY 54
N: Donnie talks on the phone to a Client.
C: DONNIE
D: Let me ask you this, sir -- had I been your broker for the past three to four years and made you money on a consistent basis, you probably wouldn't say you need to think about it, you'd probably say pick me up three or four thousand shares, am I right?
C: CLIENT #2
D: Maybe.

C: JORDAN
D: FYI, Danielle tells me she's using the money for breast implants! Is this a great company or what?!!
E: CONT'D
N: More wild applause as Jordan signals across the bullpen to Donnie. We hear the opening strains of "Stars & Stripes Forever" as he opens the door to a COLLEGE MARCHING BAND dressed in underwear and hats. The music continues as somersaulting GYMNASTS and BATON-TWIRLERS bring up the rear. As they march through the bullpen to cheers-- FROM THE KITCHEN -- two dozen TUXEDO-CLAD WAITERS emerge carrying trays of champagne and hors d'oeuvres. The music continues as two dozen STRIPPERS bolt in, gyrating among the BROKERS. As Jordan surveys the insanity:

N: Bustling with activity. Jordan enters, crosses toward his office. Off to the side of the bullpen, he notices three dozen YOUNG MEN in business suits. He approaches his assistant JANET, 20s, dressed all in black.
C: JORDAN
D: The hell's all this?

D: Mr. Belfort! Over here! Sir! 30. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: JORDAN
D: Forbes had made me a superstar. Every day dozens of money-crazed kids beat a path to my door with resumes they hadn't even bothered to spellcheck.
E: V.O.
N: Jordan crosses through the packed bullpen, where 150 BROKERS, no older than 22, are crammed elbow to elbow talking into phones. Some have pets, which they tend to while they work -- iguanas, snakes, turtles, even a chimp. Others are getting shoulder rubs by Masseuses or being fitted for suits by a TAILOR. Over the above:
C: JORDAN
D: If we hired `em, they dropped out of college overnight and blew whatever allowance they had on a new suit from our in-house tailor. The median age of our brokerage couldn't get served in the bar down the street.

N: Donnie gesticulates wildly. The guys crack up. WE PUSH IN ON Donnie, practically drooling, as Jordan gives us a quick tutorial on ludes... 79A QUAALUDE TUTORIAL *79A CUT TO: Extreme close up of guys doing drugs. *
C: JORDAN
D: The quaalude was first synthesized in 1951 by an Indian doctor -- that's dot Indian, not feathers -- as a sedative, and was prescribed to stressed housewives with sleep disorders. Pretty soon someone figured out that if you resisted the urge to sleep for fifteen minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass high from it. Didn't take long for people to start abusing ludes, `course, and in 1982 the U.S. Government Schedule One'd them, along with the rest of the world. Which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left. No shit, you can't even find `em anymore today. You people're all shit outta luck.

C: RUGRAT
D: My nutsack's about to explode.
C: ROBBIE *
D: Someone's gotta take that down.
N: There's no debate who that someone should be. Eyes locked on Naomi, Jordan makes his way downstairs. WITH NAOMI taking in the party, her eyes flitting to things: art, chandeliers, crystal, etc.
C: NAOMI
D: A lotta people would look at me and think: "golddigger, she's out to land the richest husband she can." But you see, I came from nothing. Like, below the poverty line. And when you come from nothing, being rich means never having to go back to that.
E: V.O.

N: Naomi's date Blair offers his hand to break them apart. Toby Welch lurks behind him, giving him the evil-eye.
C: BLAIR
D: Hi. Blair Hollingsworth.
N: Jordan barely acknowledges him, focused on Naomi. Outside, HILDY AZOFF chats with Teresa. Her eyes stray to Jordan chatting up Naomi. Teresa's eyes follow hers and sees them. Ouch. Hildy goes.
C: JORDAN
D: You're telling me you've never jet- ski'ed in your life?!
C: NAOMI
D: Never.
C: BLAIR
D: Y'know, we really should hit it, there's two other parties we're s'posed to get to --
C: JORDAN
D: What? You just got here. Stay.
N: Naomi looks like she'd like to. Hildy approaches, introduces herself, then:
C: HILDY
D: Jordan, Teresa needs your help.
C: JORDAN
D: With what?
C: HILDY
D: I dunno, you'll have to ask your wife what she wants.
N: Jordan sees: Teresa is watching from afar.

D: Donnie! What the fuck are you doing?!
N: During the melee that follows -- Hildy admonishing Donnie, Blair removing Naomi from the party --

D: The day I met Naomi was the day I truly became the Wolf. Every guy wanted her -- so I had to have her.

E: CONT'D re: his crotch
N: Jordan looks down: he has a morning erection.

N: Jordan kisses the baby, picks her up. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: JORDAN
D: Does Daddy get to kiss both his girls?
E: playing along
C: NAOMI
D: Ohhh, no! Daddy doesn't even get to touch Mommy for a very, very long time.
N: Naomi lays back on her elbows, thighs parted - she's wearing no panties. The wind goes out of Jordan.
C: JORDAN
D: C'mon, Nay, please. You know how sorry I am. I swear I--
C: NAOMI
D: Daddy shouldn't waste his time. And from now on it's going to be nothing but short, short skirts around the house! And Mommy's so sick and tired of wearing panties, uhhh. In fact she's decided to throw them all away. So take a good look. You'll be seeing an awful lot of it around the house, but no touching.
E: cutting him off parting her thighs
N: She licks her lips seductively. Jordan sets Skylar aside, starts grovelling.
C: NAOMI
D: What's wrong, Daddy?
E: CONT'D
N: Naomi slips her index finger in her mouth, starts sucking it. Jordan can barely speak.
C: JORDAN
D: C'mon, why are you doing this? I said I'm sorry.
C: NAOMI
D: Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to say how wrong he is when he's ready to come in his own pants. Isn't that right Dada? Mommy loves Daddy so, so much and there's nothing she wants to do more right now than to make love to Daddy all day long. Well, I guess it's time for Daddy to be taught his first lesson. 63. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
E: pouting
N: Naomi runs her fingers over her stomach and on to her inner thigh, then up toward her vagina. Jordan watches transfixed, then a change comes over him...
C: JORDAN
D: I wouldn't do that if I were you Mommy. I think Mommy should hear a story before she decides to please herself like that. Can Daddy tell Mommy a story? And does mommy promise to keep her legs spread wide, wide open the whole time? Good. Once upon a time there was a great big mansion in Long Island and the people who lived there had lots and lots of money. But of all the possessions they had, there was one thing that was much more valuable than all the rest combined, and that was their little baby daughter.
E: off her nod she nods dreamily
N: Naomi listens, legs still spread, hand on her crotch.
C: JORDAN
D: Now because he was very security- conscious, the Daddy hired two full-time guards, big hairy men both named Rocco, and they installed security cameras all around the house. And one of those cameras is right over Daddy's shoulder.
E: CONT'D

N: Donnie nods, turns to go, but suddenly he turns back and thrusts his arm in the bowl, grabbing for the squirming goldfish. The Broker in a bowtie looks on, horrified.
C: DONNIE
D: On new issue day?! On cocksucking, motherfucking new issue day?!
E: CONT'D
N: Dozen of Brokers and Sales Assistants look over as Donnie snatches up the fish. Holding it by its tail, he jumps * up on the desk of the Broker in a bowtie. Now the entire Bullpen looks over.
C: DONNIE
D: This is what happens when you fuck with your pets on new issue day!
E: CONT'D
N: With the flair of a showman, Donnie pops the fish in his mouth, swallowing it whole. The Brokers cheer wildly. Donnie jumps down, gets in the face of the Broker in a bowtie:
C: DONNIE
D: Now take your bowtie, get your shit and get the fuck out!
E: CONT'D
N: Bowtie is stunned. And as Donnie storms off, we PUSH IN on Jordan, watching from across the room.

D: Hey buddy.
N: And as they ad lib greetings, settle in at the couch:

E: into mic
N: The place slowly comes to order.
C: STEVE MADDEN
D: For those of you who don't know me, my name is Steve Madden. I'm --
E: CONT'D
C: ONE BROKER
D: We know who you are! 67. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
N: Steve clears his throat, looks over at Jordan -- he's terrified. Jordan motions for him to calm down.
C: STEVE MADDEN
D: I uh, I'd like to start by telling you about my background in the shoe industry.
C: ANOTHER BROKER
D: Nice fucking hat!
C: STEVE MADDEN
D: I uh... first started working in the shoe industry, in a shoe store. When I was sixteen, my friends were out chasing girls, but I was learning about women's shoes.
N: KALIL PETER DEBLASIO Move the mike closer. We can't fucking hear you! He moves the mic; feedback SCREECHES through the bullpen.
C: STEVE MADDEN
D: Sorry... Anyway, my first job was at a shoe store like I said where I worked in the stockroom. You know, I can honestly say I've been a lover of women's shoes since I was twelve--
E: CONT'D
C: BROKER #4
D: Freak!
C: STEVE MADDEN
D: No. Heh-heh. Not like that. I mean somehow I became fascinated with the endless design possibilities for women's shoes--
C: BROKER #5 BROKER #6
D: Queer! Get a fucking life!
N: Boos, hisses. Steve looks at Jordan, who motions for him to speed up. He grabs a shoe from one of the boxes.
C: STEVE MADDEN
D: This shoe -- the Mary Lou -- is the one that really put me on the map. It's a black patent leather variation of the Mary Jane, but--
E: CONT'D
N: SPLAT! A half-eaten grapefruit lands at Steve's feet. In a flash, Jordan rushes over, grabs the mic-- The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: JORDAN
D: All right, let's hear it for Steve Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou!
N: Huge applause, with stomping feet; howling, etc.
C: JORDAN
D: Okay, now that you got that out of your system, I want you to know why Steve is so completely off the fucking wall... It's because this man is a creative genius. Steve's power, his gift -- is that he creates trends. Artists like Steve come along once a century! Elvis! Andy Warhol! Giorgio Armani! Who knows how high this stock could go? The 20s? The 50s? The 80s?
E: CONT'D
N: Applause; war whoops. Jordan motions for quiet.
C: JORDAN
D: I want everybody to look down. See that little black box in front of you? It's called a telephone. Now I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about this telephone -- it won't dial itself! That's right -- until you take some action, it's nothing more than a worthless hunk of plastic, like a loaded M16 without a trained Marine to pull the trigger. And in the case of the telephone, it's the action of you, a highly trained Strattonite, a killer who will not take no for an answer! A person who will not hang up the phone until his client either buys or fucking dies!
E: CONT'D
N: The Brokers go crazy. Jordan looks around.
C: JORDAN
D: I don't care if you graduated from Harvard or Bumfuck University or never got past fourth fucking grade! That phone is the great equalizer! There is no nobility in poverty. I've been rich, and I've been poor and I choose rich every time. 69. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
E: CONT'D pause; looks around
C: JORDAN
D: At least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems, I show up in the back of a limo wearing a $2000 suit and $40,000 gold watch!
E: CONT'D
N: Jordan takes off his GOLD WATCH, flings it to the Crowd. Brokers go nuts, fighting over it like a home-run ball.
C: JORDAN
D: And if anyone here thinks I'm crazy, get the fuck out and get a job at McDonald's, because that's where you fucking belong! But before you depart this room full of winners, I want you to take a good look at the person next to you, because one day in the not-so- distant future, you'll be sitting at a red light in your beat-up old Pinto, and that person's gonna pull up in a brand new Porsche, with their gorgeous young wife at their side. And who will you be next to? Some ugly beast with three days of razor-stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in next to you with a carload of groceries from the fucking Price Club!
E: CONT'D
N: He scans the Brokers; they're on the edge of their seats.
C: JORDAN
D: So you listen to me and listen carefully. Are you behind on your credit card bills? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Is your landlord threatening to evict you? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking loser? Pick up the phone and start fucking dialing! I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich! I want you to go out and spend money! Leverage yourself, back yourself into a corner, let the consequences of failure become so fucking unthinkable that you'll have no choice but to do whatever it takes to win!
E: CONT'D
N: The Brokers go absolutely APESHIT. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: JORDAN
D: You have an obligation here, people! To your clients! To this firm! An obligation to yourself, godammit! You ram Steve Madden stock down your clients' throats and make them choke on it till they buy 20,000 shares! Be aggressive! Be ferocious! Be telephone fucking terrorists!!

C: JORDAN
D: Names and addresses of every guest at my wedding. Friends, clients. I even threw in the seating chart. Heard that's why you wanted the video, figured this'd expedite whatever it is you're doing. I wanted to show you I've got nothing to hide. I know you're investigating Stratton but for the life of me I can't figure out why. Sure, my company is unorthodox; what brokerage isn't? Maybe we're a little louder than most but we don't do anything illegal. Talk to the SEC, they'll tell you, they checked us out up and down.
E: Denham looks: it's indeed a guest list from the wedding
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: The SEC's actually a civil regulatory agency. We pursue criminal activity.

D: -- that'd be great. And if there's anything you can give me just to close out your file, get it off my desk--
C: JORDAN
D: -- sure, get you back to the real criminals --
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: -- then we could both profit from this little sit-down.
N: Jordan sizes him up: what did Denham mean by "profit"?
C: JORDAN
D: You sure you don't want anything to drink? Water for your pal? Rumor is your started out in finance. Even got your broker's license before you joined the bureau.
E: Denham demurs
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: Who told you that?
C: JORDAN
D: Jeez, who was it...? Ever regret it? Giving up the money-crazed, pin-striped life? Ever think where you'd be if you'd stuck with it?
E: searches his memory comes up short
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: When I'm riding the subway home, sweating my balls off, in a suit I've worn three days, sure.
C: JORDAN
D: Whattaya pull in working at the bureau, if you don't mind me asking. 50-60K a year?
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: Just about. We get a free handgun out of it, though, that doesn't suck. 77. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: JORDAN
D: S'crazy, the world we live in, the jobs with real value, the ones we should appreciate -- firefighters, teachers, FBI agents -- those are the ones we pay the least.
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: Way of the world.
C: JORDAN
D: That's one thing I like about what I do, the opportunity to make that right. Take this kid we had interning last year. Didn't want to be a broker, wanted to be an environmental scientist or something, he had a student loan debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway, his mom gets sick, all they can afford is third-rate care. Some of us got together, made an investment on his behalf and -- boom -- overnight everything changes, she's seeing the best doctors in the country. Sadly, didn't work out, she passed but still: having the power to do that makes all the other bullshit worth while. See, it's all about proper guidance, Pat. Knowing someone with the right relationships, who's discreet. I can change a life almost every day.
E: as Denham considers that
N: They measure each other.
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: How much that intern make off your deal?
C: JORDAN
D: North of half a million.
N: Denham summons Agent Hughes over. To Jordan:
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: Can you say that again, what you told me? I believe Mr. Belfort just tried to bribe a federal officer. 78. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
E: Jordan declines with a smile; to Agent Hughes
C: JORDAN
D: What? I was making conversation.
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: Sounds like that to me, Jordan.
C: JORDAN
D: ...no, no, no...
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: ...sounded like that...
C: JORDAN
D: ...no, to constitute a bribe, don't I have to make an explicit offer of money for services? With an exact dollar figure attached? All I said was "north" of half a million. According to the U.S. Criminal Code, that dog won't hunt, Pat. Heard you were a straight arrow. That you wouldn't bend the rules other agents might. He was right.
E: then
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: You did a background check on me?
C: JORDAN
D: Figured you were looking into me, was only fair. Plus you sail on a yacht fit for a Bond villain, sometimes you gotta act the part.
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: This is why you invited me down to your yacht? With a couple hookers on it --
C: JORDAN
D: -- those are friends --
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: -- to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you?
N: Jordan puts his hands up: "you got me."
C: JORDAN
D: Thanks for coming down. Now get off my boat.
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: You know, most of the Wall Street jackasses I bust, they were born to the life. 79. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: AGENT DENHAM
D: Their father was a douchebag before them, and his father before that. But you, you got this way all on your own. Good for you, Jordan. Thank you for having us. I'm absolutely certain we'll see each other again. You know, this is about the nicest boat I've ever been on. Just think what a hero I'll be in the office when the bureau seizes it.
E: CONT'D as he starts to go before he does
N: Jordan watches him go, temper flaring: he can't let Denham get the final word. He calls after them:
C: JORDAN
D: Hey, Denham! I'm gonna eat a claw of lobster now as I get my cock sucked by Heidi down below. You have a super ride home on the subway thinking about that! *
N: As he watches them pull away, seething --
C: JORDAN
D: He was a numbers guy, a follow-the- fucking-money'er. He wasn't gonna come at me through my guys, looking for a weak link and a quick kill. He was gonna come at me like an accountant would, the way Ness got Capone, through my books. Which meant? It was ass- covering time.

N: Jordan, Rugrat and Donnie drink coffee with Saurel and one other SWISS BANKER. It's an impressive office, with * an enormous fish tank.
C: DONNIE
D: We have a joke in America. "Heaven is a place where the police are Brits, the chefs are Italian, the car mechanics are German, the prostitutes are French and the bankers are Swiss." I never got it `til now -- look at those fucking fish! Come here, little guy...
C: SAUREL
D: Yes, we have the same joke here. Only sometimes the English are chauffeurs and the chefs are French. The Germans, alas, are always mechanics; no one wants to grant them more authority than that.
N: Polite laughter. Jordan, not as impressed by the fish,
T: cuts straight to the point:
C: JORDAN
D: I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws.
C: SAUREL
D: Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom requires ten minutes of idle chit- chat before business can be discussed. Of course, let's get "down to it." What would you like to know?
E: a smile
C: JORDAN
D: Under what circumstances would you be obligated to cooperate with an FBI or U.S. Justice Department investigation?
C: SAUREL
D: Ca depend.

D: Ca depend? Ca depend on what? 84. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13

D: What I'm asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over.
E: V.O.
C: SAUREL I understand perfectly, you
D: American shitheel.
E: V.O.
N: Saurel smiles.
C: SAUREL
D: The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in Switzerland. But there are very few Swiss laws pertaining to your "rumored" improprieties. Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is most appropriate: from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven, and we welcome you. If the U.S. Justice Department or FBI or SEC or IRS sent us a subpoena, it would become papier-toillette. We would wipe our ass with it.
N: Everyone's impressed. Except Jordan.
C: JORDAN
D: Unless it was an investigation into stock fraud -- which is a crime in Switzerland. Then you'd have to cooperate.
C: SAUREL
D: Yes, we would. Assuming the account is under your name. However, if it were in the name of a nominee of yours...
E: now he's impressed

C: NAOMI
D: Omigod, he's choking! Jordan, do something!!
N: Just then, WE HEAR the triumphant Popeye FANFARE -- Jordan looks to the TV, where POPEYE pours a can of spinach down his gullet. Instantly, his chest and arm muscles swell to five times their size. Jordan goes to get his coke. He snarfs up two fat spoonfuls and -- like that -- his chest swells and he takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue... Jordan rushes back to Donnie, who is now blue.
C: NAOMI
D: He's not breathing!
E: CONT'D
N: Jordan places his fingers over Donnie's artery. Nothing.
C: NAOMI
D: Save him!
E: CONT'D
N: Jordan kneels, starts furiously pumping Donnie's chest, breathing air into his lungs in rhythmic bursts.
C: JORDAN
D: This stupid sonovabitch! All Donnie ever did was fuck me up and now I had to save his life `cause I took a CPR class when the baby was learning to swim. Just for the record, I want it noted: not for a second did I even think about letting him choke to death, even though it would've saved me an awful lot of headaches.
E: V.O.
N: Donnie still isn't breathing. Jordan flips him over, tries the Heimlich -- we hear a CRUNCH as he breaks Donnie's ribs. He flips him back over, but he's almost completely blue. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13
C: JORDAN
D: He won't come back!
C: NAOMI
D: Don't let him die! He has children!
N: One last try. Jordan takes a massive breath, blowing as hard as he can into Donnie's lungs. Donnie's stomach distends like a balloon, then suddenly a chunk of ham projects from his mouth and into Jordan's face. Donnie coughs, vomiting. And as he starts breathing again, Jordan exits and passes out on the living room couch. *

C: JORDAN
D: What kind of terms?
C: MANNY RISKIN
D: You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations -- stock manipulation, high pressure sales tactics, ticky-tack shit like that. You pay a few million dollars in fines and in exchange the SEC fucks off for all time.

Five years ago when I started Stratton with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day would eventually come when I'd be moving on. It's truly with a heavy heart that I tell you that day is here.

D: Thank you for that and for your years of incredible loyalty and admiration. 106. The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13

E: CONT'D
N: A smattering of applause. Jordan notices a few Brokers gravely shaking their heads.

N: Donnie looks petrified; he's used to being an offensive tackle, not the quarterback.
C: JORDAN
D: Before I go, there's something I want to remind you all, and that's this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger than any one person, even me. Especially me. You guys are Stratton, each and every one of you, and that is why it's sure to remain the best brokerage firm in the fucking world!
N: Thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom, all 300 Brokers on their feet. WE PUSH IN on Jordan.
C: JORDAN
D: See, the very idea of Stratton is that when you come here and step into this bullpen for the first time, you start your life anew. You have a place here and no one can take that away from you! Stratton Oakmont is America! Give me your tired and poor! The very moment you walk through that door and pledge your loyalty to this firm, you become part of a family, you become a Strattonite! It doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter where you're from! Whether your family came over on the Mayflower or on a fucking inner tube from Haiti! 107.

D: Everybody here knows Kimmie Belzer, right?
E: CONT'D
N: Hoots and hollers... He raises his hand for quiet.
C: JORDAN
D: In case any of you weren't aware of it, Kimmie was one of Stratton's first brokers, one of the original twenty. Now when most of you met Kimmie, you met her the way she is today -- a beautiful woman who drives a brand new Mercedes, a woman who lives in the finest condo complex on Long Island. A woman who wears $3000 Armani suits, who spends her winters in the Bahamas and her summers in the Hamptons!
E: CONT'D
N: Wild applause.
C: JORDAN
D: But that's not the Kimmie I met. The Kimmie I met was broke, a single mom on the balls of her ass. Three months behind on her rent with an eight year old son! She came to me for a job and when I hired her she asked for a $5000 dollar advance so she could pay his tuition. And what did I do, Kimmie?
E: CONT'D

D: You wrote me a check for $25,000!

C: JORDAN
D: You know for years I've been telling you guys not to take no for an answer, to keep pushing, to not hang up the phone till you get what you want. This deal I'm about to sign, barring me from the securities industry, barring me from Stratton, my home... What the fuck is that? I'll tell you what it is, it's me being a hypocrite. It's me taking no for an answer, it's them selling me, not the other way around! Fuck it, I'm not leaving!
